As they don&amp;rsquo;t allow booting from ISO, we will need to use VirtualBox or other virtualization software for installing Haiku. This guide assumes that you already have a DigitalOcean account, you&amp;rsquo;re at least partly familiar with the interface and that you have already installed Haiku in a VM. You will need to obtain a disk image (*.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Haiku in Vultr</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/vultr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 19:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/vultr/</guid><description>Vultr allows one to upload a custom iso on their instances. With this, many new possibilities are open - such as setting up a buildbot, automated testing, benchmarking and more. This task assumes you have a Vultr account and that you are aware that it will charge you for setting up and running an instance.

Virtualizing an operating system might be a good way to give it a test run, or to use it alongside your main OS. ESXi is a platform that allows easy deployment of virtual machines on baremetal servers, and setting up a Haiku ESXi VM might be a good idea if you intend to develop Haiku or applications for it.</description></item><item><title>Virtualizing Haiku in Veertu Desktop</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/veertu-desktop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/veertu-desktop/</guid><description>Virtual instances of operating systems are perfect for all kinds of testing purposes that need to be done in a safe and isolated environment.

You can set Port Mode as either Host Pipe Mode or Raw File Mode when serial debugging with VirtualBox.
With Raw File Mode, you can easily and quickly save the debugged onto a .txt file whereas it might be rather difficult for to check out the content of debugging real time. When it comes toÂ Host Pipe Mode, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated than the Raw File Mode, but you can confirm what is being debugged real time.</description></item><item><title>Virtualizing Haiku in Hyper-V</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/hyper-v/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 10:32:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/hyper-v/</guid><description>For Google Code-In 2017, Arnav Bhatt created a video on how to install Haiku in Hyper-V [11 MiB].
There are two methods for installing Haiku: RAW images and Anyboot images. RAW images consist of a pre-installed environment, whereby the Virtual Hard Disk is of a fixed size. By using a RAW image, you do not need to go through the installation process. The Anyboot images, on the other hand, can be burnt to a CD-RW or DVD-RW, or even a USB drive but they can also be used in Hyper-V, to create a virtual CD-ROM that can be used to install Haiku onto a virtual Hard Disk or even to just boot into Haiku directly.</description></item><item><title>VirtualBox Serial Debugging on Linux</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/virtualbox-linux-debugging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 15:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/virtualbox-linux-debugging/</guid><description>This tutorial describes using a feature of VirtualBox that writes the output of a serial port into a file on the host machine. Because Haiku, by default, writes debug information to the COM1 port, you can use it to quickly extract stacktraces to text files, for example.
This tutorial is based on following tools:
