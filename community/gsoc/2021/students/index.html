our <a href=https://review.haiku-os.org/>change review tool</a>. This could either be a
<a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;summary=~easy">task marked easy</a>,
<a href="https://xref.landonf.org/source/search?q=TODO&amp;defs=&amp;refs=&amp;path=&amp;hist=&amp;project=haiku">TODO commented in code</a>,
<a href=../../../../development/coding-guidelines.html>code style cleanup</a>, or any other
unlisted task. Submitting code that relates to your project will indicate a
higher level of understanding and ability. The number and difficulty of resolved
issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is
suggested to <strong>set the topic to "gsoc2021" on submissions</strong>,
as this facilitates finding them in the future.</li><li><strong>Why do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?</strong><br>This serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills
that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or
inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing
lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight
into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity
for you, the student, to showcase yourself and to convince us that you are indeed
the right person for the job.<br>The code contribution is a very important part of your application.
<strong>Students who did not submit one, or submit something insufficient, will
not be accepted into the program.</strong></li><li><strong>Should I use Haiku R1/beta1 or a newer nightly image?</strong><br>As a developer, you will be working with the most recent code and test your changes
on the development branches, so a nightly image is recommended. You can use
either a 32bit or 64bit one, as you prefer.</li></ul><a id=impress></a><h3>Making a Positive Impression</h3><p>In open source work, communication is the key. You will be working remotely, and will need to communicate with your mentor, and other members of the Haiku community, over the Internet. Show us you're able to work this way and interact with other Haikuers in a productive and efficient way.</p><ul><li><a href=https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/SubmittingPatches>Submit a patch</a>:<ul><li><strong>that relates to your project</strong></li><li>is quality code that conforms to our <a href=../../../../development/coding-guidelines.html>Coding Guidelines</a></li><li>feel free to submit more than one patch!</li></ul><li>Have a positive impact on mailing lists, <a href=https://dev.haiku-os.org/>bug tracker</a>, and other public spaces</li><li>Do your homework; show that you have:<ul><li>researched your project</li><li>an understanding of what needs to be done</li><li>a proper plan for accomplishing it, which includes quantifiable goals and timelines</li></ul></li><li>Submit an alternate proposal, as this provides our mentors with flexibility for choosing the best students, rather than the best project ideas</li></ul><a id=advice></a><h3>Words of Advice</h3><p>Reading and following this advice will do wonders for ensuring
that your <i>Google Summer of Code</i> experience will be something to be proud of.</p><ol><li><strong>Plan your time</strong><br><i>Google Summer of Code</i> has a project duration of 175 hours. This gives
some flexibility as you don't need to work full-time on it every week.
However, be sure to plan ahead and dedicate some time to Haiku. Make sure you
will not be overworked by other commitments (university exams or courses, for
example). In your application we ask you to provide a tentative schedule so
we can know in advance how you plan to distribute the 175 hours over the
summer. We can check if that seems realistic or if your initial plan is already
very busy, leaving no margin for catch-up in case something unexpected happens.
For example, combining GSoC with another full-time job is likely a bad idea.</li><li><strong>Communicate every other day</strong><br>The haiku-gsoc mailing list is to be used at all times by you.
Provide regular reports. Nothing formal, just one or two lines.
It is important for your mentors to have a clear picture of what you are doing, have done, and plan to do.
While being self-sufficient is a worthwhile trait, it is not an ideal trait for a Google Summer of Code participant -- Haiku expects you to utilize our mentors, that is why they are there.</li><li><strong>Provide code frequently</strong><br>There is a saying in open source -- commit often, commit frequently.
Take that advice to heart.
Smaller patches and code snippets are easier for the mentors to review.
It also gives them more chances to suggest better approaches and keep you on target.
In turn, this will make you more productive and more likely to succeed!
You can put your work in progress changes in our code review tool so your mentor and other developers can help you spot the problems. It is perfectly fine to share non-working code, in fact a lot of the changes listed in the code review tool are in this state and several iterations will be needed to get things right.</li><li><strong>When you do not have code, it is even more critical to converse frequently.</strong><br>If you aren't coding, what are you doing?
How are you moving closer to your goal?
What problems are you analyzing?
What questions and ideas do you have?
Every year, many students get stuck on an issue and spend too much time trying to solve it by themselves, when a mentor would have helped them progress much faster. This isn't a school assignment, we will not fail you for asking too many questions.</li></ol><a id=passorfail></a><h3>Pass or Fail Criteria</h3><p>As you know, <i>Google Summer of Code</i> has three monthly evaluation points.
If you happen to receive
a failing mark at either point, you are not paid that portion and your
internship comes to an abrupt end. There are two areas
that are considered during the evaluation: code output and
communication/interactions.</p><p>A word of caution -- do not expect to make miracles during the week
of mid-term or final evaluations. Instead, expect your mentor to
evaluate your progress on the first day of the window.</p><ol><li><strong>Code.</strong><br>This includes everything from 'commit worthy' patches to all the code
(and non-code, such as design documents or pseudo code) leading up to
that polished patch. In other words, if for some reason you and your
mentor pursue an approach that turns out to be a dead end you will not
be punished.</li><li><strong>Communication.</strong><br>This includes discussions on the haiku-development list,
talking with haiku developers on IRC,
posting the Milestone Blog/Email Reports.</li></ol><p>In other words, <strong>you will be writing code and talking with
one or more mentors on a daily basis.</strong> Anything less will
hurt your mid-term and final evaluation! Do not expect to be able
to cram days, weeks, or months of work into a shorter period and
receive a passing evaluation.</p><a id=template></a><h3>Application Template</h3><p>This application template has two sections.</p><ol><li>A fill-in-the-blank section with basic information.</li><li>An open-ended section with suggestions for content to include.
