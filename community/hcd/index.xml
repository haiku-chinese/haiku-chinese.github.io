Unlike last year, where a public vote was held to select the students, our mentors have determined the combinations of &amp;lt;student&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;mentor&amp;gt;. Since our requirements for Google Summer of Code were greatly improved upon from last year, our mentors were able to confidently decide which of those combinations have the highest chance of succeeding. Full-text indexing and search tool for Haiku Student: Ankur Sethi Mentor: Rene Gollent Project Abstract A plugin-based, full-text file indexing tool for Haiku, similar in functionality to OSX's Spotlight, GNOME's Tracker and SkyOS's Index Feeder.</description></item></channel></rss>
