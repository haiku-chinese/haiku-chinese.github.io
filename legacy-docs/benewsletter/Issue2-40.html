I Think I Might Have Bought an NC</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Erich</span> <span class="surname">Ringewald</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Ever interested in broadening my understanding of the world around me, I
recently checked into the web sites of IBM, Sun, and NCI (the subsidiary
of Oracle which incorporated Navio and is dedicated to producing network
computers under the benevolent and watchful eye of Larry Ellison) to have
a look at their NC offerings.
</p><p>
An NC, as far as I can tell, is a computer designed to run a web browser,
has a convincing Java implementation, can't be screwed up by the user,
has no local storage, can be booted from a server and configured remotely
by an all-knowing authority. Also, it should be cheap. And most people
seem to think it would be a good idea if it did all this without any
Microsoft software whatsoever, although that's mostly coming from
manufacturers, not end users.
</p><p>
Some quick perusals of the web sites quickly yield a fairly traditional
profile: a slim box with a non-Intel processor, no IDE, serial, parallel,
or any peripheral connectors to speak of, an SVGA connector, keyboard and
a mouse. Usually they're packaged in a handsome black design, and carry
price tags around $700 (to start, monitor not included).
</p><p>
Of course, the value of these things is lower cost of ownership, and
we're not just talking about purchase price, because we all know the real
price comes from operational costs after the machine has been bought.
</p><p>
What I don't quite understand is the reason for a whole new computer to
run this new software. I actually just bought a machine down the street
(for which purpose I'll not disclose) which on closer inspection was a
lot like the machine I just described. I saw it advertised in a not very
elegant ad in Microtimes:
</p><pre class="screen">
166 MHz Pentium MMX
32 MB RAM
1.44 MB Floppy
S3 Accelerated Graphics (2MB RAM)
Case/Power Supply
Keyboard/Mouse

Price: $495.
</pre><p>
It needs a monitor, but as it stands, it seemed like it would make a
pretty powerful NC. But what it needs is software.
</p><p>
You see, if I forget about all that fancy NC hardware which people want
to sell me, and focus on the software which might make the machine I
mention above an easily and remotely configurable NC, I realize that the
NC argument is and should be a software argument. The computer above,
relieved from the worries of a previous life imposed by Windows '95,
could remotely (DHCP/BootP) retrieve a nice, simple and fast OS designed
for web based computing and be as cost-effective an NC as anything in a
fancy box from a NC hardware manufacturer.
</p><p>
I guess it's just more fun to build your own hardware. Or maybe it's
easier to disguise your real intent. Never underestimate the possible
manifestations of that less talked about Freudian condition, "Bill Gates
Envy."
</p><p>
To paraphrase an old saying, if you're a hardware company, everything
looks like a hardware problem, even a software problem.

So, is a spinlock a good thing? Last week when I went over what might be
a typical spinlock implementation, astute readers immediately pointed out
the flaws in the implementation, which is a good thing. I'll get back to
that.
</p><p>
Why would you bother trying to implement such things in the first place?
Well, many times you might think system resources are limited and must be
preserved at all cost, and that system overhead must be minimized
wherever possible. This sometimes leads developers to try and optimize
areas they believe to be piggish before looking at their own algorithms.
</p><p>
Why did I use spinlocks as an example? Because, there is often times an
assumption by speed demons that any function that calls into the kernel
must be slow, and therefore is subject to optimization. Spinlocks are
often thought of as a mechanism that provides a faster fine grain locking
mechanism than semaphores.
</p><p>
The BeOS is a awesome system to work with, and very efficient at many
things. If you have experience with other operating systems that do
multi-threading, you might think it would be piggish doing certain things.
</p><p>
Multithreading from the bottom to the top is truly our motto. This has
been the case from the first Hobbit-based BeBox to the multi-Pentium
systems we run on today. If there is one thing we do right and
efficiently, it's dealing with multiple threads running on multiple CPUs.
That includes scheduling, locking critical areas, managing interrupts,
etc. I think the BeOS handles these features much better than many other
operating systems I have used in recent history.
</p><p>
One feature of programming in a new environment is that there are not
shelf loads of books of the "Undocumented" variety available yet.
Although this form of book tends to be a bit tedious at times, they do
offer one very useful insight. You can typically find out the things that
the standard documentation didn't tell you. That is, patterns of usage,
and boundary cases.
</p><p>
The BeOS documentation is wonderful in explaining how things work, and
although we try to tell you every minute detail of using every function,
we may not meet your needs in all instances. But, being the industrious,
inquisitive undaunted programmer that you are, you've taken to reading
through headers to supplement your knowledge as much as you can. Of
course this process is not ideal and in certain areas you must deduce
certain behavior, and sometimes those deductions can be wrong.
</p><p>
If you are interested in how to control a thread's access to critical
data, or interested in controlling the order of processing that occurs in
your application, you absolutely must read the documentation on
semaphores, which can be found on your BeOS disk at:
</p><p>
file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/kernel/sems.html
</p><p>
If you are new to multithreaded programming, but you love to do
experiments with programming, you might do some reading on semaphores and
come to the conclusion that you can do better. Last week's sample code is
a typical example of how you might try to implement it on your own.
</p><p>
For instance, if you're coming from the UNIX/Solaris/Linux world, you
might have read "UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures" by Curt Schimel
and come across section 9.2 Spin-Locks. It seems like a good idea. A fine
grained locking mechanism that doesn't do too much other than waste CPU
cycles. So you start to implement...
</p><p>
First you see that you need a <code class="function">test_and_set()</code> function. It needs to flush
caches and test and set a value in an atomic way. Using swap_atomic is
what is advocated, so you go traipsing through the Be documentation
looking for such a function. Not finding it directly, you start looking
through headers and come across <code class="filename">SupportDefs.h</code>
which has nifty things like
<code class="function">atomic_add</code>, <code class="function">atomic_and</code>,
<code class="function">write_32_swap</code>, and the like. You take a gamble
and come up with:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="function">test_and_set</code>(volatile <span class="type">long *</span><code class="parameter">addr</code>)
{
    <span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">old_value</code>;
    <code class="varname">old_value</code> = <code class="function">write_32_swap</code> (<code class="parameter">addr</code>, 1);
    if (<code class="varname">old_value</code> == 0)
        return 0;
    return 1;
}
</pre><p>
It's close, but not quite. First, the <code class="function">write_32_swap()</code> doesn't return a
<span class="type">int</span>, but your compiler doesn't complain, so you think you're safe.
</p><p>
The code that will call this function wants to do one thing. If the value
is 0, then set it to one atomically and return the fact that it was 0. If
it is 1, then return the fact that is a one.
</p><p>
The proper way of doing this is to use the <code class="function">atomic_or</code> function. The
<code class="function">atomic_xxx</code> functions return the value that was in the variable before it
was changed. Thus, if it were already a 0, it would return that and the
current value would now be a 1. If it were a 1 to begin with, it will
return that, and it will remain a 1. Ahhh... perfect.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="function">test_and_set</code>(volatile <span class="type">long *</span><code class="parameter">addr</code>)
{
    return <code class="function">atomic_or</code>(<code class="parameter">addr</code>, 1) ? 1 : 0;
}
</pre><p>
But you're not done. There may be multiple CPUs in the system. Do you
need to flush caches explicitly so that the other CPUs will know that the
memory address changed? Do you even know how to get to the caches? Or did
that happen for you automatically when you used the atomic_or function?
And how costly is that spinning anyway?
</p><p>
In the BeOS, and any other system for that matter, the atomic_xxx
operations are supposed to be guaranteed by the OS vendor to do all those
things. Flush caches if necessary, and utilize the proper CPU
instructions to achieve the desired action while disallowing other
actions from interfering.
</p><p>
The critical method of the <code class="classname">ASpinLock</code> class is
the <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> method itself.
It does the <code class="function">test_and_set</code> forever until it actually gets a hold of the
"lock." Is this a good thing to do in user space? Not necessarily. Since
the BeOS is preemptive, your process is subject to rescheduling. That
means the kernel gets involved and does some context switching, which is
what you might have been trying to avoid in the first place.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="classname">ASpinLock</code>::<code class="methodname">Lock</code>()
{
  while (<code class="function">test_and_set</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">fLockStatus</code>) == 1)
    ;
  return 0;
}
</pre><p>
What does that leave you with? Back to the <code class="classname">Benaphore</code>? Yes, of course. A
Benaphore as explained in a previous newsletter article is a very fast,
efficient locking mechanism. It has been written, debugged, and presented
for your usage in the documentation. It does a quick test on a atomic
variable, and then uses a semaphore if necessary. Yes, you make a trip to
the kernel, but you were probably headed there anyway.
</p><p>
Spinlocks are still a very useful locking mechanism, when implemented
correctly and in the right places. If you are writing kernel device
drivers, spinlocks are your best friend for protecting critical sections
of code. You will find
<code class="filename">drivers/KernelExport.h</code> provides you with the
appropriate function calls for your device driver to handle spinlocks.
The following header file comment gives you a good idea of proper
spinlock usage:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="comment">/*---
  spinlocks. Note that acquire/release should be called with
  interrupts disabled.
---*/</span>
</pre><p>
That right there is your clue the spinlocks aren't quite as easy to
implement as they seem.
</p><p>
In short, we do the work, so you don't have to. We speak to CPU vendors
and find those special commands that make atomic actions work on 603,
604, x86 and other CPUs. They aren't always obvious, and usually require
assembly coding. Fine grained locking is typically something you do in
the kernel space; in user space, you're better off with the semaphore and
Benaphore techniques.
</p><p>
Armed with a locking mechanism, what can you do? What good are they
anyway? It seems they will just slow down your application.
</p><p>
Locking mechanisms are the most fundamentally useful techniques to use in
a multi-threading, multi-CPU environment. If you are new to all this,
then I would recommend some reading: "Object-Oriented Multithreading
Using C++" by Cameron Hughes and Tracy Hughes (Wiley). This is not a book
on doing multi-threaded programming on the BeOS, but it does cover many
of the features, concepts and techniques common to any multithreading
environment.

This refers, of course, to our latest BeOS release, DR 9.1, also known as
Preview Release 2 (or PR2). If we go by the conventional wisdom of
numbering conventions, since the "1" numeral is on the right hand side of
the decimal point, this is a minor release. We know how this very
convention keeps being abused for obvious marketing reasons, or more
tortuous contractual ones, but, in our case, we don't mind the label.
</p><p>
One could summarize PR2 as the product of things we shouldn't have done,
bugs, or things we should have done, features that didn't quite make it
into the original Preview Release (PR1), such as, but not limited to,
better handling of HFS volumes or the 3D kit. This doesn't mean we're not
happy and proud of this latest release, we feel indeed it is a nice ".1"
release, but, on the other hand, we're just doing what we're supposed to
do.
</p><p>
The Preview Release was a risky effort, entailing many internal changes
in the foundation of our OS, the new 64-bit file system being the most
visible one. As a result, we were late by about 6 months, not an uncommon
occurrence, but not an excuse either. With this in mind, one piece of
good news regarding PR2 is we're back on track, correcting problems and
adding features on a more regular basis.
</p><p>
As always, what we think of our work matters only very little. The
verdict is in the hands of developers and early adopters. With PR1, we
saw the beginning of commercial BeOS applications being shipped and sold.
We hope PR2 will make life easier for our partners and customers and will
generate the most precious commodity in our business, positive
word-of-mouth.
</p><p>
Speaking of which... We owe thanks to all developers and users who gave
us feedback after PR1 came out. Their comments, positive and negative,
have given us information and motivation for the improvements, visible or
not, you'll find in PR2.
</p><p>
As usual, we're nervous when a new release comes out: Have we overlooked
some obvious problem, are we causing incompatibility grief to our
developers, in our eagerness to correct problems have we caused more
damage? We'll know very soon and, if need be, we'll post updates on our
site.
</p><p>
From now on, our focus is on the Intel release and on helping BeOS
developers test that version as soon as practical in order to open the
gates to this bigger market in the most effective fashion for all of us.
This is a new set of challenges. We realize there is more to the Intel
world than a new instruction set, but we look forward to the task
nonetheless.

The initial request, as described by the Subject line, led to a
discussion of the nature of attributes, the BFS Btree, and the speed of
the file system. Be's Dominic Giampaolo ran some tests that stressed
the file system's ability to update its indices, posted his findings,
pointed out the system's shortcomings, and vowed to improve the
situation. Other listeners called in with their own benchmarks and a
few questions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Since it's not possible to have "invisible" files, what should
you do to protect attribute-only files from being deleted by a
curious user?
</p><p>
A number of listeners suggested that attribute-only files sounds like
a database—and the BFS isn't meant for industrial-strength
database support.
</p></li><li><p>
Will multi-user support change the way attributes are
stored/protected/accessed?
</p><p>
Some listeners objected to the practice of storing user-info
(configurations, protections, etc.) as attributes of a file. The
popular opinion is that files should be protected by uid/gid and the
permission flags—files shouldn't be selectively shared based on
the value of an attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
How many files within a single directory are "too many"?
</p><p>
Some difference of opinion, here. There was some consensus that once
you get in the 10,000 file range, you'll start to lose performance.
But is it the file system or the Tracker that's the culprit? It was
offered that displaying (and Node Monitoring) 10k files takes a
significant bite—but, then again, a window that contains that many
files isn't a great user experience at any speed.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id591645"></a>Subject: Networking woes</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: restarting networking</h5></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Do you need a hub to get a BeBox to talk to another computer?
</p><p>
Nope, (says Stephen Beaulieu), all you need is a "cross-over cable."
Want more info? Ken Causey pointed out this URL:
</p><p>
http://wwwhost.ots.utexas.edu/ethernet/10quickref/ch5qr_5.html#HEADING4
</p></li><li><p>
How do you restart networking programmatically?
</p><p>
The simple answer: You can't.
</p><p>
A longer discussion ensued: Is there any reason to restart
networking? It would be better if changes to network settings were
propagated as they occur, rather than dropping connections and
demanding that the net daemon be re-launched. It was agreed that
while the current implementation isn't ideal, it's considerably
nicer than demanding a reboot. Or is it? Osma Ahvenlampi says...
</p><p>
"For a server, it's the same thing. Who cares if the machine [is
rebooting] or not, if all the network connections go down, it's
down."
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id591702"></a>Subject: libraries and source code</h4></div></div></div><p>
An old friend re-visited: Should a developer use a library that doesn't
include source code? To a library developer (as is Jeff Abrahamson, who
re-started the ball rolling), the issues are these:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If the source code is included, piracy is more likely.
</p></li><li><p>
If you don't include source, developers are less likely to use
the library for fear of not getting adequate support (they'd like to
be able to patch the code themselves).
</p></li></ul><p>
Mr. Abrahamson continued with a proposal:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Does it suffice to have the *option* of purchasing the full source
code for, say, twenty times the cost of the library... You don't need
to buy it unless you have a problem, but if you do you can always spend
the money to buy the source.</span>”
</p><p>
Ed Musgrove modified the "no source, no service" attitude:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We developers are interested in debugging—we do not need the source
code for any other reason. A sophisticated solution might be to create
a <code class="code">#ifdef DEBUG</code> block and ship two versions of the library.</span>”
</p><p>
This was seconded by a number of entrants. An additional thought, that
all library developers should place their source code in escrow in
anticipation of belly up day, was also heartily cheered.
</p><p>
Jon Watte didn't disagree, but that didn't stop him:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...anything starting with two underscores is the SOLE property of the
compiler vendor. You should not use it. It is not ANSI, it is not
portable, with the exception of the <code class="code">__cplusplus</code> constant (and other
well-defined constants such as <code class="code">__STDC__</code>)</span>”
</p><p>
and
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...<code class="code">#ifdef</code> is a left-over from the first version of K&amp;R C that should
not be used in modern production code, because it is inflexible and
there is a better variant: <code class="code">#if defined(x)</code></span>”
</p><p>
This led to another topic: Should bad code be forced to crash? Two
schools:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
It's bad for the user if a program crashes. Better to give the
app the benefit of the doubt (and the user a more pleasant
experience) by not <code class="function">assert()</code>ing argument formats and types.
</p></li><li><p>
It's bad to write sloppy code. And sloppy programmers are
probably also sloppy testers. We should force the bums to eat their
own code.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id591844"></a>Subject: Compatibility vs. "The Right Way"</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is binary and API compatibility worth maintaining at the cost of lost
improvements and features? Relatedly, does the impending Intel release
have anything to be compatible with?
</p><p>
A number of listeners phoned in to say that breaking the API between
PPC and Intel is not a good thing—they may not affect each other
directly, but maintaining two sets of API is never desirable.
</p><p>
This led to the broader question of cross-compiles and testing: Should
a developer cross-compile to a platform that isn't sitting on the other
side of the room? Some folks think that "absentee" development is prone
to bugs. But Bill Morris has a slightly different attitude:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Strangely enough I code Java on the Mac using CodeWarrior and Netscape
3.0 just to avoid having to do that [test on each platform]. The basic
theory is that since Java on Netscape 3.0 for Mac is absolutely
horrible if it works there it will work better everywhere else...</span>”
</p><p>
One of our more frequent contributors suggested that a cross-compile
panacea is a pipe dream. Another frequent contributor objected, citing
a known, if defunct, example. Fur flew a bit.

A follow-up to the recent "BeOS as a Server" thread. This week:
Security. If, as some people hold, the BeOS is to be a credible server
OS, it needs to have tighter security. Thoughts?
</p><p>
Encryption schemes, security authentication methods and levels, network
protocols, user authorization... There was no end to the topics.
Michael Crawford lightened this acronymically-inclined thread with a

“<span class="quote">One thing they had to do was install a power line filter because the
inspector thought that spies could read the data off the power line
from across the harbor. They found a filter in a surplus yard that my
dad described as costing tens of thousands of dollars when new...
Another thing they do in secure installations—you _can_ use a
network, but you have to ensure no one taps into the net. The way they
do that is to run the wire through a pressurized pipe. If someone
drills into the pipe, then the pressure loss sets off alarms.</span>”
