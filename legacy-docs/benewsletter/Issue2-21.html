The beauty and sensibility of a final result often belies the time and
effort that went into creating it. Good dancers appear to have been born
moving effortlessly. An attractive, well-dressed human being likely
didn't wake up looking quite so polished. Everything we see, from the
most majestic landscape to the least significant spore, required a period
of growth. Whatever the refinement of the result, this means that
everything went through periods of lankiness and growing pains. Puppy
paws appear far too big for the legs they're mounted on. A baby's head
dwarfs its tiny body. When growing, dependencies require that some parts
grow faster and be in place sooner than others. A browse through the DR9
Advanced Access header files will hint at things to come, like multiple
displays. The header file Screen.h describes the new API for applications
to obtain information about screens in a remarkably dynamic multiple
screen environment.
</p><p>
Imagine a full multitasking operating system that will allow displays to
come and go at will. Let's say the user is done at the office (imagine!)
and—without restarting—unplugs his BeOS notebook from his 17"
monitor, tucks it under his arm, and takes it home. Without any help, the
OS notices that the 17" CRT is gone and the 14" built-in LCD display
should be the new main screen. In a flurry of windows moving and
updating, everything in the system shifts to the new configuration with
no surprises for the user.
</p><p>
Certainly a nice image. But not without a few minor problems to solve.
For instance, how does a program refer to specific screens when they can
appear and disappear at will? It cannot use a pointer, as it is hard to
tell when the pointer is invalid, and the consequences for misuse are
dire. Neither can it use a "GetNthScreen" call, as the screen indexes
will change when screens are added and removed (when monitor 1 is
removed, monitor 2 becomes monitor 1, monitor 3 becomes monitor 2, and so
on).
</p><p>
The solution is the screen_id, a unique, opaque 32-bit identifier,
representing a screen attached to the computer. When a screen is
disconnected, its <span class="type">screen_id</span> falls into permanent disuse. When it is
reconnected, it is assigned a new ID. Because screen_ids are meant to be
lightweight, they are not persistent across boots. A solution involving
far more than 32 bits will be developed later to persistently identify
screens.
</p><p>
And, now the star of the show. The <code class="classname">BScreen</code> is an extremely lightweight,
easy to construct class that represents a single screen. <code class="classname">BScreen</code>s are
meant to be constructed immediately when information is needed, and to
exist for as short a time as possible. Although construction and
destruction take insignificant time, some of the calls (such as
BaseAddress and BytesPerRow) are slower than you might expect because
they involve a synchronous round-trip AppServer request.
</p><p>
To prevent race conditions with the results of the <code class="classname">BScreen</code> functions, the
display will not change when any <code class="classname">BScreen</code> objects referring to it are in
existence. The display is locked in the <code class="classname">BScreen</code>'s constructor and freed
in the destructor so neither the Screen preferences panel nor anybody
else will be able to change the horizontal or vertical size, bit depth,
color palette, or anything else that might affect client applications.
This is why it is extremely important to destroy the <code class="classname">BScreen</code>, allowing
the display to change again, as soon as possible. A user won't react
kindly to an application hogging his screen, and when informed which is
the culprit (it's not hard to figure out who is misusing the <code class="classname">BScreen</code>),
will remorselessly blow it away.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BScreen</code> {

    <code class="classname">BScreen</code>( <span class="type">screen_id</span> id=<code class="constant">B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID</code> );
    <code class="classname">BScreen</code>( <span class="type"><code class="classname">BWindow</code> *</span><code class="parameter">win</code> );
    ~<code class="classname">BScreen</code>();
</pre><p>
The best way to construct a <code class="classname">BScreen</code> object is to pass in a window. The
constructor will return the screen that contains that window (or the
majority of the window). If you need more flexibility, you can pass the
ID of the desired screen. Because <code class="classname">BScreen</code>s are meant to be created on the
stack, the destructor should be called automatically. Manually creating
and deleting <code class="classname">BScreen</code>s on the heap is a sure recipe for leaks (again,
likely leading to an irate user and your application's unceremonious
termination).
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="methodname">IsValid</code>();
</pre><p>
When screens can come and go at will, it will be possible for the <code class="classname">BScreen</code>
constructor to be passed a <span class="type">screen_id</span> which is no longer valid. The
<code class="classname">BScreen</code> will be constructed anyway, but will refer to the main screen
instead of the screen you asked for. This is so you don't have to do
error checking every single time you construct a <code class="classname">BScreen</code>. Accidentally
using the main screen will prevent crashing, and will generally produce
acceptable results anyway. IsValid will return false if the <code class="classname">BScreen</code>
refers to the main screen instead of the screen you asked for.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

</pre><p>
These calls are pretty much self-explanatory, except that <code class="methodname">WaitForRetrace</code>
is temporarily unimplemented (it just returns <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code> right now).
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <span class="type">uint8</span>      <code class="methodname">IndexForColor</code>( <span class="type">rgb_color</span> rgb );
    <span class="type">uint8</span>      <code class="methodname">IndexForColor</code>( <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">r</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">g</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">b</code>,

    <span class="type">rgb_color</span>  <code class="methodname">ColorForIndex</code>( <span class="type">constuint8</span> <code class="parameter">index</code> );
</pre><p>
The BeOS has a system color table that applies to every bitmap, every
8-bit screen, basically everywhere indexed color is used. VRAM is cheap
enough now that if you need realistic color, it is much easier to simply
set the display to 32-bit color than to manage and arbitrate the palette
(even with full OS support). So why not make these calls global? Because
even though this capability will likely go unused in the BeOS, the
hardware DOES allow each individual screen to have its own color
environment.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <span class="type">uint8</span>        <code class="methodname">InvertIndex</code>( <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">index</code> );
</pre><p>
Passed a color index, <code class="methodname">InvertIndex</code> returns the index of a suitable
inverse. It uses the inversion map returned by <code class="code"><code class="methodname">ColorMap</code>()-&gt;<code class="varname">inversion_map</code></code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <span class="type">constcolor_map*</span> <code class="methodname">ColorMap</code>();
</pre><p>
<code class="methodname">ColorMap</code>() allows you to save time by doing your own table lookups. Don't
use the color map after its <code class="classname">BScreen</code> has been destructed. Suitably bad
things will happen.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <span class="type">rgb_color</span>    <code class="methodname">DesktopColor</code>();

</pre><p>
These set the screen's desktop color. If stick is <code class="constant">true</code>, then it saves the
change to disk. If not, then the desktop color change will last only
until the computer is restarted.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
};

inline <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="classname">BScreen</code>::<code class="methodname">IndexForColor</code>( <span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="parameter">rgb</code> )

    <code class="parameter">rgb</code>.<code class="varname">alpha</code> ); }
</pre><p>
Finally, a pinch of syntactic sugar.
</p><p>
Let's see how to use <code class="classname">BScreen</code>. First, a simple example that draws a
rectangle, colored the inverse of the desktop color, in a view.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>( <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">where</code> )
{
    <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">area</code>( 10, 10, 110, 110 );
    <span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="varname">deskcolor</code>;

    <code class="classname">BScreen</code> <code class="varname">screen</code>( <code class="methodname">Window</code>() );

    <span class="comment">// Now, the screen containing the majority of the window</span>
    <span class="comment">// has been locked. It will not change while the</span>
    <span class="comment">// function is executing.</span>

    <code class="varname">deskcolor</code> = <code class="varname">screen</code>.<code class="methodname">DesktopColor</code>();
    if( <code class="varname">screen</code>.<code class="methodname">ColorSpace</code>() == <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code> ) {
        <span class="comment">// do the inversion calculation using indexed colors</span>
        <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="varname">icol</code> = <code class="varname">screen</code>.<code class="methodname">InvertIndex</code>(
            <code class="varname">screen</code>.<code class="methodname">IndexForColor</code>(<code class="varname">deskcolor</code>) );
        <code class="methodname">SetHighColor</code>( <code class="varname">screen</code>.<code class="methodname">ColorForIndex</code>(<code class="varname">icol</code>) );
    } else {
        <span class="comment">// Invert the rgb_color</span>
        <code class="methodname">SetHighColor</code>( ~<code class="varname">rcol</code>.<code class="varname">red</code>, ~<code class="varname">rcol</code>.<code class="varname">green</code>, ~<code class="varname">rcol</code>.<code class="varname">blue</code> );
    }

    <code class="methodname">FillRect</code>( <code class="varname">area</code> );

    <span class="comment">// The screen variable is destroyed, and its display</span>
    <span class="comment">// released and allowed to change again, when this</span>
    <span class="comment">// function returns.</span>
}
</pre><p>
If the screen is currently in 8-bit mode, the inversion calculation is
done using indexed colors. This is not strictly necessary—inverting
the rgb_color would provide visually acceptable results—but this is a
good example of how to manipulate color indexes.
</p><p>
Otherwise, if the screen is not in 8-bit-mode, the screen must be in a
direct mode, and we'll calculate the inverse directly from the color's
individual components. Finally, the rect is filled in, and the desktop
color's inverse is on screen.
</p><p>
A somewhat more advanced usage of <code class="classname">BScreen</code> (snipped from the Connect
source code):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">Border</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>( <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">m</code>)
{
    <span class="type">constcolor_map *</span><code class="varname">cm</code> = <code class="classname">BScreen</code>( <code class="methodname">Window</code>( )).<code class="methodname">ColorMap</code>( );
    if (<code class="parameter">m</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code> &lt; sizeof(<code class="varname">cm</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">color_list</code>)/
        sizeof(<code class="varname">cm</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">color_list</code>[0])) {
        <code class="methodname">SetViewColor</code>( <code class="varname">cm</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">color_list</code>[<code class="parameter">m</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code>]);
        <code class="methodname">Invalidate</code>( );
    }
}
</pre><p>
First, notice that the <code class="classname">BScreen</code> object is anonymous—it was never given
a name. The rules of construction and destruction still apply, so the
<code class="classname">BScreen</code> will not be destroyed until the flow of execution leaves the
enclosing brackets; in this case, when the function returns. Even in the
worst case, <code class="classname">Border</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code> takes a tiny amount of time to
execute, so this is acceptable. The variable cm will go out of scope when
the <code class="classname">BScreen</code> is destroyed, so its validity is ensured for the duration of
the function.
</p><p>
The conditional makes sure that the index <code class="code"><code class="varname">m</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code></code> falls within the bounds
of the color table. Then, using a simple table lookup (instead of the
slightly more expensive <code class="methodname">ColorForIndex</code> call), the appropriate <span class="type">rgb_color</span> is
passed to <code class="methodname">SetViewColor</code>. Simple, straightforward, and there is no chance
that the color table will change or disappear until the function returns.
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BScreen</code> is not meant to be used to lock the screen (though it can
certainly be misused to do that for now). A more sensible way to allow
applications to directly and asynchronously modify screen bits (i.e. DMA)
is in development.
</p><p>
Do you remember get_screen_info and friends from the DR8 InterfaceDefs.h?
They're still there in the Advanced Access DR9, but they are tiny little
functions implemented using <code class="classname">BScreen</code>s. They will go away in the full DR9
release. Use the old API at your peril.
</p><p>
So, yes, with <code class="classname">BScreen</code> I've added a tiny bit of lankiness to the DR9 BeOS.
Lanky not because it's hard to use (at least, I sure tried to make it
simple), but because significant parts of it are not used today. However,
just as a dog's legs eventually grow to fit its paws, the BeOS will grow
to fit its header files, and the result will be lean, fast, and powerful.

You may have heard that DR9 adopts the Unicode Standard for encoding
characters and, in particular, the UTF-8 transformation of Unicode
character values. You can read all about UTF-8 in "The Unicode Standard,
Version 2.0" published by Addison-Wesley, but here's a synopsis for those
of you that don't have the book.
</p><p>
Unicode is a universal encoding scheme for all the characters in the
major scripts of the world—including, among others, extended Latin,
Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagiri, Telugu, Hebrew, Arabic, Tibetan, and the
various character sets used by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It assigns
a unique and unambiguous 16-bit value to each character, making it
possible for characters from various languages to co-exist in the same
document. Unicode makes it simpler to write language-aware software
(though it doesn't solve all the problems). It also makes a wide variety
of symbols available to an application even if it's not concerned with
internationalization.
</p><p>
Unicode's one disadvantage is that all characters have a width of 16
bits. Although 16 bits are necessary for a universal encoding and a fixed
width is important for the standard, there are many contexts in which
byte-sized characters would be easier to work with and take up less
memory (besides being more familiar and backwards compatible with
existing code). UTF-8 is designed to address this problem.
</p><p>
UTF-8 stands for "UCS Transformation Format, 8-bit form" (and UCS stands
for "Universal Multiple-Octet Character Set," another name for Unicode).
UTF-8 transforms 16-bit Unicode values into a variable number of 8-bit
units. It takes advantage of the fact that for values less than 0x0080,
the Unicode character set matches the 7-bit ASCII character set—in
other words, Unicode adopts the ASCII standard, but encodes each
character in 16 bits. UTF-8 strips ASCII values back to 8 bits and uses
two or three bytes to encode Unicode values over 0x007f.
</p><p>
The high bit of each UTF-8 byte indicates the role it plays in the
encoding: If the high bit is 0, the byte stands alone and encodes an
ASCII value. If the high bit is 1, the byte is part of a multiple-byte
character representation.
</p><p>
In addition, the first byte of a multibyte character indicates how many
bytes it takes to represent the character: The number of high bits that
are set to 1 (before a bit is 0) is the number of bytes in the encoding.
Therefore, the first byte of a multibyte character will always have at
least two high bits set. The other bytes in a multibyte encoding have
just one high bit set.
</p><p>
To illustrate, here is how UTF-8 arranges the bits in one-, two-, and
three-byte encodings (where a '0' or '1' indicates a control bit
specified by the standard and an 'x' is a bit that contributes to the
character value):
</p><pre class="screen">
1:    0 x x x x x x x

2:    1 1 0 x x x x x   1 0 x x x x x x

3:    1 1 1 0 x x x x   1 0 x x x x x x   1 0 x x x x x x
</pre><p>
Note that any 16-bit value can be encoded in three UTF-8 bytes. However,
UTF-8 discards leading zeroes and always uses the fewest possible number
of bytes, so it can encode Unicode values less than 0x0080 in a single
byte and values less than 0x0800 in two bytes.
</p><p>
In addition to the codings illustrated above, UTF-8 takes four bytes to
translate a Unicode "surrogate pair"—two conjoined 16-bit values that
together encode a character that's not part of the standard. Surrogates
are extremely rare. See "The Unicode Standard" for details.
</p><p>
The UTF-8 encoding scheme has several advantages:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The single byte that encodes an ASCII value can't be confused with a
byte that's part of a multiple-byte encoding. You can test a UTF-8 byte
for an ASCII value without considering its context; if there's a match,
you can be sure the byte is the ASCII character. UTF-8 is fully
compatible with ASCII.
</p></li><li><p>
The first (or only) byte of a character can't be confused with a byte
inside a multibyte sequence. It's simple to find where a character
begins. For example, this macro does the job:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#define BEGINS_CHAR(<code class="parameter">byte</code>) ((<code class="parameter">byte</code> &amp; 0xc0) != 0x80)
</pre></li><li><p>
The string functions in the standard C library—such as,
<code class="function">strcasecmp()</code>, <code class="function">strcat()</code>,
and <code class="function">strlen()</code>—can operate on a UTF-8 string.
</p><p>
However, it's important to remember that <code class="function">strlen()</code> measures the string
in bytes, not characters. Some Interface Kit functions, like
<code class="methodname">GetEscapements()</code> in the <code class="classname">BFont</code> class, ask for a character count;
<code class="function">strlen()</code> can't provide the answer. Instead, you need to do something
like this to count the characters in a UTF-8 string:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">count</code> = 0;
while ( *<code class="varname">p</code> != '\0' ) {
    if ( BEGINS_CHAR(*<code class="varname">p</code>) )
        <code class="varname">count</code>++;
    <code class="varname">p</code>++;
}
</pre></li><li><p>
Also, you should be careful when using the string comparison functions
to order a set of strings. Unicode tries to be a universal encoding and
orders characters in a way that's generically correct. However, it may
not be correct for specific characters for specific languages. (Because
it follows ASCII, UTF-8 is correct for English.)
</p></li><li><p>
For European languages, UTF-8 generally yields more compact data
representations than would Unicode. Most of the characters in a string
can be encoded in a single byte. In many other cases, UTF-8 is no less
compact than Unicode.
</p></li></ul><p>
The BeOS assumes UTF-8 encoding in most cases. For example, a <code class="constant">B_KEY_DOWN</code>
message reports the character that's mapped to the key the user pressed
as a UTF-8 value. The message has a data array named "byte" with each
byte of the encoding as a separate item. The bytes are extracted from the
array and passed as a string to the new version of <code class="methodname">KeyDown()</code>, along with
the byte count:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
virtual <span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">KeyDown</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">bytes</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">numBytes</code>);
</pre><p>
You can expect the "bytes" string to always contain at least one byte.
And, of course, you can test it for any ASCII value without caring that
it's UTF-8:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
if ( <code class="varname">bytes</code>[0] == <code class="constant">B_TAB</code> )
    . . .
</pre><p>
Similarly, BeOS objects that display text in the user interface—such
as window titles and button labels—expect to be passed UTF-8 encoded
strings, and will pass you a UTF-8 string if you ask for the title or
label.

Although the <code class="classname">BFont</code> class allows other encodings, which you may need to
use from time to time, the system fonts are stuck with UTF-8. It's
recommended that you stick with it as well wherever possible.

What kind of programmer are you? That's what I ask myself on a regular
basis. Am I motivated by fame, fortune, prestige, or something like a
desire to change the world?
</p><p>
Well, honestly, it's a combination of all of these. I've done the mission
critical custom app thing to great success, and now I've moved on to more
interesting things. When I program the BeOS, I'm excited. I mean really.
Staying up until 4am for that "one more compile" just so you can see
picture in picture video running on a standard BeOS machine?
</p><p>
Well, that's what I did this weekend.

I don't watch TV that much, but when a TV tuner/video capture card costs
only $127 at Fry's, how could I possibly resist. The interesting thing
about the Hauppauge board is that it has a tuner, and composite video
inputs. You can switch between them on the fly. With two of these boards
in your machine, you basically have 4 video input sources. This is better
than my TV at home, and costs a lot less. I'm telling you, if you haven't
already gone out and bought one of these capture cards yet, now would be
a good time.
</p><p>
The other interesting thing about the Hauppauge board is that it works
better at full screen rather than smaller. Why is that? DMA my fine
fellow, DMA. The Hauppauge board, or more accurately the Brooktree Bt848
video capture chip, does DMA transfers directly into video memory if you
tell it to. So full screen 60 fields per second 32 bit color looks pretty
cool, and you don't need high energy machines to achieve this
performance. When you display at a smaller scale, the Bt848 has to do
some scaling. This doesn't really slow it down, but the quality isn't as
good. The beauty of DMA is that the CPU doesn't really get involved. A
lowly PowerPC 603 66MHz could do the job.
</p><p>
The thing that keeps me programming is the leap frog inspiration that
really cool technology causes. Once you have one of these capture cards,
you might think of ways to improve your "entertainment system." You might
add easy access to the web and TV Guide, or you might find it interesting
to add control of your FireWire-based VCR and CD players. Whatever your
motivation, there's nothing like getting all excited about driving a
tractor all over the apps that other poor farmers are still struggling
with.
</p><p>
Judging from our mail and BeDevTalk postings, you're all very active with
DR9. We're pumping out sample apps as fast as we can, and working on
documentation. Keep sending us your input as to how we can better serve
you. Without your efforts, this platform will be a technology looking for
a solution. Keep up the good work and keep sending in that valuable
praise and criticism. We in turn will continue to try and provide you
with the best platform upon which you can dream up your killer apps.

I spent a week in the old country, meeting software developers, investors
and business partners, mostly from France, but also from other parts of
Europe. We've invested early in Europe, based on a combination of beliefs
and connections. The connections relate to my checkered past in the
computer industry over there. I worked in the French as well as the
European HQ of my alma mater Hewlett-Packard, at Data General, at Exxon
Office Systems (briefly, quickly recognizing the error) and starting
Apple France, before fulfilling an old dream and moving to the Silicon
Valley. As a result, when we started the company, we benefited from a
hospitable European network. Friends invested in the company and
introduced us to other investors; we abducted people to California and
linked up again with associates from earlier lives.
</p><p>
In many respects, the company probably wouldn't be around if it weren't
for our European connections. In 1991, when we started raising money, US
investors were understandably reluctant. Microsoft was already perceived
as the invincible juggernaut—the agility came later when they became a
born-again Internet company. At the time, PDAs, set-top boxes and 3DO
game consoles were in fashion and we couldn't quite demonstrate our OS
side by side with older platforms. The "no legacy, no baggage" equation
was hard to explain.
</p><p>
In so called "high-tech" industries, Europe is perceived as having fallen
behind the US. In several instances, it is even true as in the case of
the PC business. Companies such as Olivetti or Nixdorf were once industry
leaders. Their misfortunes haven't dulled European appetites for new
technology. In many respects "conservative" Europeans are more daring
than New World players. VCRs, CDs and, more recently, the Macintosh and
digital cellular telephones enjoyed a better early acceptance in the old
continent than in the US. (Once the new standards get accepted in the US,
the market quickly makes up for a late start.)
</p><p>
In Be's case, our unconventional proposition found early takers in
Europe. Some investors were not awed by the Microsoft "Über alles"
mystique, others saw in us the Silicon Valley connection. One of them
told us bluntly he'd "never invest in a deal like this based in Europe"...
</p><p>
European developers react in a similar fashion. First, in an apparent
paradox, just like the blunt investor, many local developers would be
reluctant to bet their time and energy on a European media OS. And,
second, our evangelism efforts got "traction" earlier in Europe than in
the US. Does it mean the famous "tractor app" will come from Europe
rather than the US? It is still too early to tell, but we see another
positive factor in our European connection. It is even harder to make
money in the software business in Europe than it is in the US. As a
result of our use of the Net to market and deliver software, European
developers see the BeOS as a way to break into the US market unavailable
with the conventional distribution network. Our goal is to make their
hopes come true.
