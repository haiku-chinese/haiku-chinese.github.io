Some days, I wish I were a user interface or graphics guy. Not that life
as a kernel engineer at Be is uninteresting; far from it. But the kernel,
sitting behind the scenes, isn't as sexy as something users interact with
on a daily basis, or something that onlookers drool over during
demonstrations. It's the fancy, colorful demos of Pierre and Benoit, the
whizziness of the Tracker and interface widgets that get the "ooh, ahh",
"come on baby" attention.
</p><p>
But the feelings of jealousy don't last long. My brief forays into
non-command line applications have been satisfying to a point, but the
incessant attention to aesthetics leaves me exhausted. In the end, I'm
more than happy to get back to working on the nuts and bolts of the
system.
</p><p>
Well, more than just nuts and bolts. There's also some "glue" that's
fundamental to the BeOS system. Many of you may have noticed the
existence of a "glue" library living in
<code class="filename">/boot/develop/lib</code> on your system.
This glue library (either
<code class="filename">libglue.a</code>,
<code class="filename">glue.a</code>,
<code class="filename">libglue-noinit.a</code>,
depending on which version of the BeOS you have) is independently linked
into every application or library on the system.
</p><p>
So, what's in this glue code? Essentially, it contains routines used
during the startup and tear down of each loadable segment of an address
space.
</p><p>
Let's visualize a typical address space:
</p><pre class="screen">
HIGH +---------------------------------+
     |           libn.so               | Other libraries
     +---------------------------------+
     |              .                  |
     |              .                  |
     |              .                  |
     |                                 |
     +---------------------------------+
     |           libbe.so              | Be kits
     +---------------------------------+
     |                                 |
     |          libroot.so             | C library, core
     |                                 | functionality
     +---------------------------------+
     |                                 |
     |          application            |
     |                                 |
 LOW +---------------------------------+
</pre><p>
Each element or box of this address space is known as a "container,"
since it is self-contained. The containers of this address space are
loaded and initialized in some order at startup. Since each container has
its own data, etc., each container needs its own "glue" that contains an
initialization routine (and termination routine, during address space
tear down or unloading).
</p><p>
For applications and libraries written purely in C, there really isn't
much initialization necessary; the glue code for applications just
contains the official starting routine of the application
(<code class="code">__start</code>), sets
up some basic data structures, and then jumps to <code class="function">main()</code>.
</p><p>
For C++ applications and class libraries, however, the situation is more
complex. There may be static C++ objects which need construction at
startup and destruction at tear down, before the application starts. In
addition, each container needs to register itself as a possible place
where C++ exceptions can occur. Both of these must obviously be
per-container, and therefore live in the glue library.
</p><p>
At startup, then, the sequence carried out by the glue code for each
container is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
STARTUP/LOADING

  if application container
     set up basic data structures and hooks
  register exception tables
  construct C++ objects, if any
  jump to main()

TEAR DOWN/UNLOADING

  destroy C++ objects, if any
  unregister exception tables
</pre><p>
This may not deliver the visual excitement of a three-dimensional book
with real pages that contain movies and images, but what the heck --
Pierre's better at that stuff anyway.

You just noticed it's 4 AM, even though there's a clock right there in
the corner of the screen. Last time you looked it was something like 1
AM, but you're not really sure. It doesn't seem like four. You're not
really tired. In fact, you're just starting to feel that second wind
coming on. It's finally working now, but you're not finished. Just one
more little tweak and a build shouldn't take more than five minutes,
right? Yeah, right! ;-)

</p><p>
And now back to our regularly scheduled program.
</p><p>
This week my so-late-yer-an-early bird sermon is about timing. Just
because you have no concept of time doesn't mean your app doesn't need
to. That's why our engineers are hard at work on the next Media Kit.
Things like video, audio, and
<acronym class="acronym" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</acronym>
need to be synchronizable with each other. The code this
<acronym class="acronym" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
leads to should whet your appetite for some
seriously geeky timing work:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media_kit/obsolete/timecodeticker.zip
</p><p>
The first thing you need in order to do synchronization is something that
gives you regularly timed ticks. How often do you need these ticks? Well,
if you'd like to do full motion video it'll be around 30 times a second.
That's every 33,333 microseconds. Fortunately the BeOS has timing
resolution down to the microsecond, so you don't have to round off those
extra 333. That doesn't mean it's always accurate to the microsecond, but
you can always tell how far off you are. ;-)
</p><p>
Most of the time, you can be sure to be "woken-up" within 2000
microseconds of the time you wanted. That's less than 7% of one frame.
More often than not, it's more like 2 or 3%, and we're working hard on
improving that accuracy!
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">ticker</code> class compensates for the inaccuracy that exists from sample
to sample, a.k.a. jitter, so that it doesn't compound into drift over
time. It's derived from William Adams' nice <code class="classname">Thread</code> class (available from
BeWare in the bebits package ):
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/libraries/bebits980105.zip
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">ticker</code> class outputs ticks. Each tick has information about the
number it is in a series, the time it was generated, the period of its
generation and sometimes, a timecode. There is also a <code class="classname">timecode</code> class.
This is a stripped down version of one that Steve Sakoman has put
together that includes every standard frame rate including the hard to
come by Brazilian PAL rates (unless of course you're in Brazil ;-) He's
not quite done with it, though, so I yanked out the part that does plain
old 30 frames per second and put that in the sample, so you could have a
taste. Yum.
</p><p>
Where do these ticks go when the <code class="classname">ticker</code> ticks?
The <code class="classname">ticker</code> maintains a
list of ports that is managed by a couple of obvious enough functions:
<code class="methodname">Connect()</code> and <code class="methodname">Disconnect()</code>.
When it comes time to tick, the <code class="classname">ticker</code> sends
a <code class="constant">TICK_MSG</code> along with a tick object to all connected ports.
</p><p>
On the other end of the port is another object derived from William's
thread, the <code class="classname">Chaser</code>. A chaser can be passed a function that it calls each
time it receives a tick. In that function, you can play audio, MIDI
video, whatever. To keep this sample uncluttered, I just display the
current frame count in the app's window. No, it's NOT very exciting
(unless it's four in the morning, and you wrote it), but it does
demonstrate the concept. ;-)
</p><p>
As an exercise for the reader, try yanking out the <code class="classname">TCIn</code> class and the
chaser class and sticking them in another app. Then send a message from
the chaser app to the ticker app with the <span class="type">port_id</span> of the chaser. We use
<span class="type">port_id</span>s so we can have chasers in different apps all listening to the
same ticker. Next time I'll show you how multiple apps can be
synchronized properly, and maybe I'll even make some noise. Woohoo!
</p><p>
See you early!

Recently a Micro Center super store opened in Silicon Valley. It's huge
and sells literally everything. There are computers for maybe $10,
keyboards, motherboards, mice, furniture, books, software, magazines,
mousepads, green and white printer paper with perforated edges, you name
it...huge.
</p><p>
I was in this huge store looking around for a certain game I had been
commanded to buy for a certain 12-year-old and I got to thinking.
(Uh-oh.) I've noticed that if you go to any computer or bookstore you see
so many computer books and magazines. Aisles. Shelves. Windows. Unix.
Linux.
</p><p>
But...there's no BeOS section yet. No BeOS software, no BeOS books (there
aren't many yet). The BeOS has been seen as a sort of Mac add-on, but
it's about to become a name in its own right, in that vast Intel world.
</p><p>
Am I getting through? Yes, it's about to hit the fan. BeOS for Intel will
be available very soon, and the world of Be developers is going to change
dramatically. We're taking steps to publicize the Intel version of the
BeOS. It's innovative, exciting, fast, interesting and NEW—and all of
these factors combined with the sheer size of the Intel marketplace will
translate into commercial opportunities for the experienced BeOS
developer community.
</p><p>
To give you some idea of the reach of Intel, I just read that the Mac
currently has 3.1% of the computer market. That means that BeOS is about
to enter the marketplace that holds that other 96.9%. There will be
bookshelves, and software shelves, and magazines waiting to be filled
with BeOS books, software, and information.
</p><p>
There's a train rolling and we want you to be on it. We're already
hearing from software publishers who are looking for BeOS applications
and programmers. We're hearing from book publishers looking for authors.
Technical magazines will need informational articles.
</p><p>
You—the existing BeOS developer community—are the knowledge base
that software companies, book publishers, and magazine editors are going
to look to for information.
</p><p>
And now, some suggestions to help you get ready to take advantage of the
coming bonanza:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Important: Update your developer info in our database by visiting the
registered developer section of our web site.
</p></li><li><p>
Get some software up onto BeWare. Publishers are looking there for
promising products.
</p></li><li><p>
If you have software up on BeWare, please visit the web site and make
sure your information is correct and current.
</p></li><li><p>
If you are a programmer available for a contract or employment let
software publishers know about you by placing a classified ad in this
newsletter. Send your ad to Valerie Peyre at valerie@be.com.
</p></li><li><p>
In addition, we are setting up a database of available BeOS
programmers. I can't give you a URL yet, but watch the web page and
developer e-mail—it will be available soon.
</p></li><li><p>
Think about topics for informational articles and start contacting
the magazines to let them know you're available to write these articles.
</p></li><li><p>
Think about interesting topics for books and start your book proposal.
</p></li></ul><p>
Finally, if you are thinking about entering the market with a product or
you were working on a product when the bottom dropped out of the Mac
market, remember this: 3.1% vs 96.9%.

Last week, Netscape made important news. One of the items involved the
public release of Navigator source code. This was well received as a
smart move, a good reaction to the situation created by the availability
of the free Internet Explorer, bundled with Windows or not.
</p><p>
The reasoning is that since Netscape is forced to give away the browser,
they might as well release the sources. In doing so, Netscape gets an
immediate shot of goodwill. Over the longer term—the theory being
there are many more smart people not working at Netscape than inside --
to quote Jim Barksdale, smart programmers will improve the browser in a
myriad of creative, unforeseeable ways that will benefit users, Netscape
and the industry in general.
</p><p>
This led an honorable correspondent to write and ask whether or not we
would do the same for the BeOS and, in some way, make it the "people's
OS." Interesting question, one we've actually asked ourselves several
times over the life of our little company. In the end, there must be a
simple answer, but it's still a complicated question.
</p><p>
Let's take the case of Navigator. Releasing the sources sounds simple,
put the source tree up on the Web site and that's it. In reality, it is
safe to assume there is licensed code inside Navigator, bits Netscape got
from someone else and isn't at liberty to put in the public domain. This
might explain why the public release isn't immediate and poses the
problem of how functional the released product will be. Once this is
done, we have to assume several competing versions will emerge after a
while, a situation similar to the one we have with several public and
proprietary versions of Unix.
</p><p>
In other words, balkanization, the fragmentation of the product in many
different versions, seems to be the price to pay for the legion of
independent improvements. With the versions of Unix, technically
proficient users were willing to take the source code of an application,
modify it, and recompile it for their version of the operating system.
</p><p>
With the Web, however, the situation might be different. The browser runs
programs (or interprets HTML statements) over which it doesn't have the
control Unix users had over their code. This constraint might actually
limit the multigenerational mutations introduced by many independent
versions, it might help some sites experiment with dialects of HTML while
still reading whatever the "mainstream" dialect happens to be at the
moment.
</p><p>
As we know from history, a single monolithic standard always becomes
overly conservative, and we could all benefit from innovations introduced
by "nonstandard" versions. Or things could get very messy. Personally, I
don't believe so; the market will deal harshly with the really bad code.
One might even be able to make money within such a context.
</p><p>
Let's say you set up a site for games played over the Web. You might
improve the experience and, therefore, your profits, by enhancing
responsiveness or other characteristics of the playing experience. You
could do so by writing plug-ins for the dominant, integrated browser, or
you might feel constrained by that environment and "offer" (terms of
bundling to be determined) a modified browser you've crafted under your
total control, based on the public domain sources from Netscape. It's an
application; it will run beside, on top, or instead of the integrated
browser; and, if it's compelling, it will make you money one way or the
other as more people will pay for better gaming.
</p><p>
Back to reality, there might be more than one flavor of the Navigator
sources, perhaps Windows, X-Windows, and Macintosh, and we don't know how
this will play out and complicate things. In any case, it will be fun to
watch what actually happens.
</p><p>
As for releasing the BeOS sources, not at this time. We need to advance
the cause of BeOS developers, BeOS users and, as a result, Be
shareholders. Keeping the Unix experience in mind, as well as our PC
hardware target, we don't see how the problems created by balkanizing the
BeOS platform would be outweighed by the many improvements independent
programmers would, without a doubt, introduce in our product. I wish we
could get the latter without the former and I know from experience how
someone walking in on a project "sees" things one has stopped seeing
after many months or years of work.
</p><p>
For the time being, we'll have to live by the "vigorous" feedback of
developers and users and, perhaps, a few ideas of our own, or from our
noble and worthy elders.

Let's say you want to launch an app just after you boot but before any
other apps—including the <span class="application">Tracker</span>—get into the act. You can achieve
this sort of behaviour by modifying the system <code class="filename">Bootscript</code>—but is it a
good idea?
</p><p>
A chorus of disapproval hummed the Dies Irae: Touch <code class="filename">Bootscript</code> and you'll
be sorry. Lacrymosa Dies Illa. But see THE BE LINE, below.
</p><p>
The thread led to a discussion of the untouchableness of
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/etc</code>.
As Peter Morgensen pointed out...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The fact that
<code class="filename">/etc</code> is linked to
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/etc</code>
makes <code class="filename">/etc</code> useless for
ports of POSIX apps. A lot of major POSIX apps have
<code class="filename">/etc</code> as the default
place for config files.</span>”
</p><p>
Dominic Giampaolo administered triage:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If you want install a Unix app that needs to put things into an "etc"
directory then feel free to put it in
<code class="filename">~/config/etc</code> which is equivalent to
<code class="filename">/usr/local/etc</code> on a unix system.</span>”
</p><p>
Back in the thick of it, Sean Gies beat the installation
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bete noir</em></span> with a
stick:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I'm a big fan of self-contained applications. I hate it when I install
something and it decides to spread itself across my file system. It would
be nice to know that everything for my <span class="application">FooBar</span> App is in that single
<code class="filename">FooBar</code> folder and not in 3
different system folders as well. I'd hate to
see BeOS to turn into the clutter that Windows and Unix have become.</span>”
</p><p>
In response, Osma Ahvenlampi injected a call for libprefs. With
reasonable preferences management (i.e. something more controlled than
saving settings in a file) file system clutter is minimized, the
developer's job is made clearer, and (multi)users have an easier time
setting preferences and uninstalling apps.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: You can modify <code class="filename">Bootscript</code> on your own machine, but don't
expect to publish anything that depends on it. As many listeners
suggested, the only "official" approach is to petition Be to include a
<code class="filename">Bootscript</code> hook.

C++ shop talk. Multiple inheritance appears to stack the deck in favor of
the first of the set of inherited-from classes (this is sort of a side-
effect of the way the class components are offset, but that's not the
issue). Because of this, the Be Book edict that a subclass implementation
of <code class="classname">BArchivable</code>'s <code class="methodname">Instantiate()</code>
should cast its return as an instance of
the subclass is, according to Duncan Wilcox, misguided:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I think the fix is that every <code class="methodname">Instantiate()</code> should always return a
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BArchivable</code>*</span>, I don't really
understand why it was designed to return a
pointer to an instance of its class.</span>”
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: (From Peter Potrebic) Duncan is correct. We will update the
documentation. All <code class="methodname">Instantiate()</code> implementations should be declared to
return a <span class="type"><code class="classname">BArchivable</code>*</span>.

Does Be Samba? The Session Message Block (SAMBA) protocol lets Windows
talk to Linux—or at least lets them share disks and printers. Or
something. Does Be or a third party want to get into this rhumba? Some
feints, and then this cold water from Chris Herborth:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Samba assumes you're on a UNIX system, where a file descriptor == a
socket; this isn't true on BeOS (or Win32, for that matter), so you'll
end up re-writing a lot of code.</span>”
</p><p>
Not much else, here, except for the demon case-sensitivity which sat
grumbling in the corner (how did we get there?). Dominic Giampaolo made
an effort to staunch the flow with this reasoned summation (further
reduced by the editor):
</p><p>
“When you're using a file open dialog box, the case sensitiveness of the
file system doesn't matter because you're clicking on the file name...
Case sensitiveness matters most when [you're trying to find a file in a
Find panel and you] don't remember the exact case of a filename... We've
made the Tracker's Find panel generate case-insensitive queries so that
way it doesn't matter if you don't remember the name correctly.
</p><p>
This seems to be a best of all worlds. People clicking on file names
don't care about case, people that can't remember a name don't have to
remember the case, and shell users get the expected case- sensitive
behavior.”
</p><p>
What about internationalization? Is Be preparing for the Spanish language
version that will treat "ll" as a single character?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We want to do internationalization righter than sooner. It's
a complicated problem begging for a simple solution. And so on.

So what is this thing we call the Desktop (ask Sean Gies)? And why are
entities from different volumes allowed to live on it at the same time?
It's disturbing (continues Mr. Gies) to unmount a floppy and see a bunch
of file icons disappear from the Desktop.
</p><p>
Disturbing? It's the way computers should work, says Jeff A. Campbell:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">A desktop is for commonly used items. Maybe my commonly used items span
more than one disk...</span>”
</p><p>
However, Mr. Campbell suggested that the Desktop should be a bit more
virtual—it shouldn't be a literal directory. As it is, the Desktop is
more amenable to links than to plain files; and creating a link to a file
just so you can refer to it from the Desktop is a pain.

A question from Josh J. Berdine:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Is there a good way to differentiate add-ons and applications from the
shell or mime types or whatever?</span>”
</p><p>
Many listeners wrote in with the bad (for Mr. Berdine) news: Nope. The
MIME types (and all other scars and birthmarks) are the same. An add-on
can act as an application can act as a library. Most of our listeners
applaud the amorphism. Slap Replicants onto this ball of mud and things
become even more approbatorially indistinct:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...there is no really clear technical distinction, because with
Replicants, any application may be loaded as an add-on to another
application. It's more a convenience of naming than a technical
specification.</span>” (Jon Watte)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id660302"></a>Subject: multiple threads for blitting</h4></div></div></div><p>
A question from Steve LaVietes:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Would the overhead of spawning multiple threads to simultaneously use
DrawBitmap on divisions of the total area [of a view] be greater than
using just one call?</span>”
</p><p>
Marco Nelissen responded, reasonably:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...those calls to <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code> will effectively be serialized, each
thread waiting for the other to complete. You simply can't have two
threads drawing into a window at the same time. You might gain something
by using <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code>, which won't wait for the app_server to finish
the blit.</span>”
</p><p>
Mr. LaVietes mentioned that he was <span class="type">double</span> buffering through a Bitmap. Jon
Watte suggested that this might not be necessary:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...<span class="type">double</span>-buffering might be SLOWER than just drawing the stuff you want
to draw. Modern graphics card can fill rectangles and draw straight lines
much faster than the time it takes to transfer the equivalent bits from
memory.</span>”
</p><p>
But what about the flicker factor? Mr. LaVietes:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Assuming that a large window needed to be completely drawn over without
flicker, what other idea [besides <span class="type">double</span> buffering] would you have?</span>”
</p><p>
Mr. Watte's response:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The trick is to ... not clobber an entire area with white and then start
filling it in. If you're moving a rectangle, you should draw the
rectangle at the new place, then draw whatever was underneath the
rectangle in the old place.</span>”
</p><p>
Back to asynchronous drawing, Chris Herborth observed that...
</p><p>
“While working on DOOM, I found out that:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>( ... );
<code class="methodname">Sync</code>();
</pre><p>
was faster than:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap</code>( ... );
</pre><p>
Strange but true.”
