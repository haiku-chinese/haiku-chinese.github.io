The Be OS is composed of a boot ROM, a kernel, several 'servers,' and a
shared library that exports the Be API. If you issue a ps command in the
Terminal window, you will see that many of these components have several
threads. This article describes all these items, how they get started,
and what they do.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471078"></a>The Boot ROM</h3></div></div></div><p>
The flash memory device on the motherboard contains the boot ROM. It's
partitioned into sections, including a small "nub" and a main part.
</p><p>
When you turn on the BeBox, CPU 0 starts running in the nub, while CPU 1
is held in reset. The nub's job is to locate, size, test, and configure
the memory, check the floppy drive for a special Boot ROM Upgrader disk,
and then pass control to the main part of the boot ROM.
</p><p>
The main part of the boot ROM has the single-minded task of locating a
kernel on one of the disks attached to the BeBox. It searches in a
particular order: Floppy, removable disks (such as CD-ROM drives or
removable hard disks), the disk specified by the boot preference (set by
the Installer or the boot command), SCSI fixed disks (scanning from SCSI
ID 0 to 6), and IDE disks (master first, then slave). If a kernel is
found, it's loaded and run.
</p><p>
Before CPU 0 rummages around for a kernel, it releases CPU 1 from reset.
CPU 1 quickly jumps from the nub to the main part, and displays the
swirling Be logo. CPU 1 then idles until CPU 0 is in the kernel and ready
to run with both CPUs going full bore.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471119"></a>The Kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>
The kernel is started by CPU 0. It sets up all the basic necessities
(semaphores, threads, teams, the scheduler, areas, ports, interrupts,
inter-CPU communication, virtual memory, idle threads), and then lets CPU
1 join the party. Either CPU can run any thread from the ready queue, so
multiprocessing just happens naturally when the code is structured into
separate threads.
</p><p>
The kernel starts up several internal housekeeping threads:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term">idle threads 0 and 1:</span></p></td><td><p>
Each CPU must always run something. The idle
threads are simple spin loops, with a scheduling priority of zero. They
never block, so they're always around when there's nothing else to do.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">psycho-killer:</span></p></td><td><p>
Having a thread kill itself is tricky. It's much easier to
hire out for the job. The psycho_killer thread assassinates threads that
wish to die, and removes a team when the team's threads have all died.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">idle debug 0 and 1:</span></p></td><td><p>
These are around in case something bad happens in the
idle threads. They take over debugging chores from the idle threads, thus
allowing the idle threads to continue loafing on the street corner.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">dprintf and dgets:</span></p></td><td><p>
These are for kernel debugging. If you hold down the
F1 key when you boot, all sorts of debugging spewage comes out of serial
port 4 at 19.2 kilobaud. Should the kernel crash, a primitive debugger is
available there. These two threads manage the debugging I/O to the serial
port.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">floppy motor off:</span></p></td><td><p>
A floppy drive takes half a second to spin up to speed.
Rather than turning the motor off after each read or write, it's left
running for a few seconds in case another access comes along. This thread
turns the motor off after this grace period.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">disk cache:</span></p></td><td><p>
The file system has a cache. This thread periodically writes
dirty sectors from the cache to disk. Note that disk accesses greater
than a certain size bypass the cache entirely.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Once these niceties are set up, the kernel mounts all available disks and
looks for a disk from which to boot the rest of the system. Disks are
examined to see if they have a complete set of system software: the
Browser, the Application Server, the Storage Server, the Zoo Keeper, a
drivers directory, and the shared libraries
<code class="filename">libbe.so</code> and <code class="filename">libpos.so</code>. If
any of these files are on the floppy, they take priority over these files
on other disks.
</p><p>
The kernel looks for system files on disks in the following order: The
floppy disk, the volume where the kernel was found by the boot ROM, the
disk specified by the boot preference, SCSI disks 0-6, IDE master, and
IDE slave. The first disk with all the system files, minus any
contributions from the floppy, becomes the "boot volume." If the boot
volume is writable, it's also used as the volume where the virtual memory
backing files are kept; otherwise, virtual memory is disabled.
</p><p>
Once the boot volume is identified, the Application Server, Storage
Server, Zoo Keeper, and the Browser are started from the boot volume (or
the floppy). Additionally, the kernel looks for a file called Bootscript,
and starts up a shell to interpret it. The current Bootscript launches
the ANSI Server, the Audio Server, the Debug Server, the Name Server, the
Net Server and ftpd.

The <code class="filename">libbe.so</code> shared library exports the API described in The Be Book.
Applications link with the shared library at compile time, and are bound
to the shared library when they are loaded at runtime.
</p><p>
The shared library together with the various servers implement the API.
The library uses the kernel's port mechanism and shared memory to
communicate with the servers. API calls are converted into messages and
sent though a port to a thread in the appropriate server. Servers usually
allocate a single thread to manage each client, allowing for concurrent
access to the functionality each server provides. The allocated thread
receives the message, carries out the call, and often returns results to
the client via another port.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471301"></a>The Shared Library: libpos.so</h3></div></div></div><p>
<code class="filename">libpos.so</code> provides an emulation of some of the Posix API. This makes
porting of UNIX-flavored software much more feasible. Many of the
command-line tools available in the Terminal application use this library.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471319"></a>The Application Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Application Server, in conjunction with the Application Kit and the
Interface Kit, manages an application's user interface, graphical
environment, and messaging infrastructure. All these are extensively
documented in The Be Book.
</p><p>
The Application Server has a few permanent housekeeping threads, plus a
separate thread for each client application and each client window. The
housekeeping threads are:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term">poller:</span></p></td><td><p>
Collects keyboard and mouse information from the kernel, forwards
it to the app_server thread, and displays the on-screen cursor
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">app_server:</span></p></td><td><p>
Handles set-up of new applications; dispatches keyboard and
mouse events to the appropriate window thread, which sends them to the
client
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term">picasso:</span></p></td><td><p>
Receives notification from the kernel of various interesting
events, such as a thread being destroyed
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471387"></a>The Storage Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Storage Server is the database engine. The Storage Server manages the
index into the databases and performs the queries associated with each
database.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471401"></a>The Zoo Keeper</h3></div></div></div><p>
The functions described in "The Storage Kit" chapter in The Be Book are
actually split between the Storage Server, the Zoo Keeper, and the
libbe.so shared library. The Zoo Keeper, keeps track of volumes, ensuring
that every volume has a database that describes the volume's file system
hierarchy. The actual management of files and directories (<code class="classname">BFile</code>,
<code class="classname">BDirectory</code>, <code class="classname">BVolume</code>) is split between the shared library and the Zoo
Keeper. Both use the Storage Server to maintain the database view of the
file system. Interestingly, the Zoo Keeper and Storage Server are also
linked with the libbe.so shared library to gain access to each other, the
kernel, and the Application Server.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471434"></a>The Browser</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Browser is what you see when the machine has started up. Its powerful
capabilities are sure to be the subject of a future newsletter article.
Strictly speaking the Browser is an application like any other—it
links with the shared library and uses the various servers and the kernel
to go about its business. Obviously it's one of the more important
applications shipped with the BeBox.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471452"></a>The ANSI Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The ANSI Server is an anachronism, which will soon go away. It provides
ANSI-style terminal windows to clients, communicating through named pipes
with the client. It has been replaced by a new TTY driver, which
understands how to emulate an ANSI terminal. In earlier releases, the
shell used the ANSI Server, but it has been converted to use the TTY
driver. The Debug Server has not yet been converted, so we'll have the
ANSI Server around for a little longer.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471470"></a>The Audio Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Audio Server provides the functionality described in "The Media Kit"
chapter of The Be Book. Streams, Stream Controllers, and the Subscription
mechanism are all handled here.
</p><p>
Two housekeeping threads, DAC Feeder and ADC Feeder, keep sound buffers
flowing smoothly to and from the sound driver (which manages the audio
CODEC). Requests to play or record sounds instantiate a thread that
manages the process.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471492"></a>The Debug Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Debug Server implements the assembly-level debugger. When an
application crashes or runs into a debugger() call, the kernel spawns a
per-team debugging thread in the application's address space to manage
communication with the Debug Server. The Debug Server, in turn, spawns a
thread to put up a window for that team (currently using the ANSI Server)
and to process debugging commands. The kernel provides hooks for
installing a different debugger on a per-team basis. Our friends at
Metrowerks are creating a source-level debugger using this facility.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471504"></a>The Net Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Net Server implements the TCP/IP protocols needed to communicate with
other devices over an Ethernet or PPP connection.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471517"></a>The Name Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Name Server assists the Net Server in managing various system
resources, such as ports and semaphores.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id471529"></a>ftpd</h3></div></div></div><p>
ftpd is the ftp 'daemon.' It runs in the background, silently providing
ftp access to the BeBox.

The Be OS is divided up into many different components. Hopefully this
article has shed some light on how they are started up, and what they do.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-5"></a>MacWorld? What Are We Thinking?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
This is a Macintosh trade show. You're not selling Macs, you're not a Mac
OS licensee, the BeBox isn't even a
<acronym class="acronym" title="Common Hardware Reference Platform">CHRP</acronym> platform, and in any case, with
your "geek" positioning, you're definitely not addressing the needs of
mainstream Mac users. So, what are you doing here?
</p><p>
Good question. A few months ago, I would have agreed we had no business
going to MacWorld. And today, I agree with all the facts stated above.
But they're not relevant to our decision to exhibit in San Francisco.
Here's why, with the hope it will shed some light on our marketing
strategy. No, we're not selling Macs and we're not a Mac OS licensee
although,at some point, we considered it. Early in 1995, friends at Apple
advised us to wait for a new hardware reference platform. Eventually,
Copland would run on that platform and all compliant hardware would run
the new Mac OS. No need to be a licensee, just buy the OS off the shelf
and you can run Mac applications.
</p><p>
Indeed, the <acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym> platform was announced at Comdex, with a partial release
of technical data. Specs for the ISA system and a few other details are
expected soon and, given the updated Copland schedule, Apple announced it
will make a 7.5.x version for <acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym>, with the first machines to appear in
late 1996 or the first half of 1997, depending on the source. As the <acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym>
specs are finalized and parts vendors start supplying chip sets, making a
<acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym> compliant multiprocessor BeBox with its rich, geeky I/O becomes an
attractive proposition. As the current BeBox is based on the ancestor of
<acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym>, PREP, it's logical for Be to make <acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym> an important part of its
product strategy. Today's PC clones are still built around a core of
PC/AT design. Compliance to these specs has allowed PC buyers to benefit
from a number of operating systems: DOS, Windows and Windows NT, of
course, but also a number of UNIX variants, NEXTSTEP, Linux, OS/2, and I
must forget a few. The <acronym class="acronym">CHRP</acronym> partners hope to see a like diversity of
system software on the PowerPC side. We'll be happy to help and benefit
as the new platform gains momentum. But this is for the 1997 horizon.
</p><p>
What about MacWorld in January 1996, geeks, and mainstream Mac users?
Representing MacWorld as only attended by bourgeois mainstream users is
quite a stretch. Yes, we see more suits than T-shirts today than ten
years ago, but there's always a strong contingent of aggressive,
knowledgeable users, exhibitors, and software developers. They're not
always found around the bigger, jazzier, and more expensive booths, and
that's fine with us. They're our audience—they come to MacWorld in
sufficient numbers to more than justify our presence. Three months ago,
at the Agenda conference, we showed the BeBox to an audience of
professional cynics—or cynical pros. We were surprised by the
exceptionally warm reception. This continued as our Web site opened. We
now have more than 900 requests for development systems from all over the
world, and the new comp.sys.be newsgroup is lively. As a result of a
higher than expected level of interest, of "pull," we decided to go
beyond the "Demo Days" at Be in Menlo Park. Three months after Agenda,
MacWorld happened to be a nicely timed and geographically positioned
venue.
</p><p>
For the more committed, you decide the sense, we'll host our first
software developer conference, our first "GeekFest," right after MacWorld
on Saturday, January 13, in South San Francisco Convention Center.
</p><p>
Back to our MacWorld booth: We'll make sure mainstream users aren't
misled. We'll prominently display a surgeon general's warning: Unfit for
consumption by normal humans. We'll focus on software development tools,
the new version of CodeWarrior by Metrowerks, prototypes and works in
progress from early Be developers, and BeBox demonstrations every 20
minutes. This is our first public appearance. Come by if you can. You'll
get your free We Be Geeks pocket protector.

Here are a few answers to a number of the most common questions you've
been asking about Be. We'll keep you informed regularly about Be
marketing, sales, pricing, and the like.You can also check out our web
site at: http://www.be.com.
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id471972"></a><a id="id471974"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
When is the BeBox going to be on sale?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Be plans to make the BeBox available to the general public in the
first quarter of 1996. This means that you will be able to purchase a
BeBox (configured with peripherals or not) from Be or from one of its
resellers or VARs, with the native Be CodeWarrior development environment
bundled. During 1996, we expect most purchasers to be programming
hobbyists and professionals who are developing software for their own
use, or for eventual sale to other BeBox owners.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id471993"></a><a id="id471996"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What will it cost?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Be has not set its final pricing for the initial BeBox configurations,
partly because we expect component prices to continue to change (read
"fall") prior to our release date. We've announced that we expect the
pricing to be about $1,600 for a bare-bones (non configured) system, and
estimate that a configured system will be in the $2,500 range. We'll
announce firm prices as the release date approaches.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id472013"></a><a id="id472016"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Where can I buy a BeBox?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Initially, we expect that you will be able to purchase the BeBox from
three sources. First will be through our resellers and VARs. Second will
be directly from Be, via the Internet. In this case, your order will be
sent to one of several partner companies, depending on the configuration
you order. Last, we expect the BeBox to be made available through
organizations such as universities. More details will be available as we
approach our initial ship date.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id472034"></a><a id="id472037"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What are Be's plans for distribution outside the U.S.?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Be does plan to distribute outside the U.S. In fact we already have a
developer program up and running in Europe and have established corporate
offices in Paris, France, for developer services and marketing
activities. European developers can contact our Paris offices directly
at: devbe@beeurope.worldnet.net.
</p><p>
Be plans to initially release the BeBox in the U.S. and France. After the
initial release we plan to expand distribution to other European, Asian,
and Pacific countries as quickly as we can. Our main gating item will be
identifying distribution and other partners in the various countries and
regions. We invite interested parties to send us questions and
information to either marketing@be.com or devbe@beeurope.worldnet.net.
</p><p>
To set expectations correctly, the Be OS will initially be released in
English. We expect to release other versions of the Be OS in other
Roman-character languages as quickly as possible. We will post
information about these releases to the Be web site after the initial
