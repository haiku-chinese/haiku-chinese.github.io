Programming in a multithreaded environment can be tricky. The key is to
synchronize your threads' access to the data structures that you define.
The classical way to synchronize threads is to wrap a mutex around each
critical section through the use of a semaphore. In other words:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">a_protection_semaphore</code>)
<span class="comment">/*
  Critical Section:
  Manipulate the Data Structure Here.
*/</span>
<code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">a_protection_semaphore</code>).
</pre><p>
This is a perfectly valid use of a semaphore—but at a cost. Typically,
acquiring and releasing a semaphore takes about 35 microseconds. This
overhead can add significantly to the cost of manipulating the data
structure. It's not unusual for the semaphore calls to take more time
than the critical section itself.
</p><p>
There is a better way. In the app server, we use a slight variation on
the semaphore idea which some of us called the "benaphore." A benaphore
is a combination of an "atomic" variable (a variable that's used in
<code class="function">atomic_add()</code> calls) and a semaphore. You use the atomic variable to test
whether the current invasion of the critical section needs the mutex, and
then you acquire the semaphore only if the mutex is called for. On the
way out of the critical section, the variable is once again checked to
see if some other thread is waiting to enter the section; if there is
such a thread, the semaphore is released. This is easier to express in
code.
</p><p>
First, we declare and initialize our variables.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">benaphore_atom</code>;
<span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">benaphore_sem</code>;

<span class="type">long</span> <code class="function">init_benaphore</code>()
{
   <code class="varname">benaphore_lock</code> = 0;
   <code class="varname">benaphore_sem</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code>("benaphore", 0);

   if (<code class="varname">benaphore_sem</code> &lt; <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>)
      return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
   else
      return <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>;
}
</pre><p>
Next, we define two new functions, <code class="function">acquire_benaphore()</code> and
<code class="function">release_benaphore()</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">acquire_benaphore</code>()
{
   <span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">previous_value</code>;
   <code class="varname">previous_value</code> = <code class="function">atomic_add</code> (&amp;<code class="varname">benaphore_atom</code>, 1);

   if (<code class="varname">previous_value</code> &gt; 0)
      <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">benaphore_sem</code>);
}

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">release_benaphore</code>()
{
   <span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">previous_value</code>;
   <code class="varname">previous_value</code> = <code class="function">atomic_add</code> (&amp;<code class="varname">benaphore_atom</code>, -1);

   if (<code class="varname">previous_value</code> &gt; 1)
      <code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">benaphore_sem</code>);
}
</pre><p>
Finally, we replace the <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> and
<code class="function">release_sem()</code> calls with calls
to <code class="function">acquire_benaphore()</code> and <code class="function">release_benaphore()</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="function">acquire_benaphore</code>();
<span class="comment">/* Critical Section */</span>
<code class="function">release_benaphore</code>();
</pre><p>
Before each trip into the critical section, the visiting thread checks
the value of the atomic variable and, at the same time, increments the
variable's value (this retrieve-and-increment simultaneity is the
function's atomicity). If the pre-incremented value isn't 0, then some
other thread is currently in the critical section and so our access must
be controlled by the semaphore. Conversely, if the pre-incremented atomic
value is 0, then our thread can charge on in without waiting to acquire
the semaphore.
</p><p>
Now consider what happens on the way out of the critical section. Again
the atomic variable's value is retrieved and set (decremented, in this
case) at the same time. A pre-decrement value that's greater than 1
indicates that one or more threads is waiting to enter the critical
section: We give the next thread the go-ahead by releasing the semaphore.
On the other hand, if the atomic value is 1, no other thread is waiting
(remember, our thread incremented the atomic value to 1 itself). So we
move on without releasing the semaphore.
</p><p>
Why is the benaphore better than the plain semaphore? Because checking
the value of an atomic variable is a *lot* faster than acquiring a
semaphore. In the case where the critical section is rarely contested (in
other words, where the section is usually visited by only one thread at a
time), the time saved can be enormous: An uncontested trip through the
critical section that's protected by a benaphore has an overhead of under
1.5 microseconds. That's twenty times faster than using a semaphore.
</p><p>
Of course, the benaphore imposes an overhead of its own (the atomic
variable check); this overhead is unnecessary if there's a lot of
contention for the critical section. But even in the worst case, the
atomic variable overhead gets lost in the noise of the context switch.

As its name implies, CodeGen, Inc. is in the business of generating code.
The three-person company, located in San Francisco, serves the computer
industry with products such as <span class="trademark">SmartAlloc</span>™, a C memory allocator;
<span class="trademark">SmartCollect</span>™, a garbage-collecting memory allocator; and
<span class="trademark">SmartFirmware</span>™, an OpenFirmware implementation for embedded systems.
They also do contract programming.
</p><p>
Chairman Parag Patel says the BeBox is the only system that's fun and
easy to program and use. “<span class="quote">The Mac ceased being fun quite some time ago,
and PCs have never been fun under any operating system—it really beats
programming for Windows NT (shiver!). As for UNIX, see 'The UNIX-HATERS
Handbook' for more comments.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">In many ways, the BeBox is what I wish the Mac could be. It's a way cool
box with a nice lightweight OS and class library, it has multithreading
that doesn't suck, reliable memory-protection, enough POSIX stuff to port
things easily, and a database for a file system. Tons of I/O is nice too.</span>”
</p><p>
Thomas J. Merritt, president of CodeGen, isn't sure what business Be will
end up in, but says, “<span class="quote">It's clear with the interest it's generating and
the coolness of the box, it's going to find a niche somewhere.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I think it would make a terrific networking server. The only other thing
that comes close in price/performance is a generic PC loaded with
FreeBSD, but that's a pain to configure. Windows NT and pay-for UNIX cost
more, and other desktop OS's don't offer memory protection or other
niceties the BeBox has.</span>” Parag adds, “<span class="quote">With the GeekPort, the BeBox could
also be nice as a user-friendly factory floor controller.</span>”
</p><p>
Parag and Thomas plan to do contract programming (such as device driver
ports) for the BeBox in addition to developing their own products. So
far, they've ported SmartAlloc to the BeBox, and plan to port their host
implementation of SmartFirmware later this summer.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We'd like to create something for the BeBox. Maybe a decent HTML WYSIWYG
editor, of which none exist as yet on any platform. Heck, something as
simple as WriteNow for the Be would be nice, too.</span>”

We all agree we need good cryptography. It's good for privacy, it's good
for business. The only remaining obstacles are governments, bureaucrats,
politicians, individuals, and groups who use national security and the
fear of crime to further their quest for power, budgets, and votes. The
argument is this: Criminals and enemies can't be allowed to communicate
under the cloak of impenetrable cryptography, the consequences would be
too dire for the nation's security, the safety of our families and
possessions. As a result, our government has banned export of hard
encryption technology and has promoted various soft encoding schemes for
domestic purposes. Both are failing and there is hope that fearful and
brutish common sense will give way to facts and the calculus of
consequences. Or, it might just be a dollop of good old greed lubricating
the wheels of commerce.
</p><p>
Domestically, the talk of putting our keys in escrow isn't going down
very well. For all the reassuring talk of judicial oversight and due
process in allowing government agencies access to our encrypted data, we
harbor a healthy distrust of the police, bureaucrats, and intelligence
agencies. Perhaps this is nothing but a projection of our low
self-esteem. Or just a reaction to the enduring spectacle of corruption
and incompetence in various guardian agencies. We don't trust the
trustees. Furthermore, an escrow scheme might violate principles of good
design: The keys have to be stored under lock and key. That lock could be
broken by negligence or malice. A single point of failure might expose a
large number of keys. The problems don't stop here. More generally, any
encryption soft enough to be penetrated by bureaucrats is also vulnerable
to sophisticated hackers and criminals, or an alliance of both. Consider
the vintage air traffic control systems. Government might not enjoy a
monopoly on the best computers and programmers. As a result, billions of
electronic messages and transactions might be vulnerable to sophisticated
crooks. In the name of fighting crime, we might abet it.
</p><p>
Internationally, the situation is worse. Hard cryptography is considered
a munition and its export is illegal. As a result, US cryptography
companies are losing export business and software publishers have to
forbid export of US products containing "dangerous" encoding; they must
create weaker versions for overseas markets. This in a world where
software travels in a pocket, on a laptop, or in files over the Net.
Besides losses and inconvenience, these ineffectual restrictions engender
scorn and ridicule on the international scene. There is hope, though. For
years, Phil Zimmerman, the inventor of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), was
harassed by the Feds. He was suspected of violating the law restricting
the export of his public-key encryption software, as if, for the reasons
stated above, anyone could prevent his code from traveling abroad. With a
reluctant bow to reality, charges have been dropped—for now, they
said. And, once again, Japan, Inc. is coming to the rescue, providing
helpful disruption. NTT, the big and powerful Japanese telephone company,
helped by a constitution much more protective of privacy than ours, is
preparing to market hard encryption chips. Now our politicians have the
fig leaf they need. Instead of using the fear of crime to get votes, they
can use the fear of losing jobs. We can't let foreign companies dominate
the encryption market and take jobs from US workers: Let's update our
legislation. It's nice to see business interests aligned with our privacy
needs.
</p><p>
As one of our investors says, Be was born on the web. So more than
established businesses, we need the web to gain critical mass, to reach
and support developers and customers all over the world. Soon we'll sell
the BeBox on the web. We'll help developers market their applications and
deliver software on the web. Micro transactions, the delivery of
intellectual property, even the availability of play-only content, all
depend on the worldwide availability of unencumbered hard cryptography.
Call it what you will: Greed, commerce, or the need for privacy,
governments (not just ours) will have to bow to reality and stay out of
the way.
