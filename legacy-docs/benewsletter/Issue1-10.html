Over the last few weeks we've received 287 entries for the "Name the Be
OS" contest, many of which were great, and others of which
were....ummm....interesting. In parallel we've also been talking to
partner companies, members of the media, and others whose feedback we
value. And after extensive deliberation, we've decided that the winning
name is...
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id474251"></a>The Be Operating System (Be OS)</h3></div></div></div><p>
We received a wide array of suggestions from every area. But we also
received a large number of responses that suggested that we "keep it as
clear and simple as possible." It's hard to argue with this advice.
</p><p>
In keeping with the spirit of the competition, the ten prize-winning
entries (selected at random) are:

With more swash than buckle, the big computer shops impress my drooling
cousins from Nebraska through the medium America uses to display its
funniest home videos. My favorite opens on 80-year-old Giuseppe strolling
the vineyard with his (ahem) "granddaughter" as he explains, in a
curiously reverential whisper, that he has just completed his degree
(discipline unrevealed) from The University of Godforsaken Indiana, such
accomplishment made possible through the benevolence of the
Internet-savvy folks at IBM (or maybe it's Microsoft—they all look the
same from here). The commercial ends with Giovanni peering weepily into
the near heavens and proclaiming
</p><p>
"It's a wonderful time to be alive."
</p><p>
Excuse me, Gian-Carlo: You live in a villa on the south slope of the
Monte Trecchio; you amble timeless through the family vineyard with your
ebon-eyed mistress (they can't fool me), barefoot and grape-stained to
the calves, sidling at half an arm's length—and you think it's a great
time to be alive because of the Internet? Hie thee to a chat room.
That'll cure you.
</p><p>
(Not to knock the Internet—Be has certainly been well served by its
Web site—but most home pages I've seen have the appeal and elegance of
a pesky little orange dog yapping at your heels "Click here, click here,
click here." And what can you say in a forum that recognizes only two
terms of approbation: "cool" and "check it out." This reminds me of a
true story. A friend of mine knew a Russian fellow, recently arrived to
America, who had learned English by watching American movies and
cartoons. Although he spoke with a strong accent, his grammatical
purchase was reasonably fixed and his comprehension fluent.
Unfortunately, his earnest exclamations of "Well blow me down" and
"Shiver me timbers" brought all conversation to an embarrassed halt.)
</p><p>
Although the commercial doesn't much suggest that this scene is offered
ironically, I suppose we're no more expected to accept this hacker Don
realistically than we are gulled by shepherds guarding their hard disks
in the rain on a chalky cliff outside Cardiff, or are taken in by fashion
models, legs up to their armpits, discussing "data mining" on a runway.
But even conceding irony, one questions the wisdom of setting a computer
advertisement in, as another example, a Venetian piazza. You do what you
think best, but if I'm sitting outside St. Marks, I'm not looking at a
PowerBook.
</p><p>
Be doesn't do television commercials. We don't have to; we've got the
Media Kit.
</p><p>
The Media Kit was designed and implemented by Rob Poor, a fellow whose
sound hardware and signal-processing credentials laid end to end stretch
halfway from here to Mr. Nyquist and then fold over. Someday, the Kit
will let you record, synchronize, and broadcast a variety of media
signals; currently, it just does sound. (Unfortunately for us, Mr. Poor
was tempted beyond his resolve by the allure of poverty and student
housing. He had just finished the audio portion of the Media Kit when he
was accepted into the Media Lab at MIT.)
</p><p>
If you've tried writing sound-generating or -processing applications on
other computers, you'll appreciate the transparency of the Media Kit. The
Kit brings you within kissing distance of the sound hardware (the Crystal
CS4231 audio codec), but takes care of the brutalities of buffer
scheduling and data transfer for you. To receive sound data that's
recorded from the microphone, for example, all you have to do is create a
BAudioSubscriber-derived object, tell it to "subscribe" to the sound-in
stream, and then enter the stream. Buffers of sound data appear
automatically as the Kit invokes your object's call-back function (which
you define as part of your derived class).
</p><p>
Broadcasting sound is similarly simple: You subscribe to and then enter
the sound-out stream. The data that you add into the sound-out buffers
(which are also delivered to you through a call-back function) will
automatically find its way to the sound-out hardware (the line-out jacks,
the headphone jack, and the built-in squeaker).
</p><p>
Buffers are created and managed by the Audio Server. The Audio Server
starts automatically at boot time and then sits and waits quietly for
subscribers to enter the audio streams. It also handles volume and mute
requests, such as those generated through the Sound preferences panel.
</p><p>
Although the call-back buffer and dedicated server architecture isn't
unheard of, its implementation is remarkably efficient and flexible:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You can control the size and number of transfer buffers; by fiddling
with these numbers, you can fine-tune the real-time response of your
application.
</p></li><li><p>
The Audio Server locks the data transfer buffers into RAM, and Media
Kit thread priorities are higher than other system-defined threads.
This helps ensure that your real-time application will avoid swapping,
and will get the heightened attention that it needs.
</p></li><li><p>
Sound data is shared by all the subscribers to a particular stream.
For example, you can design a reverberator that operates on sound data
that's generated by other sound-out subscriber objects in other
applications. The data that's generated by these other subscribers
automatically appears as the input to your reverberator through its
call-back function.
</p></li></ul><p>
(This last point is particularly amusing. You can use the Media Kit's
audio streams to transfer data—any data—between applications.
Although this isn't a serious alternative to ports or the BMessage
system, someone will think of a sportive and unexpected use.)
</p><p>
The world isn't perfect: Although the Crystal's analog-to-digital
converter is extremely linear, it does have a slight, slowly fluctuating
DC offset. Currently, there's no API to connect the sound-in stream to
the sound-out stream (you can do it yourself—it's not that difficult
—but it would be nice if the Kit did it for you). And if you're reading
and mixing sound files, the Kit's lightening may be grounded by the
shrieking seeks of your hard disk.
</p><p>
But put the uncontrollable, fixable, and external aside, the Media Kit
and its relationship with the sound hardware provides you, the signal
processor and vineyard owner, with enough power to scare my cousins.
Shiver me timbers.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-10"></a>Be Developer Profile: Abiogenesis Software</h2></div></div></div><p>
It might surprise some to find that despite all of the hype about
multimedia and the world-wide web, the most popular computer programs are
still things like word processors and databases—even among educators
and researchers who are considered to be on the cutting edge of
technology.
</p><p>
Julie Petersen and John Seagrave looked at that and saw an opportunity.
Indeed, they were smart enough to know that they couldn't jump into the
word processing game with Microsoft and Lotus. But they recognized that
"people universally want to create and access information," according to
Petersen. So they started Abiogenesis in 1994 to produce authoring tools
for creating electronic multimedia dictionaries.
</p><p>
Last year they introduced Lexicographer, a dictionary authoring program
that they hope will fundamentally change electronic reference books the
way desktop publishing changed the document and printing industry. The
program costs between $199 and $299, depending on features. That makes
reference publishing available to the masses, instead of just the large
companies that can afford complex reference authoring systems that
typically cost between $350,000 and $2.5 million.
</p><p>
Abiogenesis also publishes a $29.95 dictionary viewer called Lexica. The
company launched its first product on the Macintosh "because many
publishers and educators prefer Macs and we wanted it to be easy to use,"
Petersen says.
</p><p>
"But we're never satisfied," she adds. "We also wanted fluid
multitasking, fast compilation, better sound, video clips, Internet
connectivity, and opportunities to implement new ideas. The BeBox has the
horsepower for us to move past current entrenched technologies."
</p><p>
Abiogenesis expects to have Lexicographer available for the BeBox in
three to four months. They're porting it over from the Macintosh so they
can get something out quickly, Petersen says. But they have other product
plans for the BeBox that will take a year to 18 months to come to market.
</p><p>
"People may think that supporting low-volume computers is bad business,
that the only good markets are big markets," Petersen says. "Sometimes it
takes only one product, like the Video Toaster, to change an industry. We
think a few key products in hot markets can kick the BeBox into high
gear. And we'll have a lot more fun doing it than any Windows devotee
could ever imagine."

I feel better about our country and our community. Congress got me
worried, but I feel better after seeing the strong reactions to the
passage of the "decency" provisions in the Telecommunications Bill. "Why
do you care?" you might ask. "You're not in the business of peddling smut
on the net, you don't plan to use indecent language or images to promote
your business. So, why get involved in a controversy that doesn't concern
you?"
</p><p>
Well, it affects us in more than one way.
</p><p>
In the first place, I believe in the Constitution of my adopted country.
As an immigrant in a nation of immigrants, I came here for the freedoms
our culture affords us. Freedom of enterprise, freedom of speech; to me,
they're connected. As an individual, as an entrepreneur, I experience a
greater sense of freedom here than in the Old Country, with its more
refined and more constricting caste system. Any attempt to abridge
freedom of speech I see as a threat to our society and to me, personally.
And for the notion that "good citizens have nothing to fear," please,
read history. Oppressive governments use that line all the time. By
definition, we have something to fear from governments. They're run by
human beings, with normal tendencies to use and abuse the tools at their
disposal. That's why our Constitution (and its amendments) offer
safeguards. In the former Soviet Union, the people had civil rights,
guaranteed by their constitution... save for the People's enemies, who
had no rights. If we start banning material on the net that is today
legal on paper, book-burnings aren't very far away.
</p><p>
Second, we care a lot for the net at Be. It's been nice to this little
start-up. The net, as the protest proves, is still a community without a
Big Brother. It's the big equalizer instead, a place where individuals
and companies can have a voice, a reach they couldn't otherwise afford.
The net is a helpful place, full of hope and hype, creative and anarchic,
in the original sense, without (much) hierarchy. Of course, the
protection of children will be invoked as an excuse. As if the bullets in
the streets and in the schools were not bigger threats. It's a lot easier
for we parents to protect our kids from "bad" sites than to shield them
from weapons. We can't take the weapons back, it's not popular, but we
can take back freedom of speech from the net. Cyberspace is more
dangerous than our streets; or, perhaps easier to police—they think.
The net sneaked up on them, on all of us. They're afraid of it because of
its power, because they don't understand it, because it's not
centralized. Someone once equated the web to the printing press of the
next century. He or she must be right. They are trying to do to the net
what they used to do to the books.
</p><p>
Let's show them wrong.

The BeBox is already penetrating many countries in Europe.
</p><p>
We had the very first public appearance of the BeBox at the IT Forum in
Paris last week. This is one of the two largest industry shows in France.
It gathers 90,000 visitors, mostly French, over a period of six days. A
sort of mini-Comdex for professionals.
</p><p>
A "village" of the major PowerPC players was built in the middle of the
expo. Be Europe had its own small booth at the entrance to the village,
in the immediate neighborhood of the big guys: IBM, Apple, Bull,
Motorola, and so on. We set up three BeBoxes, one on a big screen to give
public presentations, the two others dedicated to early versions of
independent software vendors' applications, demonstrated by their
authors. With our four-person European team, with Jean-Louis, and above
all with the help of our already existing French Be fan club, there was a
permanent presence of at least six geeks in Be T-shirts welcoming the
public.
</p><p>
Without making any comparisons to what happened at MacWorld some weeks
ago, our booth was crowded the whole week, some of us lost our voices,
and everybody is exhausted—but proud and happy. A quick calculation
has shown that more than 5000 people attended the 15-minute presentation
and demo, we received another 100 developer applications, and I had a
tough time trying to explain to certain people that I could not accept an
order at the booth and that there was no public price yet!
</p><p>
I would not dare say that we gained any victory, but I was struck by a
few facts I want to share with you. Despite the fact that a Directeur
Informatique from a very large French firm told me that "he knew it was
an Alpha-chip-based monoprocessor platform running Linux dedicated to
real-time applications [sic!]," most of the visitors to our booth already
had a pretty good idea of what the BeBox is and could become. Thanks to
France Telecom, France probably has the lowest Internet subscriber
penetration (around 80,000) in Europe, but nevertheless, Be and its
product are already pretty well known by the enlightened French amateurs
and professionals. The power and bandwidth of Internet as a marketing
tool are not to be underestimated!
</p><p>
De facto we were one of the biggest (if not the only) attractions of the
show. People were very encouraging to us and I heard many comments like
"This is exactly what needs to be done," or "Finally this industry has
decided to move ahead with new operating system," and even
"incompatibility means creativity and progress."
</p><p>
But I must say that I also heard "you guys have no chance to survive,
because you're not compatible" a couple of times. I would direct that
kind of person to some of our present developers, who were demonstrating
the first versions of their applications: A very creative incarnation of
a web browser, a word processor from Lorienne [Now BeatWare] with
innovative implementations of the drag-and-drop metaphor, the first
version of a flight simulator (for two players) developed by Ex Algebra,
or the "Geekplayer" application, developed by Mipsys (see the article
about Mipsys in the next issue of this newsletter).
</p><p>
Our industry, even if it suffers (you noticed less spending on booth
decoration), is growing rapidly in Europe and Be has a large potential
here.
</p><p>
Europe as usual is following US technological progress by a few months or
years. For the first time in '95, more PCs than cars or TVs were sold in
most of the Western European countries. With a penetration that is still
lower than in the US, the home market is growing at 40 percent a year in
most of these countries, in a global market that (according to Dataquest)
is grew by 20 percent last year in volume. France, which is the smallest
of the big three European markets, reached 2 million units last year. In
a pretty dull economy, where unemployment exceeds 11 percent, the growth
in volume of PC sales was more than 18 percent last year; no other
economic sectors had the same kind of growth.
</p><p>
Developers are looking for something new and attractive that can help
them make some dollars. Today we have over 50 independent software
vendors active in Europe, 65 percent of them outside of France, with a
higher ratio in the northern part of Europe. We had 14 different
nationalities represented at our first European GeekFest!
</p><p>
It's interesting to consider that countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
or even Iceland already have active Be developers. I also know some
German companies who are working on music applications. Surprised? The
Nordic part of Europe has always endorsed technology earlier than the
southern part (see the penetration of mobile phones). This is
particularly true for the Internet as already demonstrated by some
Be-related initiatives in Norway.
</p><p>
We'll have many occasions in the future to participate in public events
in Europe, where we will actively promote our developers' applications
and savoir-faire. We would also like to encourage communication,
exchanges, and meetings across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This
company was born with International blood in its body and the product
will have more and more international flavors in the future. One day --
maybe soon—you'll be willing to promote your software out of your
country's boundaries, and we're ready to help!
