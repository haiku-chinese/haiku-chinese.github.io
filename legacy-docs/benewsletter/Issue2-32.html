"Forget Fen-Phen! Not Weightloss"
</p><p>
"Email Photos to Friends &amp; Family * Display on Website * Save on your
Computer!"
</p><p>
"Balding? New Medications Regrow Hair"
</p><p>
"Best Selling Software---Try It FREE!!!"
</p><p>
One of my email addresses have been made public (sold???) and is now in
the hands of the 1990s version of the "Snake Oil Salesman." A day doesn't
go by where I'm not bombarded with enticing offers to lose weight, regrow
my hair, improve my sex life or get rich quick. I've even received
solicitations by the companies that create the spamming software, and for
a price, I too, can become a spammer.
</p><p>
So it seems that a popular use of a modern day OS is for email spamming,
which got me thinking, with the BeOS we have the most modern of modern
OSes and yet there is no spamming program. So the point of this
newsletter article (besides fulfilling my obligation to provide this
week's Insight) is to remedy this situation (for better or worse).
</p><p>
Our "Marketing Tool for the 90s" will build on mail and query features
built into the BeOS. For simplicity, our tool will be command line based
and will take three arguments: subject; message file path; and the
predicate for an address book query.
</p><p>
(What address book you ask? There is a crude version built into the
Preview Release; a more fleshed out version will be available with a
forthcoming update to the Preview Release).
</p><p>
We start by constructing a <code class="classname">BApplication</code> and overriding the
<code class="methodname">ArgvReceived()</code>
and <code class="methodname">ReadyToRun()</code> methods. The
<code class="methodname">ArgvReceived()</code> function does some simple sanity
checking of the parameters, opens and buffers the message content, and
calls the <code class="methodname">Spam()</code> function to do the processing.
The <code class="methodname">ReadyToRun()</code> function
alerts the user if the application was executed incorrectly and quits the
application:

With this simple application and the following command I can target my
message to a specific audience:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ Spam 'Reduce coding time by two thirds' blatant_lie.txt
       PERSON:group=*bedevtalk*
</pre><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id580476"></a>BeOS Mail Format</h3></div></div></div><p>
The second part of this article will describe the format of an email
message generated by the BeOS.
</p><p>
According to RFC822, all email messages are required to have a Date and
From field. These fields will be generated automatically if they are not
explicitly set (using the <code class="methodname">AddHeaderField</code>(<code class="constant">B_MAIL_DATE</code>, ...) and
<code class="methodname">AddHeaderField</code>(<code class="constant">B_MAIL_FROM</code>, ...) functions).
</p><p>
The <code class="varname">Date</code>, if not explicitly set, is the time
the Kit receives the <code class="methodname">Send()</code>
command. The <code class="varname">From</code> field construction is a bit more complicated. It's
constructed from fields defined in both the E-mail and Network preference
applications:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Real Name" POP_User_Name@Domain_Name
</pre><p>
If "Real Name" is not defined, the "User Name" defined in the Network
panel will be substituted. If "Pop User Name" is not defined the Network
Host Name will be substituted.
</p><p>
So as you can see, the <code class="varname">From</code> field generated may not be the correct
address to which incoming mail should be sent, so a <code class="varname">Reply To</code> field is
provided. If the <code class="varname">Reply To</code> field is left blank in the E-mail panel, none
will be added (unless the mail client explicitly sets it). If the client
explicitly sets a <code class="varname">Reply To</code> field, the Kit will use this one instead of
the defined one.
</p><p>
The only other field needed to send a message is either a <code class="varname">To</code> or <code class="varname">Bcc</code>
field. If the recipient name is set through the <code class="varname">Bcc</code> field, the recipient
names are suppressed in the actual message.
</p><p>
The Kit will also add a default X-Mailer field to the header if one
hasn't been explicitly set. Any additional header fields can be added
using the <code class="methodname">AddHeaderField()</code> command. There is no checking by the Kit for the
validity of these fields.
</p><p>
For non-MIME type messages, a Content-Type field will also be added with
the correct text encoding. The text conversion will be done by the Kit
when setting the content field. By default the text will be converted to
ISO-8859-1. Other conversions can be set with the <code class="methodname">AddContent()</code> call.
</p><p>
For multi-part messages (enclosures and text with more than one
conversion) two additional fields are added to the header: MIME-version
field and Content-Type field. The MIME-version is set to "1.0". The
Content-Type field is set to "multipart/mixed" and a boundary is defined.
</p><p>
At each boundary point in the message, a Content-Type field will be
present. For text sections this is the same for non-MIME messages
(including the text conversions). For enclosure sections the Content-Type
is the same as the Content-Type defined in the header including a new
boundary.
</p><p>
Before we describe an enclosure section we need some background on a BeOS
file. For all practical purposes, the BeOS is a forked file system --
meaning that the contents (text, pictures, etc.) of the file is saved in
one fork and the attributes (window position, user preferences, etc.) is
stored in another fork (or forks).
</p><p>
When sending a BeOS file as an enclosure it's best to keep all forks
intact in case the recipient is also using the BeOS. For users of other
OSes, they're likely to be interested only in the content portion of the
file. To accomplish this the file is broken up into the content part and
the attribute part (all attributes are concatenated into this single
part) and are nested under their own MIME boundary.
</p><p>
The file content comes first under its own Content-Type header with the
type set to the same MIME type of the file followed by the file name. The
attribute part comes next with its own Content-Type header set to
"application/x-be_attribute" followed by the file name. Both parts are
encoded using base64.

So... You've been to the latest BeDC have you? Well, did you see the
naked people riding their bicycles in the rain?
</p><p>
I tell you, I've always had a certain amount of fear and trepidation when
it comes to travelling to the East coast of the United States. I always
thought it was my fear of getting stuck in a snow storm, but now I know
the real fear is that there are some real loonies out there! And I lived
in Berkeley for several years.
</p><p>
Moving the BeDC to the east caused several of our demos to crash. What an
unheard of event. The demo gods definitely were not smiling upon us on
the 4th. But, to the credit of the Be OS community, most developers were
quite pleased and excited to see the latest and greatest stuffs. If you
were there you may have seen Doug Fulton's paper detector sample
application, or Jean-Louis' likeness in more than one 3D application. I
think the most exciting thing came with Pierre's demo where he did a
Jean-Louis head in a temple setting with lots of butterflies flying
around. To top this one off, it was accelerated with the 3Dfx chip set,
so it was nice, smooth, and fast with nice textures to boot. This was due
to the combined efforts of Geoff's glide library support and George being
inspired enough to create an accelerated version of the 3D Kit in short
order.
</p><p>
Speaking of acceleration, what's all the hullabalu about this 3Dfx chip
set anyway? As I've said in the past, this chip set is arguably one of
the most popular in PC class boards today. Their relatively low cost and
tremendous speed have made them the target of affection for the latest
and greatest games on the PC platform, and now the BeOS. So what about
acceleration? We have played with Mesa, which is a freely available
OpenGL®-like implementation. Brian Paul, the author, will tell you that
it's not OpenGL®, is not an OpenGL® licensed product, and it does not
necessarily run the OpenGL® conformance test suite. But I use it anyway
because it allows us to do accelerated OpenGL® right now today.
</p><p>
Where does that leave our licensed OpenGL® implementation? We are
currently working to extend our OpenGL® implementation to make it more
easily accept hardware acceleration in the future. Be Inc. is not putting
Mesa out as a replacement for our own implementation. In DTS we felt it
would be extremely beneficial to have a implementation of OpenGL® that
took advantage of hardware acceleration. Mesa is freely available, and it
didn't require too much work on our part to make it available. So there
you have it. Mesa is available today, our own extensible OpenGL® will be
out in the future, with more hardware support following.
</p><p>
How can one describe MacWorld? Well, after 2 days straight of our own
conference, head on over to the World Trade Center and do some more time
over there. Booth duty is fun. No really. When you're assigned to what we
call the "large demo" you get to see massive crowds at every one of your
demos. Giving this demo is likened to inciting a riot. You slowly build
up from one application to the next, each time running more applications
at the same time. In the finale, when you have 4 QuickTime movies playing
along, with pulsating 3D objects, CD sound, digitized stereo sound, and
DOOM playing in the background, while you're browsing web pages on your
desktop...the pulse tends to quicken.
</p><p>
And the most fun of all, once you've shown all this, you look at the
crowd with the wry vampire smile and yell at the crowd, "DO YOU WANT TO
DO THIS TO YOUR MAC?" and they wildly and desperately respond "YES!!" and
they faint to the ground. And the sweetest response you could give, "of
course you do, and you can, because today the BeOS is freely available,
here, just take this disk and install it on your Mac." They blink a
couple of times, and ask how the demo is crippled, and you tell them, no
timeout, not limitations, go ahead, take it, the first one's free.
</p><p>
It's also very gratifying to be able to yank people into our booth by
showing them third party applications that are actually shipping. This is
a big moment in the history of the BeOS. With the exception of LCS and
Metrowerks, this is the first time commercial apps are shipping for the
BeOS. In our booth we were selling the BeSpecific disk and Audio Elements
from Adamation, and Be Basics and BeStudio from BeatWare. Time and again
people would ask, how do I do word processing, and I would say, Just buy
BeBasics and you're all set. I think the whole community should be
grateful to these early developers for making bold moves towards
commercial success. When investors and users see that there are companies
making a successful go of it commercially, they tend to pay more
attention and vote with their own dollars.

So, I went out to dinner with the Adamation crew on one occasion, and it
was very interesting. The topics covered in conversation ranged from
Cockney Rhymes to sawed off bee bee guns. From Roswell conspiracies, to
the domination of a new digital media environment. You simply had to be
there to understand why we were all rolling on the floor laughing for 3
hours, but since you probably weren't, suffice it to say, that the BeOS
community is a lively and kickin' place, and there's nowhere else I'd
rather be at the moment. Besides, I've picked up quite a few CDs of dance
music, and I'm anxious to try them out with that nifty Pulsar Application.
</p><p>
See you on the Front.

We get many questions, in person or via e-mail, regarding the
Microsoft/Apple deal and, of course, I have an opinion, actually more
than one. But too much has been written already on the short-term impact,
the loaded symbolism of last week's events at Apple. I'm more interested
in mulling over the longer-term consequences and, for this, I'd like to
see a few more specks of dust settle down. In particular, I'd like to
understand the meaning of the unexpected silence on some loaded topics.
</p><p>
As for our little company, we had a great week for one reason: BeOS
developers. Monday and Tuesday, August 4th and 5th, we held a Developers'
Conference at the Haynes Convention Center, ending with a Masters Awards
party at the Boston Computer Museum. Pierre Raynaud-Richard also presided
over a 24-hour 3D Kit programming contest.
</p><p>
On a parallel thread, Alex, Wes and I got up at 1:30am Tuesday morning,
drove up to New York in the rain, gave an investor presentation, and came
back to Boston in time for another early afternoon meeting. We won't do
this too often, I hope, but it felt good seeing BeOS applications emerge
as we were evangelizing investors.
</p><p>
As reported elsewhere, the Masters Awards generated over 100 submissions
and the quality was such that we had some really difficult decisions on
our hands. I won't state here what my favorites are, but I can say I'm
impressed with the overall quality and creativity, as well as the way
they express unique features of our OS, such as the combination of
multi-processing and multi-threading, and the resulting agility and
bandwidth.
</p><p>
The same is true of the 3D hackfest. With the first release of our 3D
Kit, the programming contest provided a test of the expressive power and
efficiency of this new addition to the BeOS. The traditional rotating
kettle, familiar to OpenGL® programmers, now serves as a mirror for an
orbiting cow textured on the fly, inevitably leading to jokes about an
impending presentation of the Intel version to Gateway (no such plans at
this time).
</p><p>
The conference consisted of technical sessions mixed with demonstrations
of new products by BeOS developers anxious to trot their creations before
an audience of their peers. This tested our product in places that
probably hadn't been touched before—meaning we discovered fresh new
bugs and gained a sense of urgency for the search-and-destroy expedition
now taking place in our office. The 28,000 copies of the Preview Release
we distributed at MacWorld are certain to provide us with more feedback
and opportunities to refine our product.
</p><p>
As is now usual, but we don't take it for granted, our Macworld Expo
booth was well attended. The Intel BeOS demonstration was received with
an open mind (Apple probably helped by committing to Intel versions of
Rhapsody), and the performance, even at this early stage, drew positive
comments.
</p><p>
The highlight was the presence of BeOS developers—Adamation, Fusion
Development, purity, ro design, and TruSpectra—in our booth, with
BeatWare in a nearby booth of their own. We now see the beginnings of
commercial applications on our platform; some of them were on sale and
sold well at the show. I even saw BeOS software, including our $49.95
retail package, sold at the Developer Depot booth in the Apple pavilion.
</p><p>
Just as important, what emerges in common from these new applications is
that the BeOS adds one letter to WYSIWYG, the letter N—for NOW.
Real-time WYSIWYG, if you will, instead of watching the hourglass icon.
This isn't just about getting tasks done faster and more securely; just
as important, this is about preventing wait-time from intruding on the
flow of creative thoughts. Such a benefit applies beyond multimedia
creation: Ask a programmer how s/he feels waiting around for a compile.
</p><p>
This said, we're now in the process of broadcasting a million units of
the BeOS for the remainder of this calendar year. My heartfelt thanks to
all who helped prepare and deliver last week's events and motivated us to
do even better in the future.

Lots of comments about the BeOS-on-Intel announcement. Surprisingly (or
maybe not—it's a funny world), we didn't hear much "don your garlic
necklace, we're going into the crypt" sentiment. In fact, the port to
Intel is seen by some as a righteous crusade; as Bryan Copeland put
it...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The majority of computer users use Intel technology... which is why I
can't wait for Be on Intel... get people off of the Microsoft operating
systems...</span>”
</p><p>
The main thread concentrated on hardware—which motherboard/chip set
configurations will be supported (and when)? Will ADC/DAC users be
thrown into the grungy abyss of PC sound cards?
</p><p>
So what about the PPC? A number of listeners insist that the PPC is the
superior chip while conceding that unless CHRP solidifies soon, the
party is over. Dave Haynie...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">It's going to be hard enough a shot against the x86 if Apple grabbed
CHRP by the arms, danced the night away, and ended the evening with a
big wet smack on the lips and a few copped feels. Without an open PPC
market, Apple's doomed...</span>”
</p><p>
There was also a small discussion of the merits of fat vs. CPU-specific
binaries. Most folks seem to regard fat binaries as unessential at
best, and (looking into the future) potentially clumsy since new chips
demand more fat. It's felt that since CDs are big enough to accommodate
any number of CPU-specific images there's no reason to squish them into
a doughy mess. On a related note, cross-compiling is seen as a must.
</p><p>
Re blinking lights: Some developers are already thinking about ways to
wedge a BeBox-like LED display into the bezel of a PC clone. (How about
an LED server?)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id580961"></a>Subject: User-specified Screen Size</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should games (in particular of all types of apps) be more screen-size
aware than they are? Some folks think that as we see more wide and
arbitrarily deep monitors, a game designer should try to adapt --
perhaps by letting the user decide which screen mode to use. As Marco
Nelissen put it...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...if it doesn't find out from the system which modes are actually
available, and shows me a list to choose from, then I consider it a
poorly written game.</span>”
</p><p>
On the other side, we have the "gamewright" attitude, as expressed by
Jon Watte (or a good impersonation):
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Current games can give you a choice of the screen modes available when
they are compiled, and let you choose between them. Once arbitrary-size
comes into play, they will not list the new sizes. Big deal. They
weren't tested with the new sizes, and weren't designed to work well on
the new sizes, so there's no big loss.</span>”
</p><p>
There was some pushing and shoving over the design of the (future) API
that would support arbitrary depths and sizes.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581011"></a>Subject: BeOS appearance &amp; Replacing the Tracker?</h4></div></div></div><p>
A big question from Graham Gilmore...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">How much of the BeOS 'look' is contained in the Tracker? Let's say I
wanted to have a completely new look for BeOS ...would this be
possible, and where would I find all the stuff that would need
replacing?</span>”
</p><p>
A number of listeners called in to offer opinions and vote for
methodology. Peter Potrebic summarized Be's current thinking (see
below).
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: From Peter Potrebic...
</p><p>
The "Look" and "Feel" of the BeOS is defined by both the app_server
(the look of windows and scroll bars) and the Interface Kit (everything
else). We have several ideas for opening up these parts of the system
for customization.
</p><p>
A couple of ideas for customizing app_server windows are...
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
allow components (color, frame, etc.) to be set through a
preferences application
</p></li><li><p>
provide an add_on architecture to define completely new types of
windows
</p></li></ul><p>
Customizations in the Interface Kit could be handled by a "drop in"
library that would redefine how things look and feel (e.g. a library
that defines a new draw method for the BButton class).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581079"></a>Subject: Restarting the App Server</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is it possible to restart the app_server after it has crashed? You can
telnet into your machine and launch the app_server by hand, but it's
simpler (and probably safer) to just reboot.
</p><p>
So why does the app_server crash? Is Be trying to fix the problem?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Absolutely.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581103"></a>Subject: Accelerated OpenGL®</h4></div></div></div><p>
Does Be *really* have an OpenGL® implementation? A listener phoned in
to point out that, strictly speaking, Be has implemented Mesa.
Subterfuge? Not really, say many of our listeners—Mesa looks like
OpenGL® and quacks like OpenGL®, therefore it *is* OpenGL®. But some
folks, Osma Ahvenlampi notably, are not entirely satisfied...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Nothing in Mesa is OpenGL®, even though it might look similar or even
identical. Before anything can be called OpenGL®, it is required to be
SGI-licensed. Thus, Mesa is not, and never will be, OpenGL®.</span>”
</p><p>
The response, as given by Be's Jake Hamby:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">In order to be OpenGL®, it is NOT required to be SGI-licensed, it is
required to pass the conformance test. Whether we decide to use the SGI
sample code, the Mesa code, our own code, or a combination of them, the
OpenGL® logo will be your guarantee that it passes the conformance
tests, and is therefore, [to] all intents and purposes, OpenGL®.</span>”
</p><p>
This didn't comfort Terry Sikes...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...the difference between Mesa and OpenGL® is significant... What
version of OpenGL® does Mesa emulate? 1.0? 1.1? What about extensions?
... The best thing (IMO) for Be would be to partner with SGI and
provide SGI OpenGL® for Be. The Intel Win32 drivers would probably move
to Intel BeOS pretty easily, and from there to PowerPC. Without this,
getting hardware 3D support under BeOS will be problematic at best.</span>”
</p><p>
Jake Hamby again...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We've already licensed 'real OpenGL®.' However, *nobody* uses the
stock SGI sample implementation without extensive optimization... It's
reasonable for us to spend extensive effort into tuning, and even
replacing large portions of, the SGI sample code to get the best
possible performance for our users.</span>”
