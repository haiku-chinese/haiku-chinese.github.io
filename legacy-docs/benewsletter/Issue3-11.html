From time to time, you have to say goodbye to an old friend. It's usually
pretty sad... And this particular guy had been around way before I
started at be. He was a part of the Be spirit. I speak, of course, of the
poor Frozen Window, born of a crashed app, the one that never gets to
redraw, yet never leaves the screen. I'll miss having to drag the poor
fellow over out of the way, and then watching the system become sluggish
as updates slow down, as if the app server was crying over the death of
one of its children, suffering in silence, still alive but without joy.
</p><p>
I can't count the number of times I ran into this bug—still, nobody
ever pushed to get it fixed. Did our developers restrain themselves from
righteous indignation out of geeky consideration for the suffering of the
unlucky window? As if the poor bastard had a right to proclaim the
unfairness of its fate to the whole world...
</p><p>
In any case, the other day, I was pissed off one more time, so I started
tracking down the bug without pity, found the problem and fixed it. Good
bye my little sluggish dying window, probably never going to see you
again...
</p><p>
A complete app server rewrite is, and will remain, a myth, but a lot has
happened recently, nevertheless: the font cache (PR2), the picture
mechanism (Release 3), the rendering package (including 15/16 bpp, bezier
and sub-pixel precision, Release 3), the window manager and its
extensions (Release 3), and a lot more is on schedule for future
releases. So I would like to dedicate this article to present the new
window manager architecture and API, to help you use them at their best.
Then you'll endure a second article next week giving more details about
direct frame buffer access in a window (to do live video DMA for
example), using the new <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> class of the Game Kit.
</p><p>
Opening <code class="filename">Window.h</code>,
you will notice that a couple things have changed (but,
note, all the old official API is still supported). First thing, there is
a new <code class="classname">BWindow</code> constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BWindow</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>,
    <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">title</code>,
    <span class="type">window_look</span> <code class="parameter">look</code>,
    <span class="type">window_feel</span> <code class="parameter">feel</code>,
    <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">flags</code>,
    <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">workspace</code> = <code class="constant">B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE</code>);
</pre><p>
This is essentially the same as the old constructor, except that the
window_type parameter has been split into 2 orthogonal concepts. The
"window look"...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
enum <span class="type">window_look</span> {
  <code class="constant">B_BORDERED_WINDOW_LOOK</code> = 20,
  <code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW_LOOK</code>   =  1,
  <code class="constant">B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW_LOOK</code> = 11,
  <code class="constant">B_MODAL_WINDOW_LOOK</code>    =  3,
  <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_WINDOW_LOOK</code> =  7
};
</pre><p>
...describes the way the window will look on screen—this is what other
OS's call the "window definition" (wdef). And the "window feel"...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
enum <span class="type">window_feel</span> {
  <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>          = 0,
  <code class="constant">B_MODAL_SUBSET_WINDOW_FEEL</code>    = 2,
  <code class="constant">B_MODAL_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>       = 1,
  <code class="constant">B_MODAL_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>       = 3,
  <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_SUBSET_WINDOW_FEEL</code> = 5,
  <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>    = 4,
  <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>    = 6
};
</pre><p>
...describes the way the window will behave. The old window_type API,
which tied these two concepts together, is now automatically translated,
following those rules:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW</code>   = <code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW_LOOK</code> + <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>
<code class="constant">B_MODAL_WINDOW</code>    = <code class="constant">B_MODAL_WINDOW_LOOK</code>  + <code class="constant">B_MODAL_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>
<code class="constant">B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW</code> = <code class="constant">B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW_LOOK</code> + <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>
<code class="constant">B_BORDERED_WINDOW</code> = <code class="constant">B_BORDERED_WINDOW_LOOK</code> + <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>
</pre><p>
A new <span class="type">window_type</span> was added to describe a "standard" <span class="type">float</span>ing window :
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_WINDOW</code> = <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_WINDOW_LOOK</code> + <code class="constant">B_FLOATING_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>
</pre><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id673105"></a>The Window Looks Examined</h3></div></div></div><p>
You're already familiar with most of the <span class="type">window_look</span>s:
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_BORDERED_WINDOW_LOOK</code>: Thin (one-pixel wide) dark line around the
window; no title bar. It's used for menus.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW_LOOK</code>: Thick border; title bar (the infamous yellow tab)
with buttons.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW_LOOK</code>: Thick border; title bar with buttons; a special
area in the right bottom corner area for resizing that's designed to fit
between two scrollbars. It looks like the titled window, but with a
corner with 10 dots arranged in a triangle.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_MODAL_WINDOW_LOOK</code>: Thick border; no title bar. These are used for alert
panels.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_WINDOW_LOOK</code>: Thinner border; small title bar and buttons. It
looks like a titled window, but on a smaller scale.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id673168"></a>The Window Feels Examined</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are far more changes in the <span class="type">window_feel</span> area. Before, there were
really only two (normal and modal). Now there are seven; there's the
standard...
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_NORMAL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: Standard, stand-alone window behavior.
</p><p>
...and then there are three modal and three <span class="type">float</span>ing feels. The modals
are:
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_MODAL_SUBSET_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: A modal window that blocks all windows in its
"subset." (You define a window's subset through the <code class="classname">BWindow</code>'s
<code class="methodname">AddToSubset()</code> and
<code class="methodname">RemoveFromSubset()</code> functions.)
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_MODAL_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: A modal window that blocks all windows in its
own subset AND all non- modal windows in its own team (this should
account for the application's document windows). This is used as the
equivalent of the old <code class="constant">B_MODAL_WINDOW_TYPE</code>. To support this compatibility,
every time you create a new <code class="constant">B_MODAL_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code> window, all existing
"app modal" windows in that team are added to the subset of the new
window.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_MODAL_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: A modal window that blocks all other windows,
except for other system-wide feels (<code class="constant">B_MODAL_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code> and
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>). This feel should be used only for
system-wide announcements, not for normal applications.
</p><p>
All three modal feels share these rules:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Every time you try to activate a window that's blocked by a modal,
the modal is activated and comes to the front, instead. You can move a
blocked window, but that's the only interaction allowed with them until
the modal is closed.
</p></li><li><p>
A modal is displayed in the workspace where it's needed. For example,
if a modal blocks an entire team, then it will appear in every
workspace where a window of that team is displayed.
</p></li><li><p>
Modal windows don't show up in the Workspaces application.
</p></li></ul><p>
Here are the "<span class="type">float</span>ing feels":
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_SUBSET_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: Floats above all windows in its own subset.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_APP_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: Floats above all non-modal, non-<span class="type">float</span>ing
windows in its team (it *doesn't* <span class="type">float</span> above windows in its own subset).
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>: Floats above all other windows, except other
<code class="constant">B_FLOATING_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL</code>. This feel is typically used for input methods.
</p><p>
Floating window rules:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A <span class="type">float</span>ing window appears only when its "master" (a window that it's
supposed to <span class="type">float</span> in front of) is frontmost. If the master isn't
frontmost, the <span class="type">float</span>ing window is hidden.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span class="type">float</span>ing window follows its master between workspaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Like modal windows, <span class="type">float</span>ing windows don't appear in the Workspaces
application.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span class="type">float</span>ing window's master continues to look active while you're
using (mousing or typing in) the <span class="type">float</span>ing window itself.
</p></li></ul><p>
The split into look and feel should help us make windows more
configurable.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id673402"></a>The Window Flags Examined</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another change that you don't want to miss are these additions to the
window flags list:
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_AVOID_FRONT</code>: This flag tells the window manager to never "promote" the
window to active status when the current one disappears. You use this
flag for "background" windows. For example, if you activate a window
using <span class="application">Deskbar</span> and then close that window, you
probably don't want <span class="application">Deskbar</span>
to become active (which, in the old days, it would have due of its "next
most recent" status). In Release 3, <span class="application">Deskbar</span>
(and <span class="application">Workspaces</span>) set this
flag and so avoid being promoted to activity in just such situations.
(Note that you can still *explicitly activate* a window that's "avoiding
front," it just won't happen through promotion.)
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_AVOID_FOCUS</code>: This is used by windows (primarily <span class="type">float</span>ing windows) that
don't need keyboard input (i.e. that don't contain a "focus view"). By
avoiding focus, a <span class="type">float</span>ing window doesn't force you to re-click on the
master window after you've dismissed the <span class="type">float</span>er.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_OUTLINE_RESIZE</code>: Live resizing looks nice, but it generates a lot of
redrawing. If your interface looks bad and feels sluggish because of live
resizing, then <code class="constant">B_OUTLINE_RESIZE</code> can really help. It's not recommended,
but it's there if you need it.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_NOT_ANCHORED_ON_ACTIVATE</code>: When you activate a window that's in another
workspace (by using <span class="application">Deskbar</span> or the
<span class="application">Tracker</span>, for example), the window
manager will, by default, switch to that workspace. But that's not always
what you want. This flag tells the window manager to move the window into
the current workspace, thus avoiding the annoying "workspace shuffle."
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_NO_WORKSPACE_ACTIVATION</code>: This flag lets the window be activated in
another workspace without switching to that workspace. This flag was
designed to satisfy apps that spread a number of windows over various
workspaces when they start up. Tracker, for example, uses this flag.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id673515"></a>New Dynamic and Convenient Window API</h3></div></div></div><p>
These new looks, feels, and flags wouldn't be very useful if they were
only settable at construction time. The good news is that now all window
flags and attributes are settable on the fly:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">status_t</span>     <code class="methodname">SetType</code>(<span class="type">window_type</span> <code class="parameter">type</code>);
<span class="type">window_type</span>  <code class="methodname">Type</code>() const;

<span class="type">status_t</span>     <code class="methodname">SetLook</code>(<span class="type">window_look</span> <code class="parameter">look</code>);
<span class="type">window_look</span>  <code class="methodname">Look</code>() const;

<span class="type">status_t</span>     <code class="methodname">SetFeel</code>(<span class="type">window_feel</span> <code class="parameter">feel</code>);
<span class="type">window_feel</span>  <code class="methodname">Feel</code>() const;

<span class="type">status_t</span>     <code class="methodname">SetFlags</code>(<span class="type">uint32</span>);
<span class="type">uint32</span>       <code class="methodname">Flags</code>() const;
</pre><p>
For example, <span class="application">Tracker</span> set the
<code class="constant">B_NO_WORKSPACE_ACTIVATION</code> flag when it lays
out its windows at boot time, and then unsets the flag and sets
<code class="constant">B_NOT_ANCHORED_ON_ACTIVATE</code> to allow windows to come to you when
beckoned...
</p><p>
Also for your convenience, a couple functions were added:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">bool</span>      <code class="methodname">IsModal</code>() const;
<span class="type">bool</span>      <code class="methodname">IsFloating</code>() const;
<span class="type">void</span>      <code class="methodname">Sync</code>();
<span class="type">status_t</span>  <code class="methodname">SendBehind</code>(<span class="type">const<code class="classname">BWindow</code> *</span><code class="parameter">window</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="methodname">Sync()</code> ensures that all asynchronous window operations have completed.
It's useful after calls such as <code class="methodname">Hide()</code>
and <code class="methodname">Show()</code>.
</p><p>
(This function is a replacement for <code class="methodname">ShowSync()</code>, although the
compatibility isn't complete.) <code class="methodname">SendBehind()</code> is a nicety that was added to
give you a little more control on window ordering. The current window
will be moved "just behind" the one you specify. Also, in the same
spirit, we implemented a nifty "second button title bar click" that will
send the window as far back as possible. This allows you to easily
uncover other windows, in one click, and without having to close the
window in front of them.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id673724"></a>Window Content Area Alignment</h3></div></div></div><p>
New API was added to control the alignment of the window content rect.
It's typically useful for people wanting to do DMA on screen through
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>s (as described in next week's article), but it can also be
helpful in some other cases.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
enum <span class="type">window_alignment</span> {
  <code class="constant">B_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</code>     = 0,
  <code class="constant">B_PIXEL_ALIGNMENT</code>    = 1
};

<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="methodname">SetWindowAlignment</code>(<span class="type">window_alignment</span> <code class="parameter">mode</code>,
                <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">x</code>,
                <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">xOffset</code> = 0,
                <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">width</code> = 0,
                <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">widthOffset</code> = 0,

                <span class="type">int32 *</span><span class="type">xOffset</span> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>,

                <span class="type">int32 *</span><code class="parameter">heightOffset</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>) const;
</pre><p>
In <code class="constant">B_PIXEL_ALIGNMENT</code> mode, window moving and resizing will snap to
independent "pixel grids." For example, you can tell a window to move in
5 pixel increments, and resize in 7 pixel increments at the same time:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">SetWindowAlignment</code>(<code class="constant">B_PIXEL_ALIGNMENT</code>,
                    5, 0, <span class="comment">// x origin increment</span>
                    7, 0, <span class="comment">// width increment</span>
                    5, 0, <span class="comment">// y origin increment</span>
                    7, 0);  <span class="comment">// height increment</span>
</pre><p>
You can "elongate" either grid; here we tell a window to move in 5 pixel
increments horizontally, 6 pixels vertically, and to resize in 7 pixel
increments horizontally and 8 pixels vertically:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">SetWindowAlignment</code>(<code class="constant">B_PIXEL_ALIGNMENT</code>,
                    5, 0, <span class="comment">// x origin increment</span>
                    7, 0, <span class="comment">// width increment</span>
                    6, 0, <span class="comment">// y origin increment</span>
                    8, 0);  <span class="comment">// height increment</span>
</pre><p>
(The intervening parameters let you offset the grids with respect to the
screen origin.) The <code class="constant">B_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</code> aligns the window's content area
within the frame buffer. It's effective on the x origin and the width
only. The dimensions of the grid that byte alignment yields in pixels
depends on the frame buffer's depth. For example, with a setting of...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">SetWindowAlignment</code>(<code class="constant">B_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</code>,
                    4, 0,   <span class="comment">// x origin increment</span>
                    0, 0);  <span class="comment">// width increment</span>
</pre><p>
...the window's origin would snap to every 4 pixels in 8 bpp, every 2 in
16 bpp, and every pixel in 32 bpp. It's very useful to be able to align a
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> that's doing <acronym class="acronym">DMA</acronym>
or direct access. When <code class="constant">B_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</code> is
set, the vertical origin and the height can still be aligned, but they
will be controlled by <code class="constant">B_PIXEL_ALIGNMENT</code> mode, as byte alignment doesn't
make any sense on the vertical axis.

As any good rewrite should do, we came up with a cleaner and stronger
architecture than before, so we tried to use it to perfect the
implementation of focus follows mouse. This time, the result seemed good
enough to become a public option, so you will notice a new checkbox in
the Mouse preference panel. The main principles are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Having the focus means being the main receiver for keyboard events.
(The yellow title bar indicates the focused window.)
</p></li><li><p>
If the window pointed at by the mouse accepts focus and isn't blocked
by any modal window, then it will get the focus. Focus is updated in
real time after any window changes or cursor moves.
</p></li><li><p>
If the window is a <span class="type">float</span>ing window that doesn't accept focus, then
the focus goes to its frontmost master window, if any is currently
visible. If there are no visible master, focus stays where it was
before.
</p></li><li><p>
Sending focus to a non-front window will *not* display that window's
<span class="type">float</span>ers. This was done to avoid excessive window flashing while
dragging the mouse across the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
You can move a background window without bringing it to the front by
dragging its title bar or border.
</p></li></ul><p>
But even better than reading this article, just try to play with it and
you'll get it. It's hard at first, but probably more efficient than the
old way once you get used to it. In any case, it's just an option...

Now, for those of you who are interested in more details about how the
new window manager really works, here are the sourc-- (Oops sorry :-)
here are a few details:
</p><p>
Windows are sorted into 9 layers of visibility; a window in a higher
layer is displayed in front of a window in a lower layer (e.g., a layer 5
window is display in front of a layer 4 window):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
layer 0 - hidden windows (including Workspaces visibility).
</p></li><li><p>
layer 1 - minimized windows.
</p></li><li><p>
layer 2 - background window (the desktop of the Tracker).
</p></li><li><p>
layer 3 - "normal" document windows (i.e., windows that aren't in any
other category).
</p></li><li><p>
layer 4 - <span class="type">float</span>ing windows attached to the current frontmost window.
</p></li><li><p>
layer 5 - modal windows blocking the current frontmost window.
</p></li><li><p>
layer 6 - system-wide modal windows.
</p></li><li><p>
layer 7 - system-wide <span class="type">float</span>ing windows.
</p></li><li><p>
layer 8 - full-screen windows (from the Game Kit).
</p></li></ul><p>
Some rules:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The first 2 layers are not drawn for now (that could change for layer
1 in the future).
</p></li><li><p>
If a group of windows switches from one layer to another layer in the
same transaction (workspace switch for example), the windows stay in
the same order relative to each other.
</p></li><li><p>
A window that's demoted from a higher layer to a lower layer is added
to the front of the lower layer.
</p></li><li><p>
A window that's promoted to a higher layer is added to the back of
that layer, except...
</p></li><li><p>
A window that's being activated is sent to the very front of the
layer.
</p></li><li><p>
Only one window can be in layer 8 at any time.
</p></li></ul><p>
To select focus and window activation, windows respect the following
rules, in order of priority:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
the ordering rules given above are always enforced first
</p></li><li><p>
a window in layer 8 always gets the focus and is the only active
window.
</p></li><li><p>
A window in layer 0 or 1 is never a potential focus nor is it ever
active
</p></li><li><p>
a visible <span class="type">float</span>ing window is always active.
</p></li><li><p>
A window that refuses focus is never a potential focus.
</p></li><li><p>
User interaction (using focus_follows_mouse or not) will select new
windows as potential focus. If the chosen window is a non system- wide
<span class="type">float</span>ing window and doesn't accept focus, then its frontmost master
window is selected as a potential focus.
</p></li><li><p>
Programmatic API calls like Show() will bring a window to front,
making it a potential focus. Other API may affect the process in their
own way.
</p></li><li><p>
A workspace change cancels the last focus owner.
</p></li><li><p>
If the last focus owner has not been canceled by a workspace change,
it's automatically a potential focus.
</p></li><li><p>
If the frontmost potential focus is a system-wide modal, then it's
the focus and the only active window.
</p></li><li><p>
If the frontmost potential focus is a <span class="type">float</span>ing window, then it's the
focus. Also, its frontmost master window is active.
</p></li><li><p>
If the frontmost potential focus is blocked by a modal, then the
topmost modal blocking that window is the focus and the only active
window.
</p></li><li><p>
If the frontmost potential focus is not blocked by a modal, then its
the focus and the only active window.
</p></li><li><p>
If there is no potential focus, then the frontmost window that is not
a system-wide <span class="type">float</span>er and doesn't dislike becoming front is brought to
front and set as a potential focus, and all rules are applied again.
</p></li><li><p>
If there is no potential focus, then the frontmost window is brought
to front and set as a potential focus, and all rules are applied again.
</p></li><li><p>
There is no focus, nor any active window.
</p></li></ul><p>
Hmmm, I probably forgot a couple details, but mainly that's it.
</p><p>
Finally, the last advantage, but not the least, of the new window manager
architecture is that now all changes of state that are triggered by a
single external stimulus (user interaction or programmatic API call) is
processed in one atomic transaction. That was the key feature that
allowed an efficient implementation of <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>. But that's next
week's story...

http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue95.html#Insight2, I described
a few of my favorite things in the BeOS Preview Release 2. By a great
stroke of luck, my latest article deadline coincides almost perfectly
with the current BeOS release, Release 3, saving me the agony of finding
a new topic to write about.
</p><p>
My favorite thing in Release 3 is <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>. In a nutshell, it's an
extension to the Game Kit that allows extremely processor-efficient
direct access to the graphics card frame buffer. It makes video and
animation—full screen or in a window—smoother, without soaking up
all your processor's power. Streaming video from a digitizing card or
from a hard drive is very smooth and efficient; I predict that all of the
BeOS' &amp;tractor&amp; applications will use <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>.
</p><p>
Pierre Raynaud-Richard will describe it in greater detail in next week's
Newsletter, so I'll leave it by saying that if you're coming to the BeDC,
you'll see <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>'s advantages demonstrated in the Media Kit
Overview and in Pierre's presentation on <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>. Be sure you see
one or both!
</p><p>
A number of <span class="application">Tracker</span> improvements tickle my fancy. Probably the coolest is
what happens when you right-click on a Query. In the context menu, you
can &amp;open&amp; the query in the submenu, just as you can by right-clicking on
a folder. What's new is that the Query is live—it executes before
displaying the menu.
</p><p>
I'm sure you can think of a few clever tricks for this. Here's one of
mine (and I'm going to cheat, and reuse it in this week's Tip of the
Week):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Create a new Query, by searching for Bookmark by Attribute; size is
0.
</p><p>
You want to search on this specific criterion, because it will find
all your NetPositive bookmarks very quickly. You could search for all
Bookmarks by searching for Name is * (wildcard), but that goes much
more slowly.
</p></li><li><p>
Find the Query you just created in your
<code class="filename">/home/queries</code> directory.
Rename it something like &amp;Bookmarks&amp;. Move it to your desktop, or any
place that's convenient.
</p></li><li><p>
Now all your favorite web sites are just a right-click away. Just
right-click on the Query on your desktop, select the URL, and away you
go!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The <span class="guimenuitem">Open With</span> menu is pretty nice, too. This new feature lets you open
your documents with any application which is capable of opening the
file's type, not just the default application that opens when you
<span class="type">double</span>-click the file. I use this most when editing and testing HTML
documents, going back and forth between Eddie (a cool text editor) and
<span class="application">NetPositive</span>.
</p><p>
It's not strictly a <span class="application">Tracker</span> improvement, but I love the new status area
in the <span class="application">Deskbar</span>. You know how the mail_daemon adds the mailbox icon to the
status area at the bottom of the Deskbar? Well, now any application can
add a Replicant to that area, providing it's small enough and there's
room left (the status area is not resizable, so there's limited real
estate—we'll probably fix this in R4).
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym" title="Point to Point Protocol">PPP</acronym> status
is a natural, and we've got a very-mini-<span class="application">Pulse</span>, uh, thingie
here, too. I'll bet it'll be a matter of weeks before there are dozens of
choices of what to add to this area. Get there fast!
</p><p>
Two of our Internet applications got big improvements. <span class="application">NetPositive</span> now
does frames, has a bunch of bugs fixed, is faster at some things, and
opens Bookmark files from the <span class="application">Tracker</span>
correctly. <span class="application">PoorMan</span> got a totally
new interface, one that I think is a great improvement. It's now a very
usable personal web server. Maybe we should rename it!
</p><p>
Of course, the biggest thing in Release 3 is support for Intel hardware.
It was a huge amount of work, but the result is that the BeOS now runs on
the two most popular computer platforms on the planet.
</p><p>
One of the things that gets me really jazzed about running on Intel
hardware is the cost of the systems. We've put together some example
systems, known affectionately as &amp;Ming Specials,&amp; that can give you an
idea of the hardware values available today. You can check out all three
Ming Specials on our web site at:
http://www.be.com/support/guides/ming-specials.html
</p><p>
Here's the system that really rouses my enthusiasm, because it represents
600 MHz of screaming silicon for just over $2,500. You can't get that
anywhere except on a PC, and you can't take advantage of both processors
with any other operating system like you can with the BeOS:
</p><pre class="screen">
Ming Special #3—$2,539

  Tyan S-1692DL Dual Pentium II motherboard
  Dual Intel Pentium II 300 MHz CPU
  128 MB SDRAM memory
  Western Digital 6.4 GB Ultra IDE hard drive
  Toshiba 32x CD-ROM drive
  Sony 1.44 floppy disk drive
  Matrox Millennium II 4 MB video card
  Keytronic 104 PS/2 keyboard
  Logitec 3-button Combo Mouseman
  ATX Mid-tower case w/ 230 W power supply
</pre><p>
What's most exciting to me is that just four months ago this system cost
$3,154 (and had a smaller hard drive). That's a price drop of $615, over
$150 a month! Is it any wonder this is one of my favorite things?
</p><p>
Release 3 will be shipping soon, and when you get your hands on it, be
sure to tell us what *your* favorite things are.

I've got my own database files that contain a hogshead of custom
attributes. I indexed the attributes before adding them to the files
(just like the good book told me to do), and I have my own app that
creates new attributed files, modifies the attributes as needed, and
deletes old files. The thing it doesn't do—and that I don't want to
have to write—is simply *display* the attributes. I want Tracker to
recognize and display my attributes in its windows, like it does for
e-mail. How do I do this?—Jean-Phillipe Toussaud de Renard Sousa
Flaxhandle, Louisiana
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Tres bon interrogation, garcon. But before we give you an answer,
let's make sure that you're up on the latest Be Book-as-disinformation
news (regarding attributes and queries):
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The (pre-Release 3) Be Book erroneously reported that ONLY indexed
attributes can be queried. The truth is that a query must include at
least ONE indexed attribute, but it can search for any number of other,
unindexed attributes. Of course, the unindexed search won't be as fast as
the indexed search, but the indexed search is performed first, which
should, in many cases, sufficiently narrow the domain for the unindexed
search. What this means for you, M. de Renard Sousa, is that you might
want to reconsider the "hogshead of custom attributes" that you currently
have indexed. You might want to unindex the attributes that you don't
ever use in a query (or that you rarely use).
</p><p>
Also, note that if the length of the value of an indexed attribute
exceeds 255 bytes, it will fall out of the index. The value itself won't
be lost (the attribute will retain the prolix value), but the index will
no longer "see" that attribute. This little fact was also neglected in
the Be Book, and has since been corrected (thanks to an astute BeDevTalk
participant).
</p><p>
But back to the original question. What Jean-Phillipe wants to do is
safe, easy, and uncontroversial, even in states with a stricter
definition of acceptable leisure activity than Louisiana. Here's the full
story on "How To Get Tracker to See Your Attributes":
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Create some attributes. (Jean-Phillipe has already done this, but
we're starting from scratch.) To "create" an attribute, you simply
write it to a file through <code class="classname">BNode</code>'s
<code class="methodname">WriteAttr()</code> function; you can get
the details from the Be Book, but here's a wee example:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">aFile</code>.<code class="methodname">WriteAttr</code>("SOUSA:Name", <code class="constant">B_STRING_TYPE</code>, 0, "Bub", 4);
</pre><p>
Note that we write the <code class="constant">NULL</code> terminator by declaring the data length to
be <code class="function">strlen()</code>+1. Tracker depends on this <code class="constant">NULL</code> termination.
</p></li><li><p>
Create a <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> type for your files and install it in the system-wide
<acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> type database. You do this through <code class="classname">BMimeType</code>'s
<code class="methodname">Install()</code>
function. You may want to check to see if it's already installed
before installing it:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMimeType</code> <code class="varname">mime</code>("text/x-Sousa");
if (!<code class="varname">mime</code>.<code class="methodname">IsInstalled</code>())
  <code class="varname">mime</code>.<code class="methodname">Install</code>();
</pre></li><li><p>
Assign the file type to the files you create. You do this through
<code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code>'s <code class="methodname">SetType()</code> function:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code> <code class="varname">ni</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">aFile</code>);
<code class="varname">ni</code>.<code class="methodname">SetType</code>("text/x-Sousa");
</pre></li><li><p>
Now here's the part that you really want to know about: The <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym>
info that <span class="application">Tracker</span> looks for when compiling column candidates.
Unfortunately, the names of the <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> info fields aren't currently
published (when we do publish them, we'll undoubtedly provide handy
constants and all that) so what I'm about to disclose is a BIG SECRET.
If you agree to change your code to the published names when that day
comes, you can continue reading. If you can't hold yourself to this
little promise, then go over there for awhile; I'll let you know when
you can rejoin us.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Here's what Tracker looks for (or some of it, anyway):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
"attr:name"<br />
The name of some attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:public_name"<br />
The name you want Tracker to call this attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:type"<br />
The type (<code class="constant">B_INT32_TYPE</code>,
<code class="constant">B_STRING_TYPE</code>, etc.) of the attribute data.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:viewable"<br />
A <span class="type">bool</span> that you set to <code class="constant">true</code> if you want
<span class="application">Tracker</span> to display the
attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:editable"<br />
A <span class="type">bool</span> that you set to <code class="constant">true</code> if
you want users to be able to edit the attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:width"<br />
An <span class="type">int32</span> that gives the width of a default column, in units of
something. Probably pixels.
</p></li><li><p>
"attr:alignment"<br />
A code (<code class="constant">B_ALIGN_LEFT</code>, <code class="constant">...RIGHT</code>,
or <code class="constant">...CENTER</code>) that declares how the
values are aligned in the <span class="application">Tracker</span> column.
</p></li></ul><p>
You bundle this information into a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, and tack the message onto a
<acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> type through <code class="classname">BMimeType</code>'s
<code class="methodname">SetAttrInfo()</code> function.
</p><p>
For example, let's say our Jean-Phillipe wants Tracker to exhibit—and
allow editing of—the "SOUSA:Name" values of his "text/x-Sousa" files,
but he wants the (attribute) column to be named "Sousa Name". He would do
something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">msg</code>;
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddString</code>("attr:name", "SOUSA:Name");
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddString</code>("attr:public_name", "Sousa Name");
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddInt32</code>("attr:type", <code class="constant">B_STRING_TYPE</code>);
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddBool</code>("attr:viewable", <code class="constant">true</code>);
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddBool</code>("attr:editable", <code class="constant">true</code>);
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddInt32</code>("attr:width", 50);
<code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddInt32</code>("attr:alignment", <code class="constant">B_ALIGN_LEFT</code>);

<span class="comment">/* 'mime' is the BMimeType from above */</span>
<code class="varname">mime</code>.<code class="methodname">SetAttrInfo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">msg</code>);
</pre><p>
The message fields correspond to a particular attribute purely by index
into the message. In other words, the 0'th "attr:public_name" field
corresponds to the 0'th "attr:name" field (and so on for the other
fields). If you want to add Tracker-recognized parameters for a second
attribute, you add a second set of "attr:*" values AFTER you've added the
first set. (Admittedly, this isn't a very flexible interface, but this is
all under-the-counter stuff anyway, so stop griping.)
</p><p>
That's it. Note that...
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
We didn't mention indexing. That's because none of this depends on
indexing: You can ask Tracker to display ANY attribute, indexed or not.
</p></li><li><p>
The order of these operations isn't important. You can do them in the
reverse order and it will come to the same thing.
</p></li></ul><p>
The rest of you can come back now.

Last week I recounted some of our teething pains with the Intel Release 3
release of the BeOS, the product we'll discuss at great length starting
Thursday at our Be DC developer's conference in Santa Clara. This week, I
know a little bit more about one of the problems we encountered, and even
have some good news, courtesy of Garrett Gruener, the courageous Be, Inc.
director who watched the BeOS installation vaporize data on his spouse's
hard disk. Fortunately, the data was not really destroyed, only
transmogrified into FAT 32 files, and thereby made incomprehensible to a
version of Windows only fluent in the DOS FAT 16 standard.
</p><p>
We know now the metamorphosis is easily reversed: you just tell the
partitioning utility to do it. In fact, if you use the aptly named Deluxe
version of System Commander, it tells you about the FAT 16 vs. FAT 32
problem and indicates the right procedure. In my opinion, System
Commander is the best boot manager in the business. The Deluxe version
comes with a good set of partitioning tools offering a one-stop complete
solution for the hardy multiple OS explorer. Not surprisingly, Frank van
Gilluwe, one of the founders of V Communications, System Commander's
publisher, is also the author of "The Undocumented PC," a highly
recommended book for the fearless experimenters just mentioned.
</p><p>
There is more good news. In discussing the problems BeOS users might face
or fear when repartitioning their hard disk and installing the BeOS,
Garrett Gruener reminded me of a simple, executive-proof solution: one of
his companies, @Backup http://www.atbackup.com, makes a business of
backing up your data over the net, with a modem or a LAN connection.
Imagine your system automatically backed up every night. Effortless,
therefore effective.
</p><p>
On the BIOS front, the news isn't so good. We've discovered that the most
recent versions (ending in PO5, 06, and 07) of the BIOS on the Intel
Atlanta LX440 motherboard cause the installation problem I experienced
last week. If you have one of these motherboards, please check the BIOS
version before installing the BeOS. There are two ways to do this: you
can catch it during the boot process as it scrolls by; or you can enter
the set-up routine by pressing F2 early in the boot sequence, which
displays the BIOS revision string on the set-up utility's main screen.
</p><p>
Why didn't we discover the problem earlier? Because it didn't exist on
the motherboards we acquired a while ago for development and test
purposes. It only showed up on one of our latest purchases, which
happened to be for my use as the Intel Release 3 all-purpose guinea pig.
</p><p>
BIOS problems are a way of life in the Intel-based PC world. Intel's
excellent web site,
</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/">http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/</a>
</p><p>
provides support information on their motherboards and the conundrums
they may pose. In particular,
</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/al/al_bios.htm">http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/al/al_bios.htm</a>
</p><p>
gives details on the latest LX440 BIOS and a procedure for updating the
flash memory on your motherboard.
</p><p>
BIOS blues are not a new occurrence. In 1995, I bought an Atlantis
motherboard, installed Windows 95, and promptly encountered two problems.
First, the system insisted I had two mice, a serial mouse and a PS/2
mouse. Second, detecting what it diplomatically referred to as "legacy
sound hardware," it always insisted on several attempts each time I
reinstalled Windows 95 (a frequent occurrence in my early days of
exploring this product).
</p><p>
I learned that deleting one of the two mice made the system unstable, but
I got used to the idiosyncrasies. Later, I saw the BIOS update
information on the Intel site and, despite trepidation built on my proven
ability to find the wrong way to do something, I nevertheless succumbed
to the attraction of a manly undertaking sure to grow more hair on my
chest.
</p><p>
I downloaded the new BIOS, printed the instructions _before_ attempting
the update (I'm not that virile), made a boot floppy, copied the update
program on it, rebooted, followed instructions, rebooted and noted the
new BIOS revision string, reintroduced my old settings (don't forget to
write them down prior to the transplant), and my system looked intact.
</p><p>
Actually, it had healed: the phantom mouse had disappeared and the sound
hardware detection problem never manifested itself again. Flush with
success, I tried the same operation on a dual-processor Pentium Pro
system at the office. This procedure was a little more daunting when the
first reboot failed to restart the system, though another reset did the
trick. Unfortunately, that BIOS update didn't cure the instabilities
presented by my installation of NT 4.0. Sometimes it's the BIOS,
sometimes it's the system. And, of course, sometimes it's neither, or
both.
</p><p>
Back to Release 3 on Atlanta LX440 motherboards: please check the BIOS
revision and call or e-mail if you have one of the later P05, 06, or 07
revisions. We'll post more info on our web site this week. We have a fix
-- I'm writing on it, so to speak—and we want to make sure it is
well-tested and reasonably simple and safe to apply.

As my personal experiences testify, these problems are fairly prevalent
in the fast-evolving context of the PC architecture and its many
independent implementations. This early BIOS problem is a useful reminder
to be en garde for the negative consequences of well-meaning upgrades,
and of the need to work as closely as possible with BIOS companies such
as Phoenix and AMI.
