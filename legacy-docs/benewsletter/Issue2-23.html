(...The stranger stood up, but they still couldn't see his face. The
leader of the security team looked one last time at his boss before
taking action. But his gaze was fixed on the stranger, captivated. No
instruction. So he barked the order he had been holding back...
</p><p>
"FIR--"
</p><p>
A thin beam of energy shot up from the stranger's belt, widening with
distance to a tenth of an inch. It sliced diagonally through the neck of
the security leader. A final groan burbbled from his gaping throat, then
his body collapsed slowly; the head, neatly detached, rolled on the
ground...)
</p><p>
Perhaps the link to "Porting Font Code from DR8 to the Preview Release"
is not clear. But at least it's not just another boring introduction. So
first, let's go through a quick overview of the main API changes:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The font interface has been extracted from <code class="classname">BView</code> and put in its own
<code class="classname">BFont</code> class. The class gives you an easy way to keep track of different
font settings, and lets you ask for metric information without having
to create a <code class="classname">BView</code>. This model is much more efficient for serious text
drawing/editing, at the price of being a minor annoyance for people who
just want to do basic stuff.
</p></li><li><p>
The single font name is replaced by a name pair: The family name
(Courier, Times, etc.) and the style name (plain, bold, italic, etc.).
</p></li><li><p>
Three default, global <code class="classname">BFont</code> objects have been defined: <code class="varname">be_plain_font</code>,
<code class="varname">be_bold_font</code> and <code class="varname">be_fixed_font</code>. These abstract the most common "styles"
of font used inside a standard application. The definitions of these
fonts are set by the user, through the Font Preferences app. Apps
should use the default fonts rather than hard coded font names (as we
had been doing in DR8 with Erich, Emily and Kate). The values of the
default fonts are set when an app is launched; they won't change (for
that app) thereafter. To pick up new settings in an app, the user has
to quit and restart the app.
</p></li></ul><p>
Let's give more details about <code class="classname">BView</code> and <code class="classname">BFont</code>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id566342"></a>What Happened To BView</h3></div></div></div><p>
What happened to <code class="classname">BView</code> is quite simple: Almost all the font related
functions have been moved (and in some cases modified or enhanced) to the
<code class="classname">BFont</code> class. Here are the functions that have moved:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">GetCharEscapement</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">GetCharEdges</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">GetFontInfo</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">SetFontName</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">SetFontRotation</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">SetFontShear</code>(...)
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">SetSymbolSet</code>(...)
</pre><p>
A logical exception, <code class="classname">BView</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">DrawChar(...)</code> is unchanged, and
<code class="classname">BView</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">DrawString(...)</code> is just slightly enhanced with the introduction of
<span class="type">escapements_delta</span>. Those optional parameters define an additional
escapement, different for space characters and non-space characters,
allowing easy justification of a full line of text.
</p><p>
We were reluctant to force everyone to use the <code class="classname">BFont</code> API for every single
font-related operation, so we decided to keep a subset of the <code class="classname">BFont</code> API
in <code class="classname">BView</code>. Specifically, <code class="methodname">StringWidth()</code>
and <code class="methodname">GetFontHeight()</code> are retained so
that you can easily get the dimensions of the rect used by a string.
Additionally, <code class="methodname">SetFontSize()</code> was so commonly used that we decided to keep
it in <code class="classname">BView</code> as well.
</p><p>
All other font setting changes must be done by modifying the <code class="classname">BView</code>'s
<code class="classname">BFont</code> object; you use <code class="methodname">GetFont()</code>
and <code class="methodname">SetFont()</code> to access and set the
object.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id566501"></a>BFont Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>
Here are the standard properties of the new <code class="classname">BFont</code> API:
</p><p>
Family and Style names: you can get the complete list from global
functions:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="function">count_font_families</code>()
<code class="function">get_font_family</code>(index, &amp;font_family)
<code class="function">count_font_styles</code>(font_family)
<code class="function">get_font_style</code>(font_family, index, &amp;font_style).
</pre><p>
The list of families is cached for each application after the first use.
As the user is allow to add and remove fonts files at any time, this list
could change at any time. But, for technical reasons—and because the
user really shouldn't be changing the font all that much anyway—this
list is not updated automatically in the Preview Release.
</p><p>
You can force a "font update" by calling:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="function">update_font_families</code>(<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">check_only</code>)
</pre><p>
If <code class="parameter">check_only</code> is <code class="constant">TRUE</code>, the function
lets you know (through the return
value) if the global font list has changed, but it doesn't actually
update your app's version of the list. If <code class="parameter">check_only</code>
is <code class="constant">FALSE</code>, it will go
ahead and update your app, if necessary. Updating can take a long time,
and it blocks the calling thread, so the "check only" option gives your
app a chance to put up a warning to the user, or spawn a thread to do the
updating in the background.
</p><p>
The list of styles can be different (and usually is) for each different
family. A lot of different names exist for something representing the
same "style." For example, plain is often called "roman" or "regular."
Because of this, family and style should always be set at the same time,
in one call:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BFont</code>::<code class="methodname">SetFamilyAndStyle</code>(<span class="type">constfont_family</span>,
                         <span class="type">constfont_style</span>)
</pre><p>
Nevertheless, if you just want to change the style of the current family,
you pass <code class="constant">NULL</code> as the family. Or if you just want to select the "standard"
style of a font (the plain equivalent, if available), you pass <code class="constant">NULL</code> as
the style.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Size: In points, any positive floating-point value smaller than
10,000. The global <code class="classname">BFont</code> objects have individual default sizes.
</p></li><li><p>
Rotation: In degrees, with a default value of 0.
</p></li><li><p>
Shear: In degrees, in the range [45, 135] with a default value of 90.
</p></li><li><p>
Encoding: This is the character set encoding used to describe
characters when talking with the font engine. The BeOS should use only
<code class="constant">B_UNICODE_UTF8</code> (the default value) for now. Other encodings may be
supported later.
</p></li><li><p>
Encoding: This is the character set encoding used to describe
characters when talking to the font engine. The BeOS should use only
<code class="constant">B_UNICODE_UTF8</code> (the default value) for now. A small set of standard 8
bit encodings are also supported for compatibility (ISO-8859-1 to 10,
and Macintosh Roman).
</p></li><li><p>
Spacing_mode: This parameter was described in great detail in the
previous newsletter.
</p></li><li><p>
Faces: This parameter is currently reserved for future extensions,
such as underline or strikethrough.
</p></li><li><p>
Flags: This controls the selection of special options. The only one
available for now is <code class="constant">B_DISABLE_ANTI_ALIASING</code>. Furthermore,
anti-aliasing should ONLY be turned off by the rare application that
displays monocolor bitmap fonts in large point sizes.
</p></li></ul><p>
When using <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">SetFont()</code>,
you can set a subset of these parameters by
using the <code class="parameter">setting_mask</code>. This gives you two
ways modify a <code class="classname">BView</code>'s font
setting:
</p><p>
A. <code class="methodname">GetFont()</code> -&gt; modify the parameter -&gt; <code class="methodname">SetFont()</code>
</p><p>
B. Set the parameter in a dummy <code class="classname">BFont</code> object -&gt;
<code class="methodname">SetFont()</code> using a setting
flag to modify only this parameter
</p><p>
Typically, A is written in 3 lines of code, B in only 2.

And you will find much more in future sample code.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id567330"></a>Drawing Modes</h3></div></div></div><p>
The last thing I want to talk about is a small but very important detail:
The first two drawing modes used in the <code class="classname">BView</code> (COPY and OVER) were
equivalent for text in DR8. That's no longer the case in the Preview
Release. And the bad thing is that an incorrect usage of those modes will
make the anti-aliasing look REALLY BAD. So please, read the following
carefully and update your code if necessary.
</p><p>
BEFORE: Both COPY and OVER were basically doing what the OVER mode was
supposed to do. Their performance was similar, and many people used one
or the other without seeing any real difference on the screen.
</p><p>
NOW: The mode OVER reads the background before drawing, as the
anti-aliasing is done using alpha blending. But, depending on the user
configuration, the cost of reading back the frame buffer of the graphic
card can be prohibitive.
</p><p>
This is where the COPY mode shows the power of its simplified definition:
By computing the alpha-blending between the HighColor of the glyph itself
and the LowColor of the <code class="classname">BView</code> (which represents the color of the uniform
background), COPY is much faster than OVER. However, you can only use
COPY on a uniform background, and you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE THE
LOWCOLOR SET PROPERLY (it's the responsibility of the programmer).
</p><p>
I hope you understand now why many quick ports from DR8 to the Preview
Release (probably including a few apps of our own) displayed ugly looking
anti-aliased fonts here and there...
</p><p>
Here's another good reason to use the fast COPY mode as much as possible:
Fonts never erase their background (for the simple reason that there is
no consistent way to define the limits of the background of a character).
Consequently, the programmer is responsible for erasing the background
properly before calling DrawBitmap.
</p><p>
For example, let's say you just want to change the color of &gt;&gt;the font;
you may be tempted to just redraw the text in the new color, thinking it
will overwrite the previously drawn text (some Be engineers were doing
that). This was true in both modes (COPY and OVER) in DR8.
</p><p>
With the Preview Release, it's still true in COPY mode, but doesn't work
anymore in OVER mode: The rasterizer will use the already anti-aliased
background, increasing the amount of anti-aliasing with each redraw,
until it reaches a saturation point. This doesn't look good at all (the
poor guinea pigs who got the alpha version of Advanced Access probably
remember the ugly text in menubars).
</p><p>
To conclude these two articles on the new font engine, I would say there
are still many areas that could be improved in terms of both quality and
performance. Be assured that we're thinking about it, but improvements
probably won't be published before the next release. In the meantime, I
will be happy to answer any other questions at: pierre@be.com.

Welcome back to our discussion about sailing towards technical support
Nirvana. This week I'll share some thoughts on outsourcing, and on how to
maximize the satisfaction of your customers while holding down support
costs.
</p><p>
Let's recap the last "Sailing to Support Nirvana" article before we
start. I discussed piloting your own day-sailer with a limited support
staff, and captaining a larger organization that provided "soup to nuts"
support to your customers. We explored a formula that showed the base
cost of handling contacts and a method of that black magic art,
forecasting contact volume. Let's reproduce here the chart we used,
because the result (cost of each support contact) will be important to
our discussion of outsourcing:
</p><pre class="screen">
** Chart 1 **

Personnel cost (per person)...................$100,000
Number of contacts handled/day/person...............30
Number of people.....................................2
Efficiency factor..................................0.8
Number of work days................................260
Calls handled/person/year.........................6240
Cost per contact................................$16.03
</pre><p>
I'd like to start off with an exploration of the controversy over whether
or not to outsource. Believe me, I have been all over the map on this
one. Five years ago, I was a major opponent of outsourcing. I felt that
we would lose control over the quality of information provided to our
customers. I mean, who understood our products better than the people who
had supported them for years? How could an outside company ever gain
enough knowledge to effectively support our beloved products? Over the
years, I have changed my position almost 100 percent. I've seen
outsourcing work in the US, Japan and Europe.
</p><p>
The secret is to realize that outsourcing is not a panacea. Some (less
than successful) companies think that they can outsource and forget. They
outsource and never have to worry about that work again. After all, isn't
that the work which they are contracting for? Well, yes, however you must
keep management control over the outsource vendor. A strong vendor
manager, someone who knows the support business and is excellent at
managing projects, is essential for the success of an outsourcing
project. The thing you are really contracting for is the "production
line" work of answering the questions.
</p><p>
Another requirement is that there must be someone inside the company to
handle the calls escalated from the first-line people. Remember those
first two sailors you brought aboard to help sail your original sloop?
Those guys and gals are now invaluable at teaching your new vendor the
ropes, and they are there to serve as the masters of escalation. This not
only makes effective use of your higher paid resources, but also allows
for job enrichment for those poor swabs who have been slogging away,
answering the first-level questions.
</p><p>
What is your involvement in all of this? You own the fleet. You have
contracted with a company to provide the sails and the manpower. You are
setting the course and determining the cargo to carry; that is, what is
supported, and how it is supported. You keep an eye on the fleet, making
sure your customers are satisfied, and your ships don't run aground. You
take soundings with a regular customer survey, and you make course
corrections based on what your customers are telling you.
</p><p>
You may be asking whether this outsourcing is more expensive than growing
your support capacity in-house. I'll share some of the pricing I've seen
in the recent past. I must admit that I've changed some of the numbers to
protect the guilty, but the numbers in Chart 2 below reflect bids you
might receive if you were to ask for quotes from some of the larger
outsource vendors:
</p><pre class="screen">
** Chart 2 **

Sample outsource quote—8 minute call (10 x 5 support)

Contacts/   Team     Price/     Price/
     Day    Size    Minute    Contact

      50       3     $1.70     $13.60
     100       5     $1.40     $11.20
     150       7     $1.30     $10.40
     200       8     $1.15     $ 9.20
     250      10     $1.10     $ 8.80
     300      11     $1.05     $ 8.40
     450      14     $0.99     $ 7.92
</pre><p>
This chart needs some explanation. The assumptions are listed at the top,
and the chart assumes that the average telephone call will be 8 minutes
in length (a good assumption for software contacts with reasonably
sophisticated users). It also assumes that you are accepting contacts
from 8am to 6pm (10 hours a day), Monday through Friday (five days a
week).
</p><p>
The "Price per Minute" and "Price per Contact" are figures that the
outsource company gives you to say "this is what it will cost you." You
may remember that I came up with a cost per contact of $16.03 when I did
the calculation for in-house staff. That makes sense; you are paying
those "fully loaded costs" and you have very little economy of scale with
just a few support people. You also want to pay more for your internal or
"institutional" knowledge keepers. In this scenario, you are going to use
your internal people as information resources, and as second level
support resources—natural tasks for higher cost people.
</p><p>
Now, what does all this mean? The decision that needs to be made regards
the point at which it makes sense to outsource, rather than grow your
support resources inside the company. You will need internal support
resources for higher level support, the "Masters" or "Chiefs" on your
boat. The crew can be pressed from outside and it makes sense to do so
when the volume of your contacts (calls and email) grows beyond the
capacity of your core of support engineers. This "break point" will be
unique to your circumstance.
</p><p>
The only advice I can give is to look at the ability to scale up Customer
Support as your product sells and grows in complexity. This lack of
ability to scale up without astronomical costs has crippled many
companies. In today's business environment, keeping core strengths within
the company, and outsourcing everything else is the winning solution.
</p><p>
Outsourcing is never the easy way out. As I've said, I've done it a few
times, and I am (obviously) not shy about sharing my thoughts and
opinions. If you are considering this route for technical support and
need someone off whom to bounce ideas, I'd be happy to help. Here at Be,
we are also looking at various scenarios where we can establish a
framework for support (and printing, packaging and distribution for that
matter) while allowing our developers to join in and enjoy some of the
benefits of the economy of scale. If you are interested in discussing
that concept, I'd be happy to help with that as well.
</p><p>
In the Be Newsletter #72, I invoked the ghost of Mayor Koch and asked for
feedback on our support of your efforts. I am still interested. How are
we doing? It's romson@be.com.

Pssstt... Hey buddy. Come here. I've got a secret for you. Have you ever
walked into a fine jewelry shop in the dark and tried to find the crown
jewels? Well, to continue our barrage of sample and useful documentation,
I submit to you a little tool to help you do your best. There are quite a
few ways to deal with images in the world. There is the Datatypes
library, there are resource files, and there is the Rraster application.
</p><p>
Rraster and Datatypes allow you to at run-time read in any image file of
any type the user so happens to have a codec for. The image resource
allows you to pack a known image in along with the executable so that
it's always there. Packing things into resources is a good way to go
because you can use one of the various resource editing tools like
InterfaceElements and IconWorld to manipulate them.
</p><p>
Another technique for getting images into your application is the
embedded graphic. That is, you do something like:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#define <code class="constant">width</code>   64
#define <code class="constant">height</code>  64
#define <code class="constant">cspace</code>  <code class="constant">B_RGB_32_BIT</code>
#define <code class="constant">bytesperpixel</code>  3

<span class="type">unsigned char</span> <code class="varname">bits</code>[] = {0,0,0,0,...};

<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">aRect</code>(0,0,<code class="constant">width</code>-1,<code class="constant">height</code>-1);
<code class="classname">BBitmap</code> <code class="varname">bitmap</code> = new <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">aRect</code>, <code class="constant">cspace</code>);
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">bytesperrow</code> = <code class="constant">bytesperpixel</code>*<code class="constant">width</code>;

for (<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">row</code>=0; <code class="varname">row</code>&lt;<code class="constant">height</code>; <code class="varname">row</code>++)
{
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">bitoffset</code> = <code class="varname">row</code>*<code class="constant">bytesperpixel</code>*<code class="constant">width</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">bitmapoffset</code> = <code class="varname">row</code>*<code class="varname">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BytesPerRow</code>();
  <code class="varname">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetBits</code>((<span class="type">char *</span>)<code class="varname">bits</code>+<code class="varname">bitsoffset</code>, <code class="constant">bytesperrow</code>,
    <code class="varname">bitmapoffset</code>, <code class="constant">cspace</code>);
}
</pre><p>
This is nifty if you have some sort of tool that allows you to convert
any image into an easy format which is simply a "C" structure. Well... we
have such a thing:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/mkimghdr.tgz
</p><p>
This little utility utilizes the codecs of the Rraster application to
turn just about any graphic into this useful format. The codecs that
shipped with the Advanced Access release were for Targa and Gif images.
There are a whole slew of new codecs for other formats that will show up
in the Preview Release. These include JFIF, TIFF, PCX, PBM, XBM, and PNG.
The same technique can be utilized with the Datatypes library. Thus for
all those codecs that everyone is hard at work producing for Datatypes,
you will be able to create simple "C" structures and include them in your
app. Of course, using Datatypes, there is already a "C" structure
Datatype, but there you have it.

You know, one thing about life with a 2 year old is that there is never a
dull moment. My current schedule gives me the night duty. That means,
from about 6:00pm until 9:30pm I'm in charge of entertaining and
eventually putting to bed a fiery bundle of joy. Well, how do you
entertain a 2 year old? Use the BeOS of course, but the mouse is a
horrible little rodent to be avoided at all costs, so do you prefer a
graphics tablet? I do. I've been playing with the Wacom tablets and
driver... Oops, did I say that? Well, nothing has changed in the system
to make it easy for any pointing device to show up as a mouse, but that
doesn't mean we can't play anyway:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/wacom.tgz
</p><p>
These tablets are neat things. They tell you positional and button
information like a mouse, but then there's things like proximity,
pressure and tilt. Somebody slap me with something killer using this
stuff please!! Oh, does that look like a device driver sample? Why yes it
is.

It's the beginning of summer. I have been told that VideoMania has been
bad to the pocket books of a few developers. That's a good thing. It's
this excitement to do neat things that drives the leapfrog development
cycle. Keep up the good work and we'll be inspired to pump out the killer
code to support you.

It looks like we averted a standards war with the new generation of 56
Kbps modems. The two-and-a-half warring factions managed to agree on
something without either directly agreeing or exactly knowing what they
agreed on. Trust me, I'll explain in a moment. Before doing so, I need to
disclose I'm a director of 3Com. The company has announced an agreement
to acquire US Robotics, one of the companies mentioned below.
</p><p>
The fight got off to an uglier start than usual. The previous generation
of 33.6 Kbps modems had seen a small scale attempt to preempt the
V.something standard with a V.Fast offering, but the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) ratified a norm soon enough for everyone
to quickly comply and customers to buy in peace.
</p><p>
Not so with the 56K generation. Last year, Rockwell, whose chips powered
about 80% of V.34 modems, announced their new K56Plus standard; AT&amp;T
announced their own V.flex2 and US Robotics their X2 modulation. Each one
with the firm intent of "owning" the new norm in the absence one
sanctioned by the ITU.
</p><p>
Rockwell announced first but USR quickly took the lead. Their strategy is
retroactively obvious: they figured out buyers needed to connect their
modem at the higher speed they were paying for. Before you e-mail me with
therapeutic advice for platitudinous thoughts, I beg you to consider what
USR did and their opposition didn't, or did much later.
</p><p>
USR preemptively "convinced" a number of ISPs, big and small, to announce
support, meaning access for X2 modems. Besides actually providing means
to instantiate the function customers were paying for, USR also wanted to
create a perception, they wanted a self-fulfilling prophecy. "We are
winning, join the winner and, as a result, we'll all win." Somehow, the
promoters of the other two standards never got around to such an
energetic unfurling of their standard. They agreed to make K56Plus and
V.flex2 "interoperable" (that's where the "two-and-a-half" above comes
from), thus reducing the confusion; but they were two or three months
behind USR in actually delivering modems to the retail channel.
</p><p>
Let's stop for a moment and look at the difference between USR and their
opponents. Lucent or Rockwell produce the technology, others adopt it and
make modems. A division of labor and energy. USR "makes" the technology
(Motorola disagrees, they say some of it comes from their patent
portfolio...) as well as the device. No division here, no questioning
whose job it is to promote the standard and whose it is to sell the
devices.
</p><p>
Still, there were potential losers in this war, not manufacturers, but
losers of the worst possible kind: customers, people with our money in
their pockets. What if the ITU, when a few million modems have already
been sold, decides for the "wrong" standard, meaning the "other one" my
modem and my ISP don't use? Worse, the ITU could decide to bless neither
K56Plus/V.flex2 nor X2.
</p><p>
Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, FUD, is usually deployed by the dominant
player against a pesky interloper when the latter threatens to take too
much business away from the former: don't buy this because it will become
obsolete, incompatible, or any such reason. In the case of 56K modems,
FUD worked against everyone because a third party, the ITU, holds the
keys to the norm.
</p><p>
As a result, the "double blind" agreement mentioned at the beginning
magically appeared in order to create peace of mind and more sales. Most
56K modem suppliers have independently or competitively come to offer a
guaranteed upgrade to the as yet unknown standard (see Motorola's and
USR's Web pages for examples of their guarantees). Hopefully, DSP
flexibility and software permitting, this isn't as bold as one might
think, but I always wince when the future is presented as "a mere matter
of software." And, somehow, I wonder if ISPs aren't, in fact, the primary
target of such promises. If ISPs refuse to take the plunge, the 56K
business will die once all people like me have bought one and found a
paucity of responding access points.
</p><p>
As we depend on Web marketing and delivery of application software, we're
happy to see one obstacle to faster downloads on its way to oblivion.
While we wait for the XDSL messiah, we'll continue to adore the good old
telephone system.
