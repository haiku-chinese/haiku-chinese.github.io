Spreading the Word II—another in my series of articles about making
MONEY developing applications for the BeOS.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id688704"></a>Visit Be and PC User Groups!</h3></div></div></div><p>
Developers—have you shown your application(s) to any user groups yet?
User groups are one of the best ways to spread the word about your
product.
</p><p>
Demonstrating your product to a user group accomplishes several desirable
goals:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You are informing users of your product's existence (and after the
demo they inform others).
</p></li><li><p>
You are showing them how it works and how they would use it.
</p></li><li><p>
You are learning from your potential customers what they want to
know. Often the question and answer period after your demonstration is
the most important part of your visit.
</p></li></ul><p>
When visiting a user group, bring you own computer with everything set up
and ready to go. You probably won't need a monitor, but ask ahead of time
just in case. Now I'll remind you of the obvious: once you set a date,
make sure you arrive with your demo well-prepared, machine fully tricked
out, goodies to give away, and so on. Bring one or more copies of your
product for a raffle. If you only sell online let them know that you'll
send the product to the winner(s). If you're demonstrating to a PC user
group instead of a Be user group let us know and we'll try to provide
some things, like T-shirts and copies of BeOS to raffle, to help you out.
</p><p>
There are now over 100 Be User Groups (BUGs) and they are eager to see
your products. They would be more than happy to arrange a meeting to show
a Be app. You can find them on the web at:
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/usergroups/usergroups.html.
</p><p>
Send them a note asking if you can be added to their schedule. If you
want more specific information about specific groups, contact
sylvie@be.com.
</p><p>
Don't limit yourself to Be user groups! PC user groups are not
necessarily Windows user groups and the BeOS runs on PCs. Everyone with a
Pentium is ultimately a potential customer for your BeOS application, so
it's a GREAT idea to look PC user groups and arrange to show them your
product. The BeOS runs on Intel architecture, which means that there are
a huge number of potential customers out there right now—but they
don't know about you yet! You can bring the news about the BeOS to these
groups by showing your product.
</p><p>
Here are some links to lists of PC user groups to check out:
</p><pre class="screen">
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.apcug.net/">http://www.apcug.net/</a>
http://www.user-groups.com/
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Organizations/User_Groups/">http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Organizations/User_Groups/</a>
</pre><p>
One more thing—remember my article on sending press releases? It's
also a good idea to send them to Be and PC user groups.

It's helpful to become familiar with the various BeOS-related web sites.
Check them out! Contact the people in charge and find out how to send
them news, articles, review copies, etc. A relationship with a news site
is a relationship with its readers.
</p><p>
Tip: Advertise! You get exposure and the web site gets support if you
place a banner ad on the web site!

Here's something I've been meaning to bring up for a while: Shareware
authors—consider selling your product as a commercial application
instead of shareware. Selling your product commercially through BeDepot
offers all the advantages of shareware with fewer disadvantages. Make
your product available at low cost, a "no-brainer" price, and you won't
believe how many you'll sell! The revenue can finance the next version,
maybe even enable you to quit your day job.
</p><p>
One of the main reasons for making a product available as shareware has
been the difficulty of collecting payment, especially using credit cards.
BeDepot &lt;http://www.bedepot.com/&gt; collects payments for you, and even
accepts credit cards. You just sit back and get checks.
</p><p>
Another typical reason for selling as shareware has been the difficulty
of delivering the product once it is ordered. You either have to print
manuals and boxes and duplicate disks, or send a large file (or ship a
package) when you get the order. BeDepot delivers the product
electronically for you.
</p><p>
So once again, I urge you to use BeDepot instead of trying to make money
through shareware. You'll make more, with less hassle.

Another place to gather and spread information is on newsgroups. Check
the Be newsgroups located at <a class="ulink" href="news:comp.sys.be.*">comp.sys.be.*</a>.
It isn't good manners to just
show up and advertise (except at comp.sys.be.announce, if you follow
their rules), but there is a lot to gain from being active on these
newsgroups. You can help people with their questions and also get
information from a wide variety of sources. Newsgroups are read by a lot
of people, even if they are not actively posting, so being active helps
you and your products become known.

Greetings! As it turns out, I am back in the hot seat again much sooner
than anticipated. With Doug on vacation and my wedding swiftly
approaching, we belatedly discovered a need to rearrange the order of the
DTS Newsletter writing. So, you get me again now, and then will be
hippo-free until late June or early July.
</p><p>
Along with rearranging Newsletter duties, the DTS team also sat down to
more clearly parcel out responsibilities for sections of the BeOS. These
"areas of expertise" loosely define where we should be focussing our
individual efforts for investigating bugs, answering developer questions,
writing sample code and so on. I was lucky enough to inherit many of the
lower-level Kits, including: the Kernel, Mail, Network, Storage, and
Support Kits, rounded off with developer tools and add-ons.
</p><p>
This week I am going to talk about some of the things that we forget to
talk about every now and then. I'll start with two "forgotten functions"
from my areas: <code class="function">cast_as()</code> and <code class="function">snooze_until()</code>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id688960"></a>cast_as()</h3></div></div></div><p>
Take a look sometime inside of
<code class="filename">support/ClassInfo.h</code>. You will see some
useful macros there that probably do not see the light of day as much as
they should, at least if outside engineers are anything like we are. The
<code class="function">cast_as()</code> macro is the most important of these functions (although the
others can certainly be useful.)
</p><p>
There are some places in the BeOS where <span class="type">void *</span>s are thrown about with
great abandon. Those that leap readily to mind include dealing with items
from BLists and arguments for thread entry functions. It is very tempting
to simply use C-style casts to deal with these pointers, but this is not
smart. (And before we go farther I will admit to being dumb in all of my
sample code until now, look for updates in the near future to correct
this.) Let me give you a concrete example of how this could be
problematic.
</p><p>
Assume that you have a <code class="classname">BList</code> that is
(supposedly) full of <code class="classname">BRect</code> pointers.
You want to look at these pointers and find one that contains a given
<code class="classname">BPoint</code>. You would have a loop whose inner core looked like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BRect</code> *</span>rect = (<span class="type"><code class="classname">BRect</code> *</span>) <code class="varname">list</code>.<code class="methodname">ItemAt</code>(<code class="varname">index</code>);
if (<code class="varname">rect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Contains</code>(<code class="varname">point</code>)) {
  <span class="comment">/* do something cool */</span>
}
</pre><p>
This is all fine and dandy if the item at index is actually a <code class="classname">BRect</code>. The
result if the item is not a <code class="classname">BRect</code> is undefined (and probably most
undesirable).
</p><p>
But there is a way to make sure that this slice of evil never occurs.
Change the inner loop to something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void *</span><code class="varname">item</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>;
<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">rect</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>;

<code class="varname">item</code> = <code class="varname">list</code>.<code class="methodname">ItemAt</code>(<code class="varname">index</code>);
<code class="varname">rect</code> = cast_as(<code class="varname">item</code>, <code class="classname">BRect</code>);
if (!<code class="varname">rect</code>) {
  <code class="function">printf</code>("we don't have a rect here!\n");
  return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
}
<span class="comment">/* we are safe and know that rect is indeed a BRect*/</span>
if (<code class="varname">rect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Contains</code>(<code class="varname">point</code>)) {
  <span class="comment">/* do something cool */</span>
}
</pre><p>
Now, in an ideal world you wouldn't end up with a situation where you
have chosen the wrong <code class="classname">BList</code> to look through, or where you haven't
accidentally added the wrong pointer to the right <code class="classname">BList</code>. But these things
have been known to happen!
</p><p>
Another, and perhaps more common, use for the <code class="function">cast_as()</code> macro is found
when playing in the Interface Kit. There are many functions that simply
return a generic <span class="type"><code class="classname">BView</code>*</span>. Whenever these need to be cast to a more
specific class using the <code class="function">cast_as()</code> macro will prove much safer than a
blind C-style cast.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id689208"></a>snooze_until()</h3></div></div></div><p>
A new thread control function was added to the Kernel Kit in Release 3
that deserves mention. <code class="function">snooze_until()</code> allows a thread to block until a
certain time is reached. This is exciting, of course, but how does
<code class="function">snooze_until()</code> differ from it's older sibling
<code class="function">snooze()</code>?
</p><p>
The most obvious way is that <code class="function">snooze_until()</code> supports defining a time to
awaken based on a named time base. In Release 3 the only time base
supported is the <code class="constant">B_SYSTEM_TIMEBASE</code>, which simply deals with the system
time. In the future we will support other time bases so <code class="function">snooze_until()</code>
could be used to block until a given frame of video is ready or until the
next MIDI event needs to be sent.
</p><p>
The other major difference (and the only one of real use now) is that
<code class="function">snooze_until()</code> has been designed to be more
accurate than <code class="function">snooze()</code>. This
accuracy comes in large part from the possibilities of being rescheduled
between calls. Take the following example where you want to snooze for 25
milliseconds in between some <code class="function"><code class="function">printf</code>()</code> calls.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="function">printf</code>("let's print!\n");
<code class="function">snooze</code>(25000);
<code class="function">printf</code>("let's print again!\n");
</pre><p>
In the best of all worlds there would only be the 25 millisecond interval
between the calls. But in the worst case your thread could be rescheduled
right after the first <code class="function"><code class="function">printf</code>()</code>, and when next rescheduled would
immediately block for the 25 milliseconds, and then would be rescheduled
after the <code class="function">snooze()</code>. With a thread rescheduling latency of 1 -2
milliseconds, this could mean that you could sleep for a handful of
milliseconds extra.
</p><p>
You could rewrite this code using <code class="function">snooze_until()</code> and your worst case
scenario would look a little better.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="varname">now</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
<code class="function">printf</code>("let's print!\n");
<code class="function">snooze_until</code>(<code class="varname">now</code> + 25000);
<code class="function">printf</code>("let's print again!\n");
</pre><p>
This will base the wake-up time on the original "now" time, rather than
the time that the <code class="function">snooze()</code> function was called, and should be better.
</p><p>
There are currently some caveats, however. The difference in performance
between <code class="function">snooze_until()</code> and <code class="function">snooze()</code>
is generally not noticeable unless
running within a real-time thread or if the amount of time to snooze is
very small. In general, it doesn't make any sense to try and snooze for
less than 1 millisecond, because interrupts are only looked at every
millisecond. However, when <code class="function">snooze_until()</code> is called and the amount of
time left until the wake-up time is very small, it will return rather
than have the thread rescheduled. This makes tight timing loops more
accurate (assuming you have a need for such a tight loop anyway).
</p><p>
And as mentioned, this really only makes a huge difference when dealing
with a real-time thread. If you are not dealing with a real-time thread
there is no guarantee that you will run when you are ready. If higher
priority threads are ready to run, they will go first, regardless of
which type of nap you took. Even when dealing with a real-time thread,
you must still be aware that there are latencies involved, on the order
of 2-3 milliseconds max, and 1 millisecond on average, so timing loops
will never be precisely accurate.

One last forgotten item. In the mad rush to get Release 3 out the door,
we forgot to also release the GNU Public License code that used in the
BeOS. We are rectifying this lapse in memory now.
</p><p>
We use GPL code for malloc, termcap and crypt. This are directly linked
into the kernel, libroot, telnet, telnetd, top, and zbeos (the BeOS Intel
bootloader). We have a single downloadable archive called gnu_x86.tar.gz
that contains makefiles, the GNU source code, and object files that allow
you to rebuild these components.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/gnu/gnu_x86.tar.gz
</p><p>
We also use GPL code for our 3Com 3C905 Ethernet drivers. This code comes
from Linux and the source is available in an archive called
linux_ether.tar.gz.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/gnu/linux_ether.tar.gz
</p><p>
The other GNU tools used by the BeOS are included in the /optional
directory of the Release 3 CD.
</p><p>
The packages are complete and allow you to rebuild the GNU code and
relink to produce the final binaries. Unfortunately if you make
modifications (or used modified versions) we can't offer support if you
run into problems.
</p><p>
We thank you all for your patience and friendly reminders to make these
packages available. Be is a strong supporter of "free" software, and we
will continue to do our best to comply with the license requirements of
the code included in the BeOS.

In late March this year, we held our first developer conference that
focused on the Intel platform. Now we are preparing for our first trade
show with a similar focus, but a much bigger audience. This is PC Expo,
in New York City, opening June 16th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
</p><p>
As we learned from inflicting our inexperience on BeOS enthusiasts who
ordered the Release 3 for Intel product, we are likely to find that
nothing we've done so far can fully prepare us for an event like PC Expo.
We've been to MacWorld trade shows, a couple of Comdexes—the first in
the PowerPC pavilion, the second generously hosted by our Umax friends --
we've been to NAB, with the Adamation booth this time, but never as
"ourselves" to a PC Expo.
</p><p>
I'm sure we'll undergo more humbling and comical experiences which will
be reported here—at least the admissible ones. Still, since we
released the Intel version of our BeOS, we've learned a few lessons we
plan to bring with us to our "coming out" at PC Expo.
</p><p>
First, we've verified there is demand for our product. I'm not trying to
be funny or attempting to brag. Consider this: We mostly gave away the
PowerPC version of the BeOS, on CDs bundled with magazines and as a free
download version. This was a good way to spread the news and to bootstrap
an installed base for Be developers. However, we learned we weren't
learning much from this distribution method.
</p><p>
As some companies have found, the free software habit is hard to kick.
Shareholders get nervous and the intended audiences—developers and
customers—experience mixed emotions. It feels good at first, but will
it last? And, in any event, giving away your product makes it hard to get
a feel for the demand out there.
</p><p>
For those reasons, there is no free BeOS for Intel. So far, customers
have been kind, putting up with our fledgling e-commerce system,
overtaxed voice mail, and learn-as-you-go bumbling. Returns are very few
and, while demand has settled down from its early peak, we enjoy a modest
daily current of business from the US, Europe, and Japan. No strutting in
the end zone, but we are a little ahead of our (conservative) goals for
this year.
</p><p>
Second, we have to re-emphasize the "geeks-only" status of our product.
We're not ready for the mainstream. Installation isn't for normal people,
there are still too few applications (though this is changing), and we
support only a limited range of hardware devices. This also is changing,
but we will never cover the immense range of configurations Windows does.
</p><p>
To help people through the labyrinth of hardware compatibility, we hope
to offer a Windows application for download soon. Once in your system, it
would test your hardware and return one of three answers: yes; not sure,
please allow us to upload the test results to galactic headquarters; or,
no, sorry, we're not worthy of your hardware.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, we're not sitting still. We plan to offer a very minimalist
VGA grey scale driver for Release 3.1. If the BeOS CD does not contain a
driver for your graphics card, this driver will still let you boot on
(almost) any display adapter, install the BeOS, and look for the right
driver on our Web site or other related ones. In addition, as we are
doing with our friends at UMI and the "Ming Specials" listed on our Web
site, we'll work with system vendors to identify "BeOS Ready" systems.
</p><p>
Third, I just mentioned Release 3.1. It is exactly what the numbering
convention implies: rolling up bug fixes, adding more drivers (including
the basic VGA install capability mentioned above). PC Expo gives us a
good deadline to beat for that release. I tend to like "dot" releases.
They solidify the previous "major" version, they fix more bugs than they
create—unlike the "big" releases—and they instill confidence in
developers and customers.
</p><p>
Fourth, since we introduced the BeOS for Intel Architecture PCs, we've
learned we have to keep working hard at differentiating our work from
IBM's futile attempt to position OS/2 as "Better DOS than DOS, better
Windows than Windows." Once the audience realizes we mean it when we
acknowledge Windows as the immensely successful general-purpose reference
OS, it becomes much easier to position the BeOS as a complementary
specialized OS for video and audio applications.
</p><p>
The stealth success of Linux as a specialized OS, a Unix clone coexisting
peacefully with Windows, helps demonstrate the validity of the general
purpose vs. specialized concept. We also find that our non-religious,
non-Microsoft-bashing posture is appreciated. Others do the bashing very
well; we'd like to stay focused on all the things we have to do for
customers and developers.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, and this is the last item on my list for today, PC
Expo will give all of us an opportunity to show applications, sell some
product, display work in progress, show promising prototypes, and, in
general, demonstrate momentum on the application side.
</p><p>
For us on the release side, a trade show is effective persuasion for
getting developers to bring their work to the next stage, especially when
moving PowerPC code to the Intel side. We'll have demo stations set up,
so if you'd like to show your work, please let us know. With the "geeks
only" positioning clearly established, we'll enjoy the right subset of PC
Expo visitors.

Can the Be filesystem become fragmented? Is there any way to check for
fragmentation, or to defragment?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Yes, fragmentation is possible, but, according to Dominic Giampaolo...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">In practice BFS seems quite resilient against fragmentation. I recently
ran some diagnostics on some systems around here that have been in
constant use for 6 months or more... Over 98% of the files on all three
machines were stored in one or two contiguous runs of disk blocks.</span>”
</p><p>
Tyler Riti wonders whether defragmenting is worth it: 30 minutes of
defragging to gain a few milliseconds of seek time. Furthermore, does
defragmenting actually buy you back those milliseconds? Of course it
does, says the conventional wisdom; but multi-threading confounds the
issue. If two or more programs are hitting different files at the same
time, then the contiguity of the files isn't necessarily a help, and can
actually be a hindrance (since the order in which the blocks are hit
isn't necessarily sorted).

The BeIDE puts object files in a directory that's always named
"(Objects)". If you zip and move your project directory between PPC and
Intel, you clobber the destination object files. Can anybody think of an
automated way to avoid this?
</p><p>
Thorbjorn Jemander (and others) suggested creating a directory structure
that separates the projects from the source:
</p><pre class="screen">
/proj/x86/
/proj/PPC/
/proj/source/
</pre><p>
The project and "(Objects)" directory live in the respective architecture
directories, and the source code lives in the "source" directory. The
projects would include the common sources, but wouldn't step on each
other's object files.
</p><p>
Most folks liked the solution, although it isn't perfect: If you change
the set of source files, you have to update both projects (for example).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id689732"></a>Subject: html indexing tool?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Scripting talk with all the usual snakes and ladders: Python, Perl,
Frontier, etc.
</p><p>
The usefulness of Be API-specific components (BMessage, BPath, etc.) as
scripting candidates was clarified. Some of our readers debated whether
an object database (as used by some scripting environments) is necessary:
Is the BFS fast enough to use directories as tables and files as records?
</p><p>
Other topics: How should data types (int16, int32, et. al.) be
represented within a script message? Is string representation too slow?
W.G.J. Langeveld thinks strings are plenty fast enough, given the context:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Well sure, strings aren't all that speedy. They're not horrible either,
compared to the time to interpret the instruction (which is a string
anyway) and the task switch time to send the message. How many numbers
will a typical message contain? If you think the answer is more than 10,
then I think we have different ideas of what scripting is supposed to
accomplish.</span>”
</p><p>
How should different data types be presented to the user? Need the user
know the difference between int32 and int64 (for example)? Chris Herborth
suggested that the scripting interface follow the API. Some readers
objected on the grounds that this would be too complex for users. Mr.
Herborth responded:
</p><p>
“I'm going to exactly mirror the API, then start working on making a
simplified API for people doing common tasks. By having everything there
at the start, I'm enabling anyone to come up with:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
a correct application scripting message :-)
</p></li><li><p>
the ability to make a simplified API”
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The attitude of "smarter doesn't mean harder" didn't appease all of our
readers. It was generally agreed that a scripting language's first
requirement is that it be easy to use; it mustn't require knowledge of
implementation details such as BMessage format or data byte-length. Some
folks are concerned that a "robust" language will cut corners when it
comes to hiding details.
</p><p>
A grass-roots, module-by-module, Frontier-like project was proposed by
Jake "Jake Hamby" Hamby.

Peter Enzerink wants to know why the <span class="type">float</span>ing point benchmarks run slower
in BeOS Release 3 than on Windows 95. There were no direct answers, but a
number of subthreads:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
How much does compiler optimization affect performance? No clear
answer, but most of our listeners seem to think that you shouldn't
expect more than a 10% speed up.
</p></li><li><p>
Does a higher thread priority mean a faster app? No—you should
never try to improve overall app speed by increasing thread priorities.
If you have a real-time stream, then use a real-time priority; but
goosing all threads in an effort to (A) get more performance out of the
system or (B) play beat-your-neighbor is (A) ill-conceived and futile,
and (B) exhibits a pathetic insecurity and mean spirit.
</p></li><li><p>
Can you really use MSVC to compile BeOS code (as a listener implied)?
It's been done; Jon Watte suggests...
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Write speed-critical section in C only.
</p></li><li><p>
Transfer needed header files to Windows NT
</p></li><li><p>
Compile C files with MSVC
</p></li><li><p>
Transfer .OBJ files to BeOS, renaming them .o
</p></li><li><p>
Compile C++ files with mwcc
</p></li><li><p>
Link it all together to an app
</p></li></ol></div></li></ul><p>
Note that this is an unsupported phenomenon.

Are "gestural" input systems useful? Listener Chaut liked the sound of
the Windows app that lets you...
</p><p>
"...draw a 'W' (at the scale you want) with your mouse and it launches
Word ..."
</p><p>
Would this be just a weekend hack, or is this an example of (notoriously
difficult) OCR in sheep's clothing? (Yes it is, no it isn't, went the
debate.)
</p><p>
A number of listeners wrote in to second the call for more BeOS input
devices (stylus pads and the like), but some of us just couldn't take the
</p><p>
Subject seriously and will be spending the evening in our rooms. Mike
Manzano:

Is there a difference between the PPC and Intel versions of BFS that
would prevent a user from reading the PPC CD on a PC running BeOS?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: (From Dominic Giampaolo) We do not currently support reading
PPC versions of BFS under Intel (nor the other way around). The layout of
the file system is the same on both platforms, only the endianess is
different.
</p><p>
Support for reading opposite-endian file systems is planned for a future
release although I'm not sure when it will make it in.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id690124"></a>Subject: mimetypes questions</h4></div></div></div><p>
In a subthread of the mimetypes topic, flavors of zip were discussed:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
gzip: Good compression, particularly on multiple small files (since
it compresses the lot of them as a single stream), but it doesn't
preserve Be attributes. Also, since gzip produces a stream, damage is
difficult to correct.
</p></li><li><p>
zip: zip archives files individually so its compression isn't as good
as gzip (although the difference isn't overwhelming), but damage repair
is easier. Also, zip preserves Be attributes; this feature tilts the
scales in many cases.
</p></li><li><p>
bzip2: Best compression, although, again, there's not a huge
difference. If you absolutely have to squish out that last 10% of
trapped air, then use bzip2; otherwise, don't worry about it. And bzip2
(according to Trey Boudreau) isn't protected by patent lawyers (as bzip
is).
