going on. In last week's Engineering Insights column, Dominic Giampaolo
described how Be files are organized and represented in the new system
and how database features are merged into this representation. In other
words, last week we saw the "file" part of the file system; this week,
I'm going to show you the "system."
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id509646"></a>Loadable File Systems: The File System Protocol</h3></div></div></div><p>If we zoom out a bit, we'll see that the Be file system proper is
actually just one implementation of the more general Be file system
protocol (FSP).
</p><p>The file system protocol is an API for a set of common file operations
(open, read, write, and so on). To support a particular "brand" of file
system, one simply implements the FSP API to do whatever the file system
expects to be done.
</p><p>In addition to our native file system, we've implemented (or are
implementing) this protocol for DOS, HFS, NFS, and ISO9660. When you (the
developer or user) want to talk to a file that resides on a DOS volume,
the kernel simply loads the DOS FSP add-on, just as it would load an
add-on to talk to a specific graphics card or other device. In fact,
implementing an FSP is mostly an exercise in writing a kernel add-on: The
type of work that's required is comparable to writing a new device
driver. It's not for the hobbyist, but it's not terribly difficult
(unless, of course, you care about efficiency, reliability, and
integrity).
</p><p>The communication between the kernel and a file system (that is, an FSP
add-on) is "message-based." When a program makes a file system call, such
as open(), read(), or mkdir(), the kernel maps the call to a specific FSP
message and then "sends" the message to the file system. The part of the
kernel that provides this mapping is called the file system independent
layer (FSIL).
</p><p>Currently, FSP messages are simply function calls; thus, for example,
when your program calls open(), the FSIL maps the call to (and invokes)
an FSP function called op_open(). This function-call-as-message interface
works well with add-ons - - but we also want to extend the interface to
make it more flexible. For example, we plan to allow user-level programs
to act as file systems. Communication, in this case, could be through a
pipe or port.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id509692"></a>Design Goals</h3></div></div></div><p>While designing the file system protocol and the file system independent
layer, we had three goals:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Parallelism. We wanted a given file system to be able to handle more
than one FSP message at a time—it should be able to delete file A
while writing to file B. To aid in this, we needed to design the FSIL
such that it did as little serialization (of FSP messages) as possible.
</p><p>Of course, some operations need to be serialized in order to maintain
structural consistency and re-entrancy; but only the file system
implementation (at the FSP level) should know which calls need to be
serialized. The FSIL shouldn't make any assumptions. For example,
imagine what would happen if the FSIL assumed that reading and closing
a file were mutually exclusive operations that needed to be serialized:
In other words, if you tried to close a file that you were reading, the
FSIL would hold the close() message until the read() completed. This is
fine for normal files—but it doesn't work for a UNIX-style pipe in
which read() is often blocked waiting for more data to show up. If the
FSIL withheld the close() call while the read() call was blocked, your
application (and, possibly, the entire file system) would deadlock.
</p></li><li><p>Re-entrancy. The FSIL must be thread-safe. Thread safety applies most
notably to the identification of "nodes" (files or directories). How
does the FSIL tell a file system which node an operation is meant to
apply to? Names can't be used since there's no guarantee that the name
will stay the same: For example, some other thread might rename the
file we're currently reading—and we don't want our read to fail
simply because the open file has been renamed! We could serialize all
the calls to a particular node, but that violates our goal of maximum
parallelism.
</p><p>Instead, the FSIL maintains a "node structure" that's independent of
the node name. This structure is passed with every file system
operation. When can the FSIL free a node structure? It isn't safe to do
it after deleting a node because some other thread may still hold the
node open.
</p><p>The solution we came up with is to provide a reference count on the
nodes. Every time a node is opened (or passed as a parameter to an FSP
function), its reference count is incremented. Then, when the node is
closed (or after the FSP function returns), the reference count is
decremented. The node is freed only when the reference count reaches 0.
</p></li><li><p>Thorough Generality. We wanted the FSP to be general enough to handle
a broad variety of file systems: DOS, HFS, NFS, ISO9660, and others.
And in addition to these "real" file systems, we also wanted to be able
to implement "virtual" file systems. Instead of representing real files
stored somewhere on a disk, virtual file systems provide "services."
For example, the /dev file system provides access to hardware devices;
the /pipe file system gives access to UNIX-like pipes. Virtual file
systems are potentially the most interesting part of the new system.

Let's look at some of the FSP protocol:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_open</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>, <span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">omode</code>,
<span class="type">void **</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>);

typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_close</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>);

typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_free_cookie</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>,
<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>);

typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_read</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>,
<span class="type">off_t</span> <code class="parameter">pos</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">buf</code>, <span class="type">size_t *</span><code class="parameter">len</code>);

typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_write</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>,
<span class="type">off_t</span> <code class="parameter">pos</code>, <span class="type">constvoid *</span><code class="parameter">buf</code>, <span class="type">size_t *</span><code class="parameter">len</code>);

typedef <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">op_ioctl</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ns</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">node</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>,
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">cmd</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">buf</code>, <span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="parameter">len</code>);
</pre><p>In these prototypes, <code class="parameter">ns</code> designates the "name space," or volume, that the
node is on; this is necessary since a single FSP implementation (that is,
for a particular file system) can serve more than one volume. The <code class="parameter">cookie</code>
argument is what allows the file system to distinguish between different
clients of the same file. Every time <code class="function">open()</code> is called, the file system
has the opportunity to allocate a cookie. The FSIL passes the cookie as
an argument to the FSP calls with every subsequent operation on this open
file.
</p><p>By looking at the operation names, the mapping between system calls and
file system operations is quite obvious. For example, the system call
<code class="function">open()</code> is turned into the <code class="function">op_open()</code>
FSP function. <code class="function">op_free_cookie()</code> is the
only operation that's not self-explanatory: It frees the cookie allocated
by <code class="function">op_open()</code>. Why do we need a separate function for this? You might
think that we could free the cookie in <code class="function">op_close()</code>—but that would
actually be wrong. If <code class="function">op_close()</code> freed the cookie, there would be a race
condition with ongoing <code class="function">op_read()</code> and <code class="function">op_write()</code> calls operating on the
same cookie. The solution, once again, is to reference count the cookie.
A separate operation <code class="function">op_free_cookie()</code> is invoked after <code class="function">op_close()</code> when
the last operation on the cookie returns.
</p><p>I hope you've gotten an idea of the kinds of issues we dealt with while
designing the FSIL and the FSP. The FSP API probably won't be released
until after DR9, but no doubt the subject will show up in the news groups
before then. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at
cyril@be.com.

Other than the fact that it ushers in the
heaviest shopping day of the year, I can't forget that I am grateful for
many things.
</p><p>My 19-month-old likes keyboards and mice.<br />
My wife is a programmer.<br />
I have plenty of computers.<br />
I'm allowed to program as much as I want.<br />
And my favorite computer now has a MIDI synthesizer in software!
</p><p>In case you missed that, Marc Ferguson, who spelled out the whats and
whyfors of MIDI in a previous newsletter, has released the software
synthesizer for DR8.2. There are two packages you can install. One is
relatively small and will get you hearing as soon as possible. The other
is quite large and you can download it at a more leisurely pace.
</p><p>ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr8_update/simple_midi_small.tgz
</p><p>In this package you will find two things:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>simple-midi</td><td>The actual player</td></tr><tr><td>general.midi.small</td><td>A smaller version of the instruments (315 K)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Place the general.midi.small file into /boot/system/bin.data and rename
it general.midi. Put the simple-midi file anywhere you like, possibly
/boot/apps. You should do a setfile simple-midi once it's installed.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can get the bigger package, which contains the
higher-quality instruments.
</p><p>ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr8_update/simple_midi_large.tgz
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>simple-midi</td><td>The actual player</td></tr><tr><td>general.midi</td><td>The full bodied instruments (5 MB)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Again, place the general.midi file into /boot/system/bin.data and put the
simple-midi file anywhere you like.
</p><p>This is a drag-and-drop interface for playing MIDI files. Simply drag a
MIDI file onto the icon and it starts playing. You can also play files by
starting the application and using the Open button. You should only
execute a single MIDI player at a time. If you try tricks like copying
the file and playing multiple files that way, you might not get what you
expect.
</p><p>Personally, I'm not a MIDI person. I don't do instruments, but I can
certainly appreciate high-quality music (for a computer) when I hear it.
I played with quite a few MIDI sequences and they sound great. And since
the instruments will be the same on all machines that install this
package, the music will sound relatively similar on yours, too.
</p><p>This is not the final effort for software MIDI on the BeOS. This is
merely a placeholder for what will come in DR9. The synthesizer doesn't
provide you with an API so that you can use it from within your own
application; this will show up in DR9. But for those who've been dying to
hear some thumpin' sounds out of their machines without having to buy a
hardware synthesizer, your day has come.

programmers to get serious things done using the BeOS. One thing I've
learned in recent years is that no matter how good you are, the Internet
will bring someone to your door who is much better. I believe the BeOS
has attracted extremely skilled, highly motivated programmers who crank
out the most awesome stuff, and honestly, I find myself learning from
them as often as I humbly try to teach them.
</p><p>If you don't check the <span class="trademark">BeWare</span>™ and ftp.be.com site often, you should.
There are new offerings coming out all the time. I've mentioned a number
of developer offerings in the past, and I'll continue to try and
highlight things as they come by.
</p><p>Of particular note this week are two applications that have been
progressing over the past few months. You can check the What's New page
at ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/whatsnew.txt to see where they are.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>BetMap. This is a drag-and-drop paint program, the likes of which
you've probably never seen. I said the same thing when it first came
out, and it's still true. Only now it has an API so you can participate
in this add-ons-gone-wild world.
</p></li><li><p>Zonic. This is a very useful and very clean layout engine and widget
set. I think it demonstrates the ease with which multiple interfaces
can be created for the BeOS without too much work. You should get the
demo and play with it. "Really neat" is probably the best description.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id510329"></a>Apologies And Cheerleading</h3></div></div></div><p>As many people have pointed out to me via e-mail, "Why aren't the samples
available when the newsletter comes out?" No one to blame but me.
Excuses... Excuses... Excuses... The standard refrains apply, and I'll
try to do better in the future. There's only me doing these things, and
things do get busy, but there is hope. One of the busy things I've been
doing is interviewing many candidates to jump into the pit with me. It
goes well, and you should have some new targets... I mean new voices of
support soon.
</p><p>Remember Macworld? It's now one week closer than the last time I
mentioned it. Thump, thump, thump. Hear that? That's the beat of the Be
Drum. It's pushing you to develop that code as fast as you can so that we
can show your wares and what promises to be an illuminating, highly
visible event for the BeOS and its developers.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing1-52"></a>Be Marketing Mutterings: Comdex, Sore Feet But No Sore Heads</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Alex</span> <span class="surname">Osadzinski</span></span></div></div></div><p>I'm not a great fan of Comdex, so much so that I've avoided attending or
exhibiting there for six years. But when Motorola graciously offered us
two demo stations in their PowerPC Pavilion at Comdex this year, the
tightwad in me couldn't resist. Accordingly, Maureen Miller, our trade
show manager, Ron Theis, our Webmaster, and I spent five days showing the
BeOS on a <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ and on a Power Computing machine to thousands and
thousands of people.
</p><p>It was actually fun.
</p><p>This is quite amazing.
</p><p>Most people work for two kinds of income: Actual money and psychic
income. Psychic income is the satisfaction you get from doing your job.
Comdex was fun because no matter how many times we gave the BeOS demo, we
got tremendous psychic income from the reactions of the audience. It was
also fun because Las Vegas appears to have outgrown the show. It was
possible to get a cab without waiting for two hours. It was possible to
get a table at a restaurant. And it was possible to get a hotel room,
albeit for a price that made one's eyeballs bleed.
</p><p>We survived the show by working hard and by avoiding the traditional
trade show excesses of late-night parties and lots of drinking. Our feet
hurt, but not our heads. I will confess that all three of us succumbed to
the allure of the craps table but, incredibly, all won Big Money (well,
OK, Some Money). This bodes well and probably means that there's good
karma surrounding Be employees these days. The casino system seems to
function on the basis that, while we cheered and rejoiced at winning $15
(our threshold of excitement was fairly low), portly gentlemen in plaid
pants smoking noxious cigars were losing $100 at a time.
</p><p>The most pleasant and gratifying part of the show was that over half the
people coming to our booth knew our company's name, knew roughly what
we're trying to achieve, and wanted to see a demo. This is a huge change
from, say, May of this year, when most visitors to a trade show booth had
never heard of us. The rampant speculation in the press about our future
seems to have had one benefit, at least. It was also nice to meet with
many Be developers and put faces to e-mail addresses. Nicer still, many
of the developers are working on real projects, having moved on from
simply experimenting with the BeOS.
</p><p>Were there any other interesting things at Comdex? I don't know! Our
booth was never quiet enough to allow us to slip away to check out the
rest of the show.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-52"></a>CoffeeBean</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>I just flew back from Maui by way of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Using this
itinerary to raise questions about my sanity is fruitless—I'm engaged
in work on an alternative personal computer platform to begin with. But,
seriously, I had a good reason. After taking my family of French pilgrims
to celebrate the ultimate American holiday in a locale more fitting our
(vastly exaggerated) hedonistic roots, I flew to Carnegie Mellon for the
reading of Paul Clip's thesis, CoffeeBean, a Java virtual machine
implemented on the BeOS under the tutelage of Professor Adam Beguelin.
</p><p>It was good and useful fun. Developing applications for a platform still
in its infancy isn't for everyone. Writing system-level code is living
even more dangerously, especially at a time when the system is still
changing at a fast pace from one revision to another. So, Paul Clip's
project wasn't only a test of his intellect and manhood, but also a way
to push our product in areas that aren't necessarily probed in other
developments. Overall, Paul was generous in his comments, so much so I
won't repeat the most enthusiastic ones. His work pointed out to several
weaknesses (in California, "areas for improvement"). Some have to do with
differences with Sun's views of the world. For instance, Java expects
64-bit signed integers, which are unavailable in the current version of
the C++ compiler on our system. There's also a difference between the
systems used by the two worlds for priorities and synchronization. An
opportunity for us to roadtest our kernel in subtle scheduling
situations. Paul's work also fingered a problem other Be developers have
discovered, this one related to hardware. Not all multithreading
situations are dealt with equally well by our system. When we moved from
the AT&amp;T Hobbit processor to the PowerPC, the 604 was unavailable and
projected to be prohibitively expensive (for us at least). The 601 was
clearly an ephemeral product. Only the 603 had the future and the price
we liked. There was one glitch, however: Motorola stated that
multiprocessor systems couldn't be implemented with the 603. On closer
examination, this techno-marketing statement was based on the absence of
cache-coherency hardware on the 603. Loosely speaking, cache coherency is
a function by which one processor can advise others of the "pollution" of
data contained in its cache, thus preventing its colleagues from reliance
on now-invalid copies of the same data in their own caches. We decided we
could work around that problem, mostly in software, and we produced
working 603-based dual-processor hardware. In most cases, the workaround
we designed imposes an invisible performance penalty. Now, imagine a
situation where two threads, one to each processor, work on the same
data. This can give rise to sizable overhead when the caches have to be
constantly updated. One can construct cases when two processors perform
more slowly than when one BeBox CPU is turned off. Fortunately, in real
life, the system performs loosely coupled tasks most of the time, and the
603 penalty isn't a factor. The 604 is now available, without much of the
earlier price penalty exacted on our small company with its limited
purchase power; it features cache-coherency hardware and thus does away
with the limitations of the 603 in MP applications. If not all, most
PowerMac licensees have 604 dual-processor hardware but not much system
software to take advantage of it, a situation we intend to deal with
promptly.
</p><p>Back to Carnegie-Mellon, we're grateful for Prof. Beguelin's hospitality,
we thank Paul Clip for his dissecting dissertation of our system, and
we've already incorporated several of his suggestions into the next
release of our system.

benaphores) and thread calls. Various scenarios were hypothesized; some
were answered with source code examples.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id510517"></a>Subject: [CALL FOR VOTE ?!] Active window != Frontmost window</h4></div></div></div><p>This discussion, which was initially about different ways to let the
user place/tile/layer windows on the desktop, veered into a debate on
the meaning and enforcement of "multi- user," as well as a search for
the perfect real-world analogy for user-settable GUI preferences.
</p><p>Combining the two thoughts, we have your boss's wife peeking over your
shoulder as she tries to hijack your car. No one pointed out the
blatant sexism in "the boss's wife," but the thread is young.

No clear
consensus, but a number of folks pointed out that you have to keep the
concept of VM separate from that of swapping—it's possible to have
"good" VM but "bad" swapping. In particular, an unbounded swap file is
bad.

—was answered, and then the thread went on to discuss whether
programatically shutting down or powering off is a desirable feature,
and, if allowed, how it should be coordinated with a UPS. In general,
soft-off is seen as a nice feature that can easily be abused; it was
proposed that the mechanism be protected by root authentication (once
multi-user is implemented).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id510587"></a>Subject: Two comments on AppSketcher</h4></div></div></div><p>Some initial remarks about Marc Verstaen's AppSketcher led to a wider
discussion of UI modeling engines (M. Verstaen pointed out that
AppSketcher isn't intended to be such an engine). Should the UI for an
app be hand-tweaked, and the coordinates hard-coded, or is this in
itself an indication of poor design? It was offered that a good layout
engine can figure out where things should go based on relative sizes
and positions without the programmer having to supply any coordinate
values. Others balk at the thought of automated UI design. It ended in
tears.

AKA: Newsletter #51 - File Details<br />
AKA: Regarding journaling and DR9 FS.
</h5></div></div></div><p>This thread collected comments on Dominic Giampaolo's article in last
week's newsletter. Some folks are disappointed in the decision to
retain a hierarchical file system, but there was approbation (and
expectation) for the IFS aspects of the system. (See Cyril Meurillon's
article in this issue for more information.) The final thread (of the
above) offered suggestions for fine-tuning the journaling feature.

proposed. The thread became quite precise in its detail: The exact
format of version numbers and the structure that would store version
information were discussed. The one debatable subject was whether
version strings should be human-readable.

A number of listeners
(well, a couple, anyway) were interested in emulating this behavior.
There were some guesses about what was happening, and then Peter
Potrebic parted the curtains:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>User starts dragging a selection in ImageViewer. It doesn't
know the destination so it uses it's own data format for the image.
</p></li><li><p>The image is dropped on the Browser. The Browser doesn't
understand the message so it replies with a <code class="constant">B_MESSAGE_NOT_UNDERSTOOD</code>.
</p></li><li><p>ImageViewer receives the <code class="constant">B_MESSAGE_NOT_UNDERSTOOD</code> ... [creates]
a temp file and replies back to the sender.
</p></li><li><p>The Browser gets this reply. It knows what to do with files
(refs) so it copies the data file to the appropriate place.
</p></li></ol></div><p>You can find example code in the RRRRRRRRaster app:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/Rras_sdk.tgz
</p><p>A proposal for generalizing the drag-to-save mechanism was proposed and
debated.

general, and creating localized calendars specifically. It was conceded
that the Chinese calendar is notoriously difficult.
