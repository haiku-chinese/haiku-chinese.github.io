Since the performance of applications is pretty important on the BeBox,
here are some hints that can save you time both during execution and when
writing code.
</p><p>
The first thing you can do to slow the machine to a crawl is to use the
View system. The application server keeps the exact clipping region for
every view in a window up to date. When the number of views gets large,
the clipping region for the view hierarchies can become very complex to
maintain! Furthermore, when part of a window needs to be redrawn, the
protocol between the server and the client for view redraw is
synchronous, meaning that there is a substantial fixed overhead for view
redrawing.
</p><p>
Need I say more? Many views cause poor performance; fewer views
containing simple user views are often faster and aren't much harder to
implement. The Browser offers a good example, using its own simple view
system to represent icons.
</p><p>
Most of the communication between a client window and the application
server is done using buffered messages. This means that multiple graphic
requests are queued in a buffer before being sent to the app_server. This
dramatically reduces the overhead of a client-server architecture by
reducing the number of context switches. However, there are a number of
calls that can't be buffered due to some synchronization issues or the
need for an immediate result from the server. The best example is
probably
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_StringWidth"><code class="methodname">StringWidth()</code></a>.
If you do some timing using bitmap fonts (such as
Erich and Kate), you'll find that drawing the string is much faster than
measuring it. Be cautious with
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_StringWidth"><code class="methodname">StringWidth()</code></a>.
Consider caching the width of
certain strings locally, or creating your own width table for a given
size of typeface.
</p><p>
Some other calls that use a synchronous protocol include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_ConvertToScreen"><code class="methodname">ConvertToScreen()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_ConvertFromScreen"><code class="methodname">ConvertFromScreen()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_ConvertToParent"><code class="methodname">ConvertToParent()</code></a>
and so on
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_Frame"><code class="methodname">Frame()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_Bounds"><code class="methodname">Bounds()</code></a>
</p></li><li><p>
Many "Get" calls
(<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_GetMouse"><code class="methodname">GetMouse()</code></a>,
<code class="methodname">GetKeys()</code>
and so on)
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_PenSize"><code class="methodname">PenSize()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_StringWidth"><code class="methodname">StringWidth()</code></a>
and other font measuring calls
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_LowColor"><code class="methodname">LowColor()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_HighColor"><code class="methodname">HighColor()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_DrawingMode"><code class="methodname">DrawingMode()</code></a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_CopyBits"><code class="methodname">CopyBits()</code></a>,
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_DrawBitmap"><code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code></a>
(since the bitmap can be modified by another thread!)
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_GetClippingRegion"><code class="methodname">GetClippingRegion()</code></a>
</p></li></ul><p>
A common mistake is to use the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_Bounds"><code class="methodname">Bounds()</code></a>
method of
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
inside a drawing
loop each time you need the bounds of the view. This is a perfect case
for caching, since the bounds won't change while drawing. In fact, most
of the synchronous calls can be cached before using them in a loop, with
the obvious exception of
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_GetMouse"><code class="methodname">GetMouse()</code></a>,
<code class="methodname">GetKeys()</code>, and so on, which are used to
poll changing information.
</p><p>
When redrawing the content of a window, the application server rejects
any view that doesn't intersect the update area. Of course, you're still
responsible for rejecting within your view, since you know exactly what
needs to be drawn. The first stage is to use the rectangle passed to
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_Draw"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>;
the difference can be amazing. The second stage is to ask for the
clipping region, using the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_GetClippingRegion"><code class="methodname">GetClippingRegion()</code></a>
call.</p><p>
The
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_BeginLineArray"><code class="methodname">BeginLineArray()</code></a>...
<code class="methodname">AddLine()</code>...
<code class="methodname">EndLineArray()</code>
system is another good
technique for squeezing more drawing speed out of the system. This
technique is quite a bit faster than the regular
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_MovePenTo"><code class="methodname">MovePenTo()</code></a>...
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.html#BView_StrokeLine"><code class="methodname">StrokeLine()</code></a>...,
often by a factor of 10! When combined with a thick pen size,
<code class="methodname">LineArray()</code>
can be used for some strange purposes, like drawing a color palette.
</p><p>
At this point, Bitmap fonts are an order of magnitude faster than
<span class="trademark">TrueType</span>™ fonts. This will improve in the future, but using bitmap
fonts for common user interface items will make things much smoother!
</p><p>
These are just a few little tips for improving the performance and
efficiency of your applications.

Dan Schwarz, founder of Brookline Software, specializes in utility
software—so far, primarily for the Macintosh. He sees his role as
"finding gaps in the software where Apple didn't supply something useful,
and leaping in to fill that niche." He's hoping to do similar things for
the BeBox.
</p><p>
Not that he expects the Be Operating System to have a lot of gaps. On the
contrary, he says, "I know that the Be folks have learned a lot from
Apple's mistakes. But the system is still very immature, and it seems
like it's ripe for small developers to jump in and do this kind of thing."
</p><p>
Brookline Software has two major Mac products. The first, SerialSpeed
230, addresses the fact that Mac serial ports are faster than most
software can handle. It "brings the software up to speed," Schwarz
explains. The second, the brand-new PrinterSwitch, fills "a longtime gap.
It's very inconvenient on the Mac to switch between printers," Schwarz
says. "The Chooser has been there since 1984, and no one's done anything
with it. Finally, I just got fed up and said, here's a better way to do
this." The products are distributed over the Internet as shareware, a
practice Schwarz expects to continue "for the foreseeable future."
</p><p>
Schwarz was attracted to the BeBox because he feels that, as a small
developer, he has a good chance to establish himself with it. "It's a new
platform, and the big players have not established a foothold as far as
killer applications and utilities go," he says. "I'm not hoping to
compete effectively against Symantec or Microsoft. But in a field where
it's all new, it's a much more level playing field, and there are more
opportunities to be exploited."
</p><p>
He compares the BeBox now to the Macintosh in 1984. "There were a couple
of players who jumped in with software that filled a need and became a de
facto standard," he says, pointing to Aladdin's StuffIt SpaceSaver as an
example. "They were able to come out with a quality product early, and no
one's been able to knock off their lead since then. I'm hoping to
replicate that sort of success."
</p><p>
Schwarz has high hopes for the future of the BeBox—and for Brookline
Software. "Assuming [Be] really hits a market, and really makes an impact
on it, I could see them shipping a lot of units, expanding over a
decade," he says. "And the people that get in first, with products that
make a difference, are going to be the ones that benefit
disproportionately. And that's where I'd like to be."

</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing1-12"></a>Where Will You Purchase Be Products?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Mark</span> <span class="surname">Gonzales</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Here at Be, we've been talking with many (many, many) people and
companies about how best to distribute the Be System—both hardware and
software. There has certainly been no shortage of ideas and suggestions
from other players in the industry. But when we think about this
question, we think more in customer-oriented terms. Where do customers
purchase hardware and software today? Where are they likely to do so in
the future? And what are the most convenient and cost-effective channels,
since customers are constantly on the lookout for better value?
</p><p>
If you think of it from the customer's point of view, the problem becomes
simpler. Customers should be able to learn about and order your products
via any of three methods: Through the Internet, by turning to a local
reseller or VAR, or by picking up the phone.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id475848"></a>The Internet</h3></div></div></div><p>
Over the last year the Internet has burst onto the scene, bringing
millions of personal computer users with it. This has been especially
true in the United States, where it is safe to say that the most
influential customers in the market all have Internet access and use it
regularly.
</p><p>
But the impact of the Internet isn't limited to changes in product and
technology design—it's causing a revolution in how computing products
are marketed and sold.
</p><p>
Not so many years ago, Dell Computer started a business in a dorm room,
selling personal computers over the phone. Dell built its business
through this innovation—making it easy for customers to order
custom-configured PCs and have them delivered directly for a great price.
What Dell knew that other industry players didn't was that customers were
becoming more knowledgeable, and better able to make product decisions
themselves.
</p><p>
Looking out onto today's marketplace, it doesn't take much to draw the
parallels between this innovation over the phone lines and the Internet.
But more important, the Internet can provide more customer service than
the phone can provide. The Internet can deliver words, pictures, and
other product information. It can provide links to related products from
any company—a critically important concept in the PC industry. It can
be interactive, working with the user to configure a system, for example.
It can deliver bits directly to the customer's machine, meaning it can
deliver software. And to top it all off, the Internet provides all of
this at a fraction of the cost of any other distribution method.
</p><p>
Because of all of this, it's not a question of whether the Internet will
be used to market and sell PC gear, it's only a question of when. The
answer is today. Expect to see an explosion in this area of the Internet
in 1996, and expect to see Be participating.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id475892"></a>Resellers</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are many configuration and marketing problems that can't be solved
over the phone or the Internet. The latter methods assume that you
already know what you're planning to purchase. But what if you need
expert advice about how to solve problems in a more complex environment
than simply a home or small office?
</p><p>
That's where value-added dealers and resellers (VADs and VARs) come in.
Overall, computer resellers have experienced hard times over the last few
years, as customers have shifted to low-cost channels for single-purchase
and commodity equipment sales—from small resellers, to computer
superstores, and now to the phone and the Internet. But the fact is, the
base of VARs in the US is stronger today than ever and they're solidly
delivering to a wide number of markets.
</p><p>
Why? Because these resellers have focused on specific customer segments
and developed expertise in a wide array of vertical applications. If
you're a growing graphic design firm, for example, it makes sense to turn
to a value-added reseller to gain advice about how to set up an entire
office and to make sure you purchase the right amount of the right
equipment. Avoiding a single purchase mistake can easily overcome any
price difference between a VAR and direct channels—not to mention the
time you can save getting everything up and running. As long as this is
true, there will always be a strong reseller presence in the market.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id475923"></a>The Phone</h3></div></div></div><p>
Last, customers should be able to pick up the phone to order products.
Customer can call a company directly, or they can call a national
reseller (commonly referred to as "mail order").
</p><p>
Phone ordering has no equal in accessibility and convenience. It's often
the least expensive channel as well, matched only by Internet ordering.
The main disadvantage to this channel is its inability to deliver
information—you need to know pretty much exactly what you want before
you call. Don't expect a lot of detailed advice from the operator at the
other end of the line.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id475947"></a>The Be Plan</h3></div></div></div><p>
So where will Be play? Over the long term we plan to make it easy for
customers to purchase Be products through any of these three avenues.
You'll see some differences in our implementation between countries --
the level of channel development differs among nations. But our general
philosophy in distribution is customer-oriented—we should be where our
customers expect to be able to purchase personal computer equipment. It
would be arrogant to make customers come to us.
</p><p>
In the United States, expect to see Be develop the Internet channels and
value-added resellers first. We'll be moving on both fronts in 1996. This
means you'll be able to order directly via the Internet, configuring your
BeBox to your own specs. And you'll be able to purchase a Be System from
a knowledgeable reseller who can provide integration and software
expertise. Be resellers will have full access to Be and our configuration
systems, so they can deliver a high level of service, and get customers
up and running quickly. As we complete these channels, we'll then
implement phone ordering, likely in partnership with our reseller network.
</p><p>
Will you see BeBoxes in your local consumer electronics store or computer
superstore? In the US, these high-tech supermarkets have business models
that depend on high inventory turnover and they're very sensitive to
changes in volume. For this reason, the rise of lower-cost channels such
as phone-ordering and the Internet present a significant challenge. In
addition, the resurgence of competitive VARs in specialized markets
blocks a retreat into customer niches. Needless to say, these
distribution players have many issues to solve in the near future that
may distract them from focusing on emerging players such as Be. I'm sure
some of my colleagues within these superstores will disagree with me (and
can tell me so at markg@be.com). If so we may see some of these outlets
carrying Be products in the future.
</p><p>
Just as Be is taking advantage of changes in the technology landscape,
we're using changes in the business of selling personal computer hardware
and software to help define a new—and hopefully more customer-aligned
—way of distributing products. Stay tuned as we make announcements
throughout 1996 about distribution partnerships.
