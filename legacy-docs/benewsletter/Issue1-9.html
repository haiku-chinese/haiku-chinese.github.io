you in on the details of how the hardware is done.
</p><p>We'll skip the "easy" parts of thinking up a product to build, writing a
business plan, building up a company, and getting funding, and go
straight to the fun parts.
</p><p>First, you need to write specifications and draft block diagrams. This is
where you make your first cut at what kind of and how many I/O slots and
devices you want to include, what chip sets you're going to use, and how
features will be implemented. In other companies this is where you
propose new <acronym class="acronym" title="Application Specific Integrated Circuit">ASIC</acronym>s
and describe their functions. We don't do <acronym class="acronym">ASIC</acronym>s at Be:
Like the PC clone makers, we use commercially available chip sets to do
the job. This does limit our design flexibility, but it removes many of
the cost and schedule risks that could cripple or kill a small company.
Since the BeBox uses both
<acronym class="acronym" title="Peripheral Component Interconnect">PCI</acronym>
and ISA buses, much research was required
to ensure that the BeBox would be compatible with legacy hardware. I dug
through PC system schematics, looked at motherboards and I/O cards, and
even took apart mice and joysticks to get closer to the hardware. About
this time I started to joke that "I'm not a computer architect, I'm a
computer archaeologist!"
</p><p>To generate the specs you'll need a word processor and a drawing package.
I used MacWrite Pro and Claris Impact (quickly replaced by Claris Draw).
Remember that eventually you'll use these drawings as GIFs on the
Internet. To make sure they look good at screen resolutions, use a grid
that's compatible with 72 dpi.
</p><p>The spec is sent to those concerned for comment. For us this was the
point where the serial 3 &amp; 4 channels, the second
<acronym class="acronym" title="Music Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</acronym> port, the infrared
ports, and the GeekPort were added.
</p><p>Next you get to figure out the mechanicals, the board outline, and
connector locations. Time for a mechanical
<acronym class="acronym" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</acronym> Package. I used Claris CAD
(no longer available, but well loved) to create accurate drawings of the
board and connectors. These drawings were used to place the parts on the
<acronym class="acronym" title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</acronym> and to design
a prototype chassis for the initial units. This is a
good time to learn about the capabilities of <acronym class="acronym">PCB</acronym> fabrication houses, and
about the raw materials you'll be designing with. The BeBox motherboard
is specifically designed to fit two-up on a 24x18 panel, which is 1/4 of
a 36x48 sheet. The two fit I/O-to-I/O and take up all of the available
space in the 24" dimension.
</p><p>Now it's time to do schematics. I used PADS Logic for Windows from PADS
software. It's not the most advanced or easy-to-use system, but it had
two endearing attributes. One, it worked. Not elegantly, but it worked.
And two, we owned a copy. I've used a half-dozen different schematic
tools in my time, and I find that I can put up with some pretty bad
behavior as long as the tool produces the results I want.
</p><p>We're not done yet. Now it's time to lay out the <acronym class="acronym">PCB</acronym>, to actually create
the artwork used to create each of the layers of the board. For <acronym class="acronym">PCB</acronym> CAD,
we use PADS Perform on Windows. Perform is surprisingly powerful for a
PC-based tool. I've used Cadnetix and, to a lesser extent, Racal Redac on
workstations for board layouts, and Perform compares favorably to both
systems. The user interface is function-key driven, hardly state of the
art, but like a musical instrument, once you learn the commands you don't
need to think about them, you think about what you're doing. The
motherboard was designed first. We chose a conservative technology of
.006" traces with .0065" spacing, along with .012" vias. This permits
nearly any modern fab shop to build the boards. A six-layer board was
started and the highest density area, which contains the BGA (ball grid
array) and processors, was hand routed first. I'm not a big fan of auto
routers, my experience with them on other systems was less than
satisfactory. Each of the boards in the BeBox is hand routed to keep the
critical signals short and to allow for
<acronym class="acronym" title="ElectroMagnetic Interference">EMI</acronym>reduction features, such as
shielding of clock lines. The clocks are all series terminated to create
clean transitions at the destinations.
</p><p>The motherboard has a ground plane, a +5V plane, and one of the inner
signal layers has a sub plane to supply 3.3V to the processors, memory
controller, and
<acronym class="acronym">PCI</acronym>
slots. For the motherboard, parts were placed on the
top side only, to match the manufacturing flow at our assembly house.
It's essential to learn the order and type of machines used to place and
solder the parts on the board, so you predict the assembly order of the
board.
</p><p>The I/O card is a 4-layer board, with islands in the power and ground
planes to provide <acronym class="acronym">EMI</acronym> isolation. Of the two boards, the I/O card has a
higher component density, especially in the GeekPort area. Parts are
placed on both sides of the board, with all of the parts on the back
capable of withstanding wave solder.
</p><p>Since these boards are meant for high-volume production, test points must
be added to allow an in-circuit tester to perform "opens and shorts"
testing on each node. In addition to the through-hole connector pins,
which may be probed, 235 test points were added to the I/O card, and 388
to the motherboard. Remember to keep 0.100" center-to-center spacing on
the test points, so you can use larger (and therefore more reliable) test
points in your fixture.
</p><p>Somewhere along the way you've picked components for your design, which
means you'll need an internal part number for each part, so that you can
have a single reference to multiple vendors' part numbers. Come up with a
numbering scheme that will be easy to use, both for you and for the stock
room. I heard a story once that at a leading Southern California aircraft
company, part numbers were assigned sequentially, with say a rivet having
a number adjacent to an engine cowling. This made the stock room a real
mess, with like parts scattered all over, and if you transposed a number
on a requisition, you were never quite sure what you might get.
</p><p>At this point the first 90 percent of the work is done. In a future
article, I'll talk about the next 90 percent: bring-up, debug, and
verification.

that matters, that people will actually use, and you don't have to be a
giant to do it." Tomich and his partners at Broadhead, Tomich and
Associates in Kensington, California, have been doing contract
programming jobs since they graduated from the University of California
at Berkeley two years ago with degrees in computer science. Mostly,
they've been doing projects related to their clients' use of the Internet
and the world-wide web. Tomich says the BeBox's multiprocessing and
multithreading capabilities make it an exciting machine. But that's not
really his thing, "though I'm sure it has the graphics people drooling,"
he says.
</p><p>What excites Tomich and his partners is that the BeBox has TCP/IP built
in from the ground up. Tomich looks at the BeBox and sees great potential
as an Internet server. "What the BeBox needs is a POP (Post Office
Protocol) server and SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol). That would
get it a long way towards working as a mail server," Tomich says. He's
also considering writing POP client software for the BeBox—something
similar to the popular Eudora program for the Macintosh. Broadhead,
Tomich and Associates has never done a product of its own for the market.
All of its work has been as inside programmers for companies. On the
surface it might not make a lot of business sense to try to enter the
third-party products business on an installed base as small as Be's. On
the other hand there are no giants to compete with and "we can get in
there before it takes off," Tomich says. "Then we'd be the first people
to come out with a key product that will be around forever, sort of like
the Be equivalent of Word for the Macintosh. And there's the thrill of
the BeBox." Tomich says he has no plans to be the Microsoft of the Be
world.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-9"></a>Bungling Bundling</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>A treacherous subject. I was once asked if we'd ever bundle a word
processor with the BeBox. The question came from a developer
understandably anxious to know if his port of an existing word processor
would be met with a special kind of competition: A "free" product bundled
with the BeBox. This is a good opportunity to state our position on the
matter and to solicit feedback.
</p><p>But first, a little history of bundling. It's tempting to assign the
start of bundling to the Macintosh. Originally, it came with three
applications, MacWrite, MacPaint, and MacDraw. The very visible Mac made
the bundling rather visible too. Yet, the Lisa set an earlier example
with its seven applications, and we can be sure there were others before.
</p><p>The naysayers were having a field day: This toy—how could you call a
Macintosh a computer—has no installed base. Therefore, no
self-respecting developer will write software for it. Therefore, it will
never grow an installed base. Sounds familiar. At the time, in order to
break the vicious circle, the powers that were decided to include
application software with the first Macs. The machine would be
immediately useful and these applications would demonstrate what was so
special about the new computer—the word "platform" wasn't used yet in
this context. It did the job.
</p><p>In the early days, when visiting from France, I remember recognizing the
restaurant menus composed with a Mac. Graphics, fonts, MacWrite, and the
ImageWriter were making their mark. The Macintosh could take off without
waiting for Lotus Jazz to ship. Unfortunately, there were three perverse
effects. First, the bundle was allowed to last for too long, thus
discouraging efforts to develop similar applications, especially from the
smaller, more innovative authors and publishers. Second, this form of
protectionism, of monopoly, provided no incentive to the marketplace, no
sense of urgency in improving the bundled products. As a result, MacDraw,
MacPaint, and MacWrite, once they lost their protected 100 percent market
share, never recovered a leadership position. Third, the bundling
involved cushy deals for the authors. Some were Apple employees. Not a
healthy situation. Its complications revisited Apple at the time of the
HyperCard bundle, with the same results all around.
</p><p>If by now you're beginning to think I'm not wholeheartedly committed to
bundles... read on. We've been careful to represent the BeBox as an
infant product, not ready yet for the mainstream, for C++ programmers
only. Some program for themselves, for a project of their own. Some write
code for others, they're software developers. And we've been careful to
state there were no applications initially, thus avoiding the
consequences of the third lie. Yet, with a few hundred machines in the
hands of independent developers, applications are starting to emerge in
early stages of their development. Does it mean we'll yield to the
temptation and bundle a few exemplary programs in order to stimulate
sales and give examples of our product's most attractive features? We
won't need to. This time around, we have the web and, with it, instant
dissemination of information, access to demo versions of new
applications. And an inexpensive, worldwide distribution channel for the
full product. In a slightly modified version of this structure, our
agreement with Metrowerks provides we ship a CodeWarrior starter kit of
the Be native version of their
<acronym class="acronym" title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.
</p><p>"Starter kit" means you must buy the full product for industrial-strength
development. As far as the applets we've developed are concerned, we
intend to leave the better ones with the product—along with source
code on our web site. Thus, if you don't like the way it behaves, have a
go at it. Get the source and remind us of our limitations! Does it mean
we'll never, never bundle an application? One should never say never, of
course, but I seriously doubt you'll see us repeat a Write, Paint, Draw
scenario. And we know how platforms evolve. From time to time, optional
capabilities become part of the system, with varying degrees of success.
Mail integration comes to mind, with PowerTalk, now abandoned, and
Exchange, more successful. Yet Eudora Pro is so good I'm no more likely
to abandon it on my Windows 95 system than on my Mac, recognizing other
users will pick the base system offering, at least on Windows. In other
words, no to Write, perhaps to Exchange—metaphorically speaking only.
Your comments and suggestions are welcome, as always. We're small and
hungry enough to actually use them.
