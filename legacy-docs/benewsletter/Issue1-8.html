If you come from a heavy UNIX background like I do, you may be wondering
just what the Be OS looks like under the hood and how it compares to the
legendary heavy-weight of big-boy operating systems.
</p><p>
As a starting point, let me say right off the bat: The Be OS is not UNIX
nor is it intended to be a UNIX clone. That's not to say that there is no
UNIX compatibility, as we do have a Posix library that's intended to make
it easy to port UNIX application code (and release 1.1d7 will offer a big
leap forward in that area). However, the fundamental abstractions
provided by UNIX and the Be OS are different.
</p><p>
Let's begin with the model of a program. Both the Be OS and UNIX offer
separate address spaces for each "team" ("process" in UNIX-speak). Each
program runs in its own 2-gigabyte memory space and can use as much or as
little of that space as it needs, since the Be OS (like UNIX) offers
virtual memory. Separate address spaces of course mean that each program
is isolated and cannot accidentally rampage through memory.
</p><p>
Unlike most versions of UNIX, the Be OS offers multiple threads of
execution within each team (address space). To create a thread, the Be OS
provides
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheKernelKit_ThreadsAndTeams.html#spawn_thread"><code class="function">spawn_thread()</code></a>.
To create a new team, there's the function
load_executable() (which also creates a default thread to run in that
team). The Be OS has no concept of <code class="function">fork()</code> or <code class="function">exec()</code>, they're instead
implemented in our Posix library.
</p><p>
System calls from a user program are made in the traditional UNIX way of
trapping into the kernel and then jumping to the real code. Since the
only way a user program can get into the kernel is via a trap, our kernel
is more robust because an errant or malicious program can't just jump
into random kernel code and cause damage. The overhead to make a simple
system call is quite low, coming in at just over three microseconds.
</p><p>
The mechanism for IPC in UNIX is traditionally through a pipe or the
System V shared memory and message routines. The main mechanism for IPC
under the Be OS is through named message ports that have a queue for
incoming messages. Be message ports are unidirectional, and the incoming
queue is limited in size to prevent run-away processes from gobbling all
of system memory. We also support shared memory through the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheKernelKit_Areas.html#create_area"><code class="function">create_area()</code></a>
and
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheKernelKit_Areas.html#clone_area"><code class="function">clone_area()</code></a>
system calls, which allow one process to create an area
and another to obtain a mapping to that area. The higher-level library
code uses both message ports and shared memory to enable communication
between threads in different teams.
</p><p>
Another area that the Be OS differs significantly from the traditional
UNIX model is in how it handles files. The Be OS attempts to avoid the
issue of handling path names of arbitrary length by presenting a concept
of a file "ref". A file ref is a unique reference to a file on a given
volume and is independent of the file's path. This avoids dealing with
arbitrarily long pathname and eliminates hard- coded constants, such as
<code class="constant">PATH_MAX</code>, that limit how long a file path can be. Of course the standard
C library and Posix server cooperate to provide a standard pathname-style
interface, so existing code doesn't have to be aware of this.
</p><p>
There are other differences between the Be OS and UNIX, but these are a
few of the highlights. The Be OS is different from UNIX, but that doesn't
imply incompatibility, since our Posix library works to cover the
differences. The features that the Be OS does provide offer a rich base
for building new applications that use multithreading and messaging in a
real <acronym class="acronym">SMP<span style="color: red">&lt;title&gt;Symmetric Multi-Processing&lt;/title&gt;</span></acronym>
environment.
</p><p>
There are still many areas we're working on in the Be OS, and we plan on
enhancing it significantly over time. Release 1.1d7 will contain a number
of enhancements and we'll continue to improve the Be OS as we get more
feedback from developers as to what they need to write even better, more
sophisticated applications.

Here, at Be, we talk to people every day about the Be System—the BeBox
and the Be OS. These people include developers, customers, press, and
resellers, all interested in the potential of the Be System. They have
plenty of questions, and we provide lots of answers. But simmering just
below the surface is always one question: "Are you guys crazy? Who the
heck wants a new computing platform?"
</p><p>
Well, let's get this one out in the open. Conventional wisdom in the
computing industry says that the world has moved towards a few standards
on a limited number platforms (read: one). No company can stand against
the tide, it's a better strategy to ride with it—and that means being
100 percent compatible. To suggest something different is to create
astonishment in your audience. Be was called "renegade" in one recent
article.
</p><p>
If the question is "Who wants a new computing platform?", I'll concede
right now that conventional wisdom is absolutely correct. The answer to
this question is "No one wants a new platform." But before you e-mail me
in agreement or disgust (markg@be.com), please allow me to place another
thought on the table: "Is this the right question to be asking?"
</p><p>
Jean-Louis is fond of saying that the source of product gold mines is
user frustration. And frustration with today's personal computer systems
is growing—among both users and developers. This isn't surprising
since current computer architectures are well over a decade old, and many
of the capabilities users and developers are demanding today simply
weren't considered when these architectures were designed. Further, many
changes have occurred in the industry since these legacy systems first
appeared. A few examples:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Users are increasingly driven by a desire to integrate audio, video,
3-D graphics, and other media types into final publishable works. In
this area, interactivity is the key performance factor—you want to
see the results as you manipulate the data. This requires
high-bandwidth, real-time data throughput and high computational speed.
</p></li><li><p>
The Internet has burst onto the scene, increasing the demand for
communications capabilities in PCs. But more important, the world-wide
web has created a new avenue for publishing interactive information.
Combined with the rise of the CD-ROM and Digital Video Disk (DVD),
we're witnessing the first large-scale change in publishing capability
since the printing press, involving a richer data set than static text
and images. This is increasing the demand for computing power from
those creating the new published works—power to design and serve
web-based material.
</p></li><li><p>
When current architectures were designed, microprocessors were
expensive. The concept of one processor per person was revolutionary.
Thus the software architectures were designed to make the best use of a
single processor in each system. This design philosophy stands today,
even though today's processors are low-priced commodities.
</p></li><li><p>
Collectively we've learned much about software design in the last
decade. Yet this knowledge cannot be fully utilized within the legacy
architectures. The result is a "muting" effect—much of the
performance delivered by new hardware is lost in the overhead inherent
in the legacy systems.
</p></li></ul><p>
A growing class of personal computer users are reaching, and often
surpassing, the limits of today's personal computer architectures.
They're purchasing high-end PCs and then equipping them with expensive
high-performance graphics cards, video I/O cards, accelerators, and other
add-ons, in order to achieve minimally acceptable performance. In
essence, these users are paying extra because of the overhead created by
legacy system design, while receiving systems that are underpowered for
the same reason. These users would purchase high-end workstations if they
could afford them, but most can't. All of this leads to an understandable
level of frustration.
</p><p>
For an industry that has always applauded itself for delivering
ever-increasing processor power, it can be a sobering conclusion: A
growing portion of the personal computing audience is consuming
processing power faster than it's being introduced into the market.
</p><p>
Dataquest estimates that 68 million personal computers will be sold in
1996, in addition to roughly 1 million workstations. And growing at 4.5
times the rate of the overall market is a class of machines Dataquest
calls "PC workstations." These personal computers—delivering
workstation performance at PC prices—will be flying out the door at a
6-million-unit annual click within the next few years. This class of PC
will have tremendous influence on the entire computing market --
impacting workstation design as well as the look and feel of the average
PC.
</p><p>
What will a PC workstation look like? Without a doubt it will implement a
level of processing power above what can be obtained by straight-lining
today's uniprocessor designs. Most analysts project that these machines
will need to be based on multiprocessor designs. The PC workstation will
innately handle high-bandwidth media types such as video and audio and
will be at home on the Internet. In order to maximize the capability and
performance of these systems, many analysts concede that the overhead
within today's legacy operating systems and applications will need to be
reduced. Tomorrow's operating systems will be significantly different
than today's, whether the products have familiar brand names or not. And
these PC workstations will have simplified, modern, object-oriented
programming models allowing developers to concentrate more on their value
added than on system interfaces.
</p><p>
Sound familiar? It should—we've just described the Be System.
</p><p>
Will these PC workstations quickly appear on every user's desk? Not
immediately. Let's be frank, content consumers—including most in the
office automation markets—are not the ones pushing the architectural
limits of PCs today. It's the content creators who are running into
performance barriers. And they're the users to whom performance matters
most—where getting a job done in an hour rather than a day translates
directly into improvement in the bottom line. How many of these people
are out there? Literally millions. We'll talk about some of these types
of customers in future Be Newsletters, but you can probably already guess
some of the potential groups.
</p><p>
Who wants a new platform? No one. But this is an industry-oriented
question. We must think in terms customers' desires and expectations.
Customers think in terms of capabilities, of interactivity, of getting
the job done in the best way possible—as fast as possible. It's better
to ask, "Are there customers whose desires currently exceed the maximum
potential of today's PCs?" and "Do these customers want to wait for
today's PCs to slowly evolve these desired capabilities?" These questions
are more customer-focused, and the answers are more straightforward.
</p><p>
Conventional wisdom states that no company can stand against the tide.
That tide is made up of customer desires and expectations, not product
specs. Where customers demand, companies must go. We at Be don't intend
to stand against the tide, we plan to ride with it. Because riding with
the tide, conventional wisdom tells us, is the best strategy.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-8"></a>Be Developer Profile: Acorde Corporation</h2></div></div></div><p>
To some developers, the BeBox's business potential is still kind of
murky. That comes as no surprise for a platform that's only a few months
old. But other developers look at the BeBox's multiprocessor architecture
and the features of its operating system and find it hard to resist.
</p><p>
Acorde Corporation of Provo, Utah, is an example. Acorde is working on
Apple's CyberDog product—a version of Open Doc for the Internet.
They're also interested in graphics and presentation applications.
</p><p>
But when Acorde looks at the Mac and other operating systems, they see
the past. Indeed, Apple is promising multitasking, multithreading
operating systems with Copland and Gershwin, but they're not here yet. Be
has already delivered.
</p><p>
"We know that the capabilities of the other machines out there are being
stretched," says Stephen Humphrey, Acorde's president. "The Mac is in a
transition to a more modern operating system for the future. But Be gives
us a chance to prototype and work with a platform that has those
capabilities now. And if Be takes off as a multimedia platform, then
we'll be there early."
</p><p>
Humphrey says he and his two associates at Acorde are considering a port
of Open Doc to the Be OS, because the current lack of a component
architecture is a hole in Be's offering. But he's also impressed with
Be's multimedia and Internet capabilities. He considers the Internet to
be the next great publishing platform, and he thinks that Be's hefty
graphics and sound capabilities will present a good opportunity there.
</p><p>
Humphrey started Acorde last October after working on Open Doc at Novell.
He's committed to the idea of a "cottage" company, where people can work
together over the Internet from remote locations.
</p><p>
"The key is that we want to design for the future, rather than the past,
and this is the only way to do it," he says. "It's an opportunity to
architect applications from the ground up that take advantage of
threading capabilities. The more advantage we can get by being on a
cutting-edge OS like Be, the better off we'll be."
</p><p>
Humphrey says he's hoping he can start playing with a BeBox in the near
future and have a prototype product ready by the end of the year. Then
he'll look to see whether there's a market for it.
