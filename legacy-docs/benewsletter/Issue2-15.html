Some of the changes in the DR9 BeOS will be immediately obvious: Faster
boot times, a new Tracker, foreign file system support. But other new
features won't be quite so visible. One of the "invisible" features is
support for IDE on O'Hare-based Macintosh platforms (this includes, most
notably, the Motorola StarMax).
</p><p>
Most Mac motherboards include two IDE controllers. Because the DR9 BeOS
recognizes both master and slave IDE drives, these two controllers can
support four IDE drives. The Mac OS, by contrast, doesn't recognize
slaves, so it can only support two IDE drives. This means, of course,
that if you do add a third or fourth drive to your Mac, these drives will
be "BeOS-only" volumes. When launching the BeOS, you'll be able to boot
from any IDE devices, including the slaves - - if it's a BeOS volume, you
can boot from it.
</p><p>
Another new feature in DR9 is Direct Memory Access (DMA) for IDE hard
drives. With DMA, data transfers (mostly between main memory and a
memory-laden device) occur with as little intervention from the
processor(s) as possible. When a CPU is about to transfer a big chunk of
data, it tells the DMA controller how much data to transfer, where to get
it from, and where to put it. It also sends a DMA instruction to the
target device. The transfer is then performed independently by the
controller; when it's done, the CPU is signaled by an interrupt. Thanks
to Be's multithreaded OS, huge memory transfers don't tie up your entire
machine.
</p><p>
DMA transfers are doubly efficient in that not only are they
asynchronous, they're also not tied to the clock speed of the CPU. Since
the DMA controller takes care of the transfer, a slower CPU can actually
see its IDE access speed increase. File system operations and the
programming of the DMA transfer itself will be no faster than the CPU,
but at least the data copy will depend only on the bus speed.
</p><p>
I tested DMA versus non-DMA performance on a 66 MHz and 133 MHz
<span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™. The access time was rated with iozone, writing and reading a
64 MB file on a blank Quantum Bigfoot 5.25 (1 GB) drive mounted as a Be
file system. The DMA transfers used DMA mode 2.
</p><p>
The results are summarized in the following table. Note that in each set
of (a/b) measurements, "a" is the transfer rate for a lightly loaded CPU,
and "b" is a machine with a heavily loaded CPU.
</p><pre class="screen">
                 Transfer Rates
Test             (MB per Second)
-------------------------------------

66 MHz  Read
With DMA:        (4.2 / 2.7)
Without DMA:     (1.0 / 0.13)

66 MHz Write
With DMA:        (2.8 / 1.7)
Without DMA:     (1.2 / 0.14 )

133 MHz  Read
With DMA:        (4.2 / 3.7)
Without DMA:     (1.4 / 0.35)

133 MHz Write
With DMA:        (2.9 / 2.7)
Without DMA:     (1.5 / 0.45)
</pre><p>
Taken as absolute measurements, the non-DMA numbers are a little bit
misleading: We could have used fast PIO modes, which would have made the
non-DMA transfers faster. But what IS relevant is the drop in access
speed between a (nearly) idle system and a very active system. There's a
60 to 85 percent drop in performance for non-DMA transfers, but DMA
transfers suffer only a 10 to 40 percent hit.
</p><p>
To best use your IDE drives you should be aware of a few things:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
First of all, be wise selecting your IDE cable. IDE specs recommend a
maximum length of 18 inches (total), but the rule is the shorter the
better. IDE cables aren't shielded and have fewer ground lines than a
SCSI cable.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're using only one drive on a bus, configure the drive as a
master (or single), not a slave, or it won't be detected.
</p></li><li><p>
If you have more than one drive, it's better to keep slow drives on
one bus and fast drives on another bus. The driver adapts the bus speed
to the slowest drive present, so it won't take full advantage of your
fast device if it's daisy- chained to a slow one.
</p></li><li><p>
Think your brand new drive is dead? Turn the cable over. Many IDE
cables aren't keyed.
</p></li></ul><p>
As always, take the NEWER!!! FASTER!!! claims that you get from drive
manufacturers with a grain of salt. The other day I got a brand new ATA
32.1 GB hard drive that claimed a 16.6 MB per second data rate. If you
look REALLY close, next to that gigantic red and green "16.6!!!" you can
see a teeny little "instantaneous." The "sustained" (or, shall we way,
"real") data rate was 4.4 to 6.9 MB/s. Add to this the seek time (unless
you're used to having one file per hard drive), and you get the picture.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering2-15-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: Text in the Interface</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Roy</span> <span class="surname">West</span></span></div></div></div><p>
You use text in many places in an application's user interface. But for
style purposes, these can be divided into three kinds: Titles and labels,
lists, and explanatory text. This article provides guidelines for
consistent capitalization and punctuation of these three kinds of text in
your Be applications.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id558054"></a>Titles And Labels</h3></div></div></div><p>
Titles and labels include menu items; labels for icons, buttons, check
boxes, text fields, and other objects; the titles of windows and panels;
and the titles of groups of controls in panels.
</p><p>
Use "title style" capitalization for titles and labels: Capitalize the
first letter of the first and last word in a title; also capitalize the
first letter of all others words in a title, except for prepositions,
articles, and coordinate conjunctions (words such as "and," "or," "but,"
and "for").
</p><p>
Don't end a title with a period, but if the title asks a question or
announces an emergency, it's OK to end the title with a question mark or
exclamation point (use exclamation points sparingly; use them often and
risk crying "wolf" or appearing shrill).
</p><p>
If a menu item or button opens a panel the user must work with to
complete an action started by the menu item or button, append ellipsis
points to its label. Ellipsis points—often mistakenly called
"ellipses"—are a single character that looks like three periods ( ...
). You produce ellipsis points by typing Option-period. Don't emulate
ellipsis points by typing three periods.
</p><p>
For menu items and button labels that take an action (rather than showing
the state of a selection, for example), use verbs that clearly and
succinctly identify the action. For example, in a panel that asks users
whether they want to save changes to a document, it's better to label the
default button "Save" than "OK".
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id558105"></a>Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>
Lists are usually lists of options in panels, with each item in a list
accompanying a radio button, check box, or other control.
</p><p>
Use "sentence-style" punctuation for lists: Capitalize the first letter
only of the first word in each item in the list. Don't end list items
with a period, colon, or other punctuation.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id558125"></a>Explanatory Text</h3></div></div></div><p>
Explanatory text explains options or situations in windows and panels,
such as the larger text in an alert panel that summarizes the situation
that caused the alert panel to open, as well as any smaller text that
gives details. Use "sentence-style" punctuation for explanatory text:
Capitalize the first letter only of the first word in each sentence in
the text. Use complete sentences for explanatory text, and punctuate each
sentence as you would a normal sentence: End each sentence with a period,
question mark, or other terminal punctuation.
</p><p>
To brush up on your spelling and capitalization rules, see The Chicago
Manual of Style (any edition will do) or Words into Type.

Tractors, killers, mission-critical, personal productivity. How about
cool, exciting, fun, thrilling, raise your hair? These are all words that
are used in the software industry to describe... software. Such strong
words for such a soft thing.
</p><p>
We're always in a perpetual state of one-upmanship. Pushing the envelopes
of productivity, practicality, and hyperbole. Well, sometimes you get
into it, and sometimes you just want to do some calculations.
</p><p>
These week we feature on our Web site a spreadsheet program.
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/beware/highlights/sumit.html
</p><p>
Maarten L. Hekkelman produced it, and he did a fine job. A spreadsheet by
any other name would still have revolutionized the computer industry oh
so many years ago. I know we're looking for killers, who drive tractors,
but someone has to keep the tally. It's not glamorous, but without it, we
can't be taken seriously as a solid computing platform. Even DVD
production schedules need some simple computing every once in a while.
</p><p>
Spring really does seem to bring out the best in people. A little
sunshine, a little music, and people are bouncing off the walls,
programming their hearts. Our porting lab is in progress. A small but
enthusiastic group, they're already giving us feedback. When I explained
our OpenDoc-lite features, I received excited gasps and promises to
recast the world's problems into archivable components. Maybe it's
Spring, maybe it's the CEO next door with the Listerine on his desk. I
don't know, but people do tend to get excited.
</p><p>
But Spring is about renewal. New things coming all the time. In the case
of an OS, rebirth and renewal are synonyms for new API, and lost
programming time. So to help make the DR9 transition as quick and
painless as possible, we're already releasing some DR9 sample code:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/calendar_dr9.tgz
</p><p>
This is the good old January sample code migrated to DR9. The code is
simple enough and exhibits few enough DR9 concepts that you should be
able to get something out of it. In particular it shows how to deal with
fonts in a view. Most of the rest of it is unchanged. Among the primary
differences with fonts in DR9 is that we have UTF8 support. And you don't
have to be attached to a view to get the width of a string. There's a new
<code class="classname">BFont</code> object that does some of this for you. Take a look, you'll be
surprised how easy it is. Also note that DR9 is still not shipping, so
this sample may change a little bit before it's all said and done.
</p><p>
I don't remember if it has been six weeks or not, but Yasmin was sick for
one day. As a friend with three children explained it, they are totally
wasted, clingy, and demanding, just long enough to wear you out, then
they recover and are bouncing off the walls, while you lie wasted on the
couch. Well, Spring's recuperative powers are extraordinary, so being
sick won't keep her from walking a mile back from the grocery store.
She'll be 2 in 9 days. And oddly enough, the BeOS will be nearing its
release at the same time. Maybe there's something there. In the mean
time, we're tearing up cement, laying down sod, and getting ready for a
cool and exciting summer at home. What a perfect environment to write
applications. Poolside, near the swing set, with the BeOS dancing under
your fingers running on a Quad DayStar machine!
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-15"></a>The Dream of Push</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
We have another anointed word: Push.
</p><p>
Instead of explicitly logging on to a server, we designate locations,
channels, information sources, whatever—a URL in any event—and the
broadcaster pushes the agreed-upon content to my computer. PointCast was
probably the earliest entrant in the field. Their receiver, a browser
plug-in, can be tuned to a number of customizable channels: The stock
market, sports, and so on. It became so successful, corporate IS managers
complained: The update traffic to the legions of in-house desktops
clogged their networks.
</p><p>
From Netscape to Marimba, Microsoft and a legion of followers, everyone
is pushing today or Real Soon Now. The rush to push has already triggered
a rash of negative comments, either blaming the hype, as usual, or
stating no one needs it, another original reaction. The idea of "tuning"
my desktop to information channels is an attractive one. I have a choice.
I can feel lazy and flip through my usual channels, or I can navigate the
Web, with or without a precise destination. And I can see the old dream
of corporate executives: Up-to-the-minute financial data. Tune to the
secret channel from anywhere in the world, even from your cellular phone.
It will soon get an HTML interpreter, courtesy of Unwired Planet, a
Redwood City start-up developing a dialect of HTML for small wireless
devices. When you look at IP packets and URLs, push isn't very
complicated to implement or simulate.
</p><p>
Of course, there are issues with push other than bandwidth utilization
and littering our desktops. Security is a big one. It's not hard to
design experiments where programs get pushed and activated on my machine.
Upon close examination, the border between data and programs only exists
as a word. Spreadsheet data are in fact programs for an interpreter, as
is HTML. An innocent text file can become a batch program, a rogue word
processor macro, or a script for dial-up networking. Java has been
designed with these issues in mind and avoids many of the more hazardous
situations. Still, as long as a remote computer can deposit data on your
hard disk, with or without your explicit consent, with or without trust
certificates, there's the theoretical possibility of damage, intentional
or not. In practice (not in the media accounts) not much damage has
occurred. We seem to strike a collective balance between security and
ease of use. Just as in credit card use. We no longer hesitate typing
credit card numbers in a field on a Web page. The servers offer decent
security, actually better than the chits we sign in restaurants. More
damage has been caused by innocent program crashes than by malicious
viruses, but they don't make great stories.
</p><p>
Before I leave the subtopic of security, following my Bill Gates quote of
last week, and in order to provide additional perspective on Microsoft
and Java, I can't resist quoting from the addendum to the software
licensing agreement for Windows 95:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Java technology is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured,
or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail- safe performance, such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air
traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapon systems, in
which the failure of Java technology could lead directly to death,
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.</span>”
</p><p>
The above applies to most software in existence today, and I'm sure
lawyers have good reason to suggest such a cautionary note—in general.
But why specifically for Java?
</p><p>
For us, push technology is another step in building the net as an
infrastructure for the electronic distribution of software. Tuned on a
developer's channel, I'll get notified of bugs and updates. At my option,
the updates will download or even install themselves. This might be going
a little far, but the potential is there for an individual to reach as
many potential users as a large corporation, once again making the
Internet a great equalizer.

AKA: Why I think we should use HTML<br />
AKA: Styled Text Exchange(ad- and disadvantages)<br />
AKA: Styled Text in clipboard
</h5></div></div></div><p>
What's the best format for (A) general text markup exchange and (B)
placing styled text on the clipboard?
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
RTF. Provides a good deal of control, and the general spec is
well known and settled. However, it's not great for markup, it
provides "personalizations" (known as "styles") that aren't part of
the commonly defined spec, and it seems that no two implementations
are the same.
</p></li><li><p>
HTML. It's ubiquitous and friendly, but it's not very flexible.
</p></li><li><p>
SGML. Too flexible, say some.
</p></li><li><p>
PDF. The best of breed for layout. But it's big and not well
supported.
</p></li><li><p>
XML and DSSSL (Document Style Semantics and Specification
Language). Between these two (which describe content and layout,
respectively) almost any page can be described. But it's new,
complicated, and the spec is massive.
</p></li></ul><p>
There was some squabbling over how and when text "richness" can and
should be used. For example, does text format richness help the
readability of e-mail? Probably not—the difference between
&lt;bold&gt;Groovy&lt;/bold&gt; and GROOVY! may not be worth the time spent
encoding the HTML.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, do questions (A) and (B) require the same solution? Possibly
not; the clipboard solution can be much "lighter" than the
all-the-bells-and-ponies solution. It was generally accepted that STE
(part of DR9 <code class="classname">BTextView</code>) is the proper format for placing enriched text
on the clipboard.

From Mimir Reynisson:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">How do I increase the stack size allocated to an application?</span>”
</p><p>
You can't. The stack is limited to 64K; this fact o' life was lamented,
but is a more flexible setting necessary? An infinitely growable stack
may not be a toy you want everyone to get their hands on; it could lead
to tailspinning recursion. The next thing you know, the missiles have
been launched by accident and Nebraska is a smoking ruin. (My cousins
live in Nebraska. Nuke 'em.)
</p><p>
On the other hand, it was posited that recursion isn't necessarily a
bad thing: In some circles, recursion is actually considered GOOD
programming. This point bordered on the religious, but it was
mercifully dropped.
</p><p>
The thread also discussed what an app should do to recover from bumping
into the stack size limit, and how (or if) it should inform the user of
the error.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id558508"></a>Subject: File attributes feature request</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">
AKA: node_refs<br />
AKA: record_refs
</h5></div></div></div><p>
Let's say document A (text) imports document B (a picture). When saving
A, you don't want to copy B's data, you simply want a reference to join
the two. How should A refer to B?
</p><p>
It was suggested that if A contained a known, commonly used
(system-defined?) attribute that took a "pointer to" B as its value,
then not only would this solve the reference question, but you could
query on the attribute to find all files that import some other file.
In other words, A would know how to find B, and B would be able to
query for all such A's.
</p><p>
This led to a discussion of what the "pointer to" data should be:
Should it be symbolic (pathname) or "hard" (such as you get with the
pre-DR9 record ref)? If you use a pathname reference, then you break
the link (from A to B) if you move the file. Hard references let you
maintain the link no matter where the referred-to file goes—but do
you really want to refer to B after it's been moved to the trash?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: There was some confusion about what a "node_ref" is; a
node_ref is NOT a record_ref. There is no DR9 analog for the record_ref
