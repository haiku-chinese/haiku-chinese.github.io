When the compiler sees a function, it creates a symbol that encapsulates
the function's prototype. This is called "name mangling"; the mangled
symbol name is how your application's compiled code identifies the
functions that it calls.
</p><p>
It used to be that few application developers needed to worry about how a
function's name was mangled. But as more and more programmers use
"add-ons," the issue of understanding and decoding mangled names becomes
more important. This article explains name mangling basics, how mangling
affects add-ons, and what you can do to make your life (and the lives of
the developers that will load your add-ons) easier.
</p><p>
Here's a simple name-mangling example. Compiling for the PPC, the
Metrowerks compiler turns this function declaration:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">fred</code>(<span class="type">unsigned long</span>, <span class="type">int *</span>);
</pre><p>
into this:
</p><pre class="screen">
fred__FUlPi
</pre><p>
The amusingly euphonious "FUlPi" actually means something:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
"F" indicates that this is a function.
</p></li><li><p>
"Ul" represents the type of the first argument (unsigned long).
</p></li><li><p>
"Pi" (pointer to int) is the type of the second argument.
</p></li></ul><p>
Let's look at an example of a C++ member function:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">foo</code>::<code class="methodname">fred</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span>, <span class="type">short</span>);
</pre><p>
This becomes:
</p><pre class="screen">
fred__3fooFPCcs
</pre><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
"3" is the string length of the class name ("foo").
</p></li><li><p>
"foo" is the class name.
</p></li><li><p>
"F" is the function indicator.
</p></li><li><p>
"PCc" stands for "pointer to const char" (the first argument).
</p></li><li><p>
"s" stands for short (the second argument).
</p></li></ul><p>
Now assume you're writing an add-on in C++. Let's consider first the
simple case of exporting a function. (We'll look at exporting classes
later.)
</p><p>
Here's our add-on source:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// declaration, possibly in a separate header file</span>
#pragma export on
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">fred</code>(<span class="type">unsigned long</span>, <span class="type">int *</span>);
#pragma export reset

<span class="comment">// definition</span>
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">fred</code>(<span class="type">unsigned long</span> <code class="parameter">i</code>, <span class="type">int *</span><code class="parameter">p</code>)
{
    return <code class="parameter">p</code>[<code class="parameter">i</code>];
}
</pre><p>
Here's the code that loads the add-on, does the symbol lookup, and then
invokes the function:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">image_id</span> <code class="varname">imid</code>;
<span class="type">int</span> (*<code class="varname">f</code>)(<span class="type">unsigned long</span>, <span class="type">int*</span>);

static <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">p</code>[] = { 9, 2, 7, 1 };

<span class="comment">// Load the add-on</span>
<code class="varname">imid</code> = <code class="function">load_add_on</code>("my_add_on");
if (<code class="varname">imid</code> &lt; 0) {
  ... <span class="comment">// add-on not found</span>
}

<span class="comment">// Find the symbol for the fred() function</span>
if (<code class="function">get_image_symbol</code>(<code class="varname">imid</code>, "fred__FUlPi",
    <code class="constant">B_SYMBOL_TYPE_TEXT</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">f</code>) !=  <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>) {
  ... <span class="comment">// symbol not found</span>
}

<span class="comment">// Invoke the function</span>
<code class="function">printf</code>("f(%d, %.8x) = %d\n", 1, &amp;<code class="varname">p</code>[0], (*<code class="varname">f</code>)(1, <code class="varname">p</code>));
...
</pre><p>
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">Tres bien</em></span>, you think. But you have sinned in your ignorance. The mangling
scheme that I have just described applies to the PowerPC compiler. It
does not apply to the Metrowerks compiler for Intel. That means you have
just written code that is not portable. Our function <code class="function">fred()</code> would
actually be mangled this way for Intel:
</p><pre class="screen">
?fred@@YAHKPAH@Z
</pre><p>
Just as cryptic as the PPC—and even more fun to say out loud.
</p><p>
The best solution to this problem is to avoid it altogether by
"externing" your add-on functions. The fred() function declaration, for
example, would look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#pragma export on
extern "C" <span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">fred</code>(<span class="type">unsigned long</span>, <span class="type">int *</span>);
#pragma export reset
</pre><p>
The definition remains unchanged.
</p><p>
The lookup code also remains unchanged, with the exception of the symbol
name that is now unmangled:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// Lookup the extern'ed fred() function.</span>
if (<code class="function">get_image_symbol</code>(<code class="varname">imid</code>, "fred",
    <code class="constant">B_SYMBOL_TYPE_TEXT</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">f</code>) !=  <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>)
</pre><p>
This code (when compiled for the target platform) will run on both the
PPC and Intel versions of the BeOS.
</p><p>
Let's now talk about how to export a class from an add-on. Because the
class constructors and destructor are mangled, we cannot invoke them
directly in a portable manner. The solution is to write and export a
function that creates an instance of our class. Of course, this function
needs to be externed to avoid name mangling.
</p><p>
Let's say we want to export a class Pet.
</p><p>
Here's <code class="filename">Pet.h</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">Pet</code> {
  public:
    <code class="methodname">Pet</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>);
    virtual <code class="methodname">~Pet</code>();
    virtual <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="methodname">name</code>();

  private:
    <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">buf</code>[32];
};
</pre><p>
And <code class="filename">Pet.cpp</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "Pet.h"

#pragma export on
extern "C" <span class="type"><code class="classname">Pet</code> *</span> <code class="function">instantiate_pet</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>);
#pragma export reset

<span class="type"><code class="classname">Pet</code> *</span><code class="function">instantiate_pet</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>)
{
  return new <code class="classname">Pet</code>(<code class="parameter">name</code>);
}

<code class="classname">Pet</code>::<code class="methodname">Pet</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>)
{
  <code class="function">strncpy</code>(<code class="varname">buf</code>, <code class="parameter">name</code>, 32);
  <code class="varname">buf</code>[31] = '\0';
}

<code class="classname">Pet</code>::<code class="methodname">~Pet</code>()
{
}

<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="classname">Pet</code>::<code class="methodname">name</code>()
{
  return &amp;<code class="varname">buf</code>[0];
}
</pre><p>
And here's the application code that loads the add-on and instantiates
the object:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include "Pet.h"

...
<span class="type">image_id</span>  <code class="varname">imid</code>;
<span class="type"><code class="classname">Pet</code> *</span><code class="varname">myPet</code>;
<span class="type"><code class="classname">Pet</code> *</span>(*<code class="varname">f</code>)(<span class="type">const char *</span>);

<code class="varname">imid</code> = <code class="function">load_add_on</code>("Pet");
if (<code class="varname">imid</code> &lt; 0) {
   ... <span class="comment">// add-on not found</span>
}

if (<code class="function">get_image_symbol</code>(<code class="varname">imid</code>, "instantiate_pet",
    <code class="constant">B_SYMBOL_TYPE_TEXT</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">f</code>) != <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>)  {
      ... <span class="comment">// symbol not found</span>
}
<code class="varname">myPe</code>t= (*<code class="varname">f</code>)("fido");
<code class="function">printf</code>("pet name is %s\n", <code class="varname">myPet</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">name</code>());
delete <code class="varname">myPet</code>;
...
</pre><p>
Note that only <code class="function">instantiate_pet()</code> is exported from the add-on. Because all
the functions called from the application are <code class="code">virtual</code>
(<code class="classname">Pet</code>::<code class="methodname">~Pet()</code> and
<code class="classname">Pet</code>::<code class="methodname">name()</code>), their invocations go through the virtual table, which is
pointed to by the instantiated object. Therefore no symbol of class Pet
is explicitly referenced by the application.
</p><p>
In a future article, we'll look at a more difficult—and more practical
—example, such as subclassing <code class="classname">BView</code> in an add-on.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering2-48-2"></a>A Remembrance of Things Past: Processor-Independent Device Drivers</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Arve</span> <span class="surname">Hjønnevåg</span></span></div></div></div><p>
If you have previously written or are now writing a device driver for
BeOS you may be interested in learning how to make it work on the
upcoming BeOS for x86 hardware. In order for a driver to work on
different hardware platforms, it must be independent of any special
processor feature. To help you avoid creating dependencies, I've
formulated four general rules for writing device drivers:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Do not use assembly language without providing a fallback for other
processors.
</p></li><li><p>
Use endian-independent code to access external devices.
</p></li><li><p>
Use system functions for all timing and delays.
</p></li><li><p>
Use macros to access ISA I/O.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
If you follow these rules, a simple recompile will make the driver work
on a different processor, in most cases. For further explanation, read on.
</p><p>
First, if you use assembly language, always provide a C version of the
same code and use the preprocessor to include the right code at compile
time. A simple example might look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#if __POWERPC__
__asm <span class="type">long long</span>
<code class="function">longlongzero</code>()
{
  li  r4, 0
  li  r3, 0
  blr
}
#elif __INTEL__
__declspec(naked)
<code class="function">longlongzero</code>()
{
  asm {
    mov  eax, 0
    mov edx, 0
    ret
  }
}
#else
<span class="type">long long</span>
<code class="function">longlongzero</code>()
{
  return 0;
}
#endif
</pre><p>
Second, the device that the driver controls may have commands and
arguments in a specific byte order. Let's say that our device has a
16-bit command register mapped in memory at address MYCMDADDR. The device
expects a command in little endian byte order and it defines two
commands: LAUNCH=0x0100 and DISARM=0x0001.
</p><p>
To make the driver source code processor-independent, use the macro
B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_INT16(arg), defined in
<code class="filename">support/byteorder.h</code>, whenever
you write to the command register:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="function">guard_thread</code>()
{
  while(1) {
    *MYCMDADDR = <code class="function">B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_INT16</code>( DISARM );
    <code class="function">snooze</code>(1000000);
  }
}
</pre><p>
The third item on the checklist is timing. Take a device that has a
command register but provides no acknowledgment that the command has been
received. If a command is written to the command register before the
device reads the first command, the first command will be overwritten.
Since we know, however, that the device processes a command in 5
microseconds, if the driver needs to write two commands, we just put a 5
microsecond delay, spin (5), between the two commands. In cases when the
register is used by different functions, the driver may work fine without
adding any delay—though this is bound to break on a future system.
</p><p>
One way to ensure that no command is missed is by always adding a delay
after sending a command. But although this method always works, it is
only efficient when commands are sent in large chunks. A better way to
solve the problem is by always accessing the command register through one
function. This will add a delay only when it is needed. The following
function shows you how to do this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="function">SendCommand</code>(<span class="type">command_t</span> <code class="parameter">command</code>)
{
  static <span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="varname">lasttime</code> = 0;
  while((lasttime + 5) &gt; <code class="function">system_time</code>()) ;
  *COMMANDADDR = <code class="function">B_HOST_TO_xENDIAN_COMMAND_T</code>(<code class="parameter">command</code>);
  <code class="varname">lasttime</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
}
</pre><p>
Fourth and finally, we need to macro-ize access to ISA I/O. On PowerPC
hardware the ISA I/O space is mapped in memory and can be accessed by
normal memory operations, while the x86 hardware uses special I/O
instructions to do this. The next release of BeOS will have predefined
macros that allow the same code to do ISA I/O on both platforms. These
macros are not defined in PR2, but using your own macros to read and
write to I/O addresses will make the switch easier.
</p><p>
Using macros to access I/O changes the previous example to look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="function">SendCommand</code>(<span class="type">command_t</span> <code class="parameter">command</code>)
{
  static <span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="varname">lasttime</code> = 0;
  while((<code class="varname">lasttime</code> + 5) &gt; <code class="function">system_time</code>()) ;
  <code class="function">ISA_WRITE_COMMAND_T</code>(COMMANDPORT,
                      <code class="function">B_HOST_TO_xENDIAN_COMMAND_T</code>(<code class="parameter">command</code>));
  <code class="varname">lasttime</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
}
</pre><p>
Now, when you receive the next BeOS release, you can define
<code class="function">ISA_WRITE_COMMAND_T</code> to expand to the corresponding system-supplied macro.

"Developers' Workshop" is a new weekly feature that provides answers to
our developers' questions. Each week, a Be technical support or
documentation professional will choose a question (or two) sent in by an
actual developer and provide an answer.
</p><p>
We've created a new section on our website. Please send us your
Newsletter topic suggestions by visiting the website at:
http://www.be.com/developers/suggestion_box.html.
</p><p>
This week's request was sent in by Mrs. Rose Hovick of Seattle,
Washington:
</p><p>
"Can I have an example of a working app that uses the General MIDI
synthesizer?"
</p><p>
Sure. If you make a donation at the $0 dollar level, you can download a
program called Axe from the MIDI section of Be's source code site:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/preview/midi_kit/Axe.zip
</p><p>
Axe is a mindless sound-generating program with a simple, no-help-needed
interface. It displays a round playing field that looks something like a
radar screen; it also displays a two-tiered palette of instruments,
divided into orchestral groups.
</p><p>
Choose an instrument (from the lower palette) and then click in the radar
screen; you've just composed the first note of the rest of your life.
Choose another instrument, click another note. Lather, rinse, repeat.
Don't force the music, it will come to you. It will breathe, expand, and,
frankly, it will sound like garbage. Axe isn't Art.
</p><p>
When you click in the playing field, a little circle appears under the
mouse. When the little red bead that's circling the radar screen passes
by your note circle, a noise is made. The pitch of the noise depends on
how close you are to the center of the radar: Pitch heightens as you
approach the perimeter. To erase a note, click on the little note circle.
To erase everything, hit the space bar.
</p><p>
This all may sound like a joke—and it is, sort of—but it's the kind
of joke that you can waste many hours laughing at. And it comes with
source code so you can make it even funnier. The code isn't heavily
commented, so I'll point out some features and caveats:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Axe uses the big General MIDI synthesizer
(/boot/beos/etc/synth/big_synth.sy). If you don't already have a copy
of the synthesizer, you can download it by going to:
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/products/beos_download/packages.html
</p></li><li><p>
The entire synthesizer file is loaded when the app is launched, so
start-up time takes awhile—ten seconds or so, depending on the speed
of your machine. This is an eternity compared to most apps.
</p></li><li><p>
The two circles within the radar screen designate the C below middle
C (the inner circle) and the C above middle C (the outer circle).
Musically, this is the "sweet zone" for many instruments, although for
our purposes, it's just as interesting to avoid this section—try
dropping a clump of baritone sax notes an octave or two below this zone
for a satisfying growl.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't be timid or discrete. You can't write music with this thing,
all you can do is make noise, so the more notes the better.
</p></li><li><p>
You can't change the speed of the radar's sweep. And, if you're a
code-fiddler, I implore you not to add such a feature. Dogged
periodicity is Axe's most important characteristic. If the frequency of
the sweep were alterable, the illusion would fall apart.
</p></li><li><p>
The menu items aren't connected to anything. I was going to put in
some wire so you could save a "performance," but I forgot to list it as
a goal.
</p></li><li><p>
The cpu-wasting graphics look best in 32-bit.
</p></li></ul><p>
Here's one of my favorite Axe tricks: Lay down a series of low-pitched
timpani notes that circumnavigate the radar. Look for the instruments
called "Halo" and "Manhole" in the "Music FX" section; put in a few of
lines of these in the sweet section—combined, they sound like an angel
with a hangover. Now stare at the center of the radar for awhile (the
"burn in" circles) and pretend you're floating five feet above your body.
Instant near-death experience.

I've been toying with idea of a tongue-in-cheek column in which I would
claim that the Department of Justice was suing us for bundling a browser
with the BeOS. Clearly, in our case (the column would continue), Janet's
hounds weren't sniffing the foul odor of monopolistic abuse of power.
Instead, their warrant was misguided egalitarianism, a posture of
fairness in going after the smallest as well as the mightiest of
offenders.
</p><p>
But with the Bill and Joel (Klein) show entering a dull third act of
highly technical lawyering, my proposed column lost its edge. We'll know
more by Friday, but the smart money is betting on a protracted, confusing
fight that will ultimately be rendered moot by Windows 98 and its
integrated browser.
</p><p>
Regardless of the legal outcome, and even though the integration of
Explorer isn't really "done" yet, we can already recognize the influence
of Web browser UI on general UI ideals. Like it or not, Web browsers are
changing the way desktops look and feel. It may be half-baked, but with
Windows and Explorer we have a large scale experiment in UI integration.
So far, the results are mixed:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The Big Idea was to "seamlessly" integrate all sources of data. My
hard disk and my favorite Web site were to look and feel the same. A
nice idea—but, currently, not a practical one: Remote data could
easily be made to look like the contents of a hard disk, but until
bandwidth limitations are overcome, the "feel" won't be the same.
</p><p>
Of course, we'll have DSL lines or cable modems in a not-too-distant
future but, as a somewhat privileged T-1 user, I can attest to the fact
line speed isn't everything. The entire Web fabric needs an overhaul
before we can fuse the UI paradigms (that's the one and only time I'll
use the "p" word today).
</p></li><li><p>
Conversely, making the contents of a folder look like a Web page
doesn't improve my ability to navigate large amounts of data and, in
some cases, increases the feel of clutter.
</p></li><li><p>
The "Channels" experiment is even less convincing but, as it is even
younger than the browser, we can leave it for another day.

"Push" has been criticized for being nothing more than a classical
client-server interaction in disguise—but isn't disguise the basis
of a UI? E-mail is a very successful push application when you're on a
LAN, and reverts to the original form with a dial-up connection.
Hopefully, with time, we'll become better at sorting out the types of
data we want pushed to our desk and the ones we'd prefer browsing for.
</p></li><li><p>
Some other modest "improvements" have fallen out of browser
integration, such as auto-highlighting when the cursor hovers over an
object, and one-click action (as opposed to selection). Nothing to
criticize here—but these aren't really new. If memory serves, we saw
these with HyperCard ca. 1987.

So, aside from a few nice tweaks, the merger of the browser UI with the
more conventional desktop feels forced. After a while, most users turn
off the Web-like desktop for a simpler, more intuitive icons-and-folders
mode, saving Web mode for Web interaction.

Modality—having different ways to approach different data—has long
been bemoaned as wrong-headed and overly restrictive. An illustrious
computer scientist acquiantance still sports a "NO MODES" license plate.
This was a meaningful protest in the days when the UI controlled (or
"guided," in softspeak) the user. But what we're starting to find, in
this experiment, is that if the context is truly different enough, we
like modes. You can't hammer a nail with a loaf of bread.
