While all computer users know how to boot their machine, very few know
what is happening under the hood. Depending on your operating system, you
may see your machine reboot a dozen times a day, so often that some
companies regard this period of time as valuable commercial property. For
such systems, it may help to observe the congressional hearings before
altering the appearance or function of your boot sequence.
</p><p>
BeOS users, however, should find this article sufficient. It explains
booting in general, how the BeOS boot sequence works on the PC, how it
can be customized for your machine, and demonstrates some common
configurations.
</p><p>
As a starting point, I have chosen March 3, 1982. This is the date on the
following file:
</p><pre class="programlisting asm">
HIGHMEM  = 010000

    clr  r0
1:  mov  (r0)+, HIGHMEM-2(r0)
    cmp  r0, $end
    blo  1b

    add  $HIGHMEM, pc

    mov  $0172526, r0
    clr  (r0)
    mov  $-01000, -(r0)
    mov  $060003, -(r0)
1:  tstb (r0)
    bpl  1b
    clr  pc
end:
</pre><p>
I wrote this bootstrap for the PDP-11. After entering the 18 machine
words (in octal) using the front panel, 512 bytes would be loaded from
9-track tape, followed by Coherent, a UNIX-like operating system.
</p><p>
16 years later, nothing has really changed. Bootstrap code copies itself
to a safe location, jumps there, and loads a larger bootstrap from some
device. This is repeated until the operating system itself is loaded. In
the modern world of code bloat, bootstraps are still written with an old
skill: wringing the most work from the smallest program.
</p><p>
On the PC, the ROM-based BIOS acts as the first bootstrap, saves us the
trouble of entering it by hand. After that, various boot stages are
available. This article is most interested in <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>, written by Werner
Almesberger. This package, and the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> itself, are essential to booting
BeOS.
</p><p>
The following cases have been selected both to illustrate the workings of
the boot process, and to provide practical setups for immediate use. I
have tested each case personally.
</p><div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">Warning</div><div class="graphic"><img class="icon" alt="Warning" width="32" src="images/admonitions/Stop_32.png" /><div class="text"><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>THESE EXPERIMENTS MAY RENDER YOUR DISK UNBOOTABLE.</strong></span>
</p></div></div></div><p>
Before a change to your boot procedure, be sure it matches your disk
partitioning and OS placement. Having a boot floppy for each OS is good
protection, backups are better, and a scratch machine is best.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id681925"></a>Case 1: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; zbeos -&gt; kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>
This is a schematic representation of the simplest boot sequence, and the
one used by Release 3 BeOS. In detail, here are the stages:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>. The code is stored in nonvolatile <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>, and is able to
operate the basic peripherals of a PC. It loads the master boot record
(<acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>): this is sector 0 of the first hard drive (ignoring floppies for
now). If supported by your <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>, this can be a <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> drive.
</p></li><li><p>
The first stage <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> bootstrap. This is the content of the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. It
employs the disk-reading services of the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>.
</p></li><li><p>
The second stage <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> bootstrap. This is located within a Be file
system. This stage is large enough to offer many features, like a boot
menu, and can load large files. It, too, uses the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> to read disks.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="filename">/system/zbeos</code>. This stage prints the "Starting the BeOS boot
sequence" message, does general initialization for the BeOS kernel. It
can operate many more devices than the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>, display a fancy boot
menu, and knows about the various Be-supported file systems. Life is
pretty cozy at this point. It finishes by loading the BeOS kernel.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Stages (1) and (4) know where to find the next stage on the disk. How do
the <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> stages, (2) and (3), know where to go? The answer is a utility
in the <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> package called, confusingly, "lilo". To paraphrase Monty
Python, it's spelled <code class="filename">/bin/lilo</code>, but it's pronounced "map installer." The
map installer analyses each file needed during the boot process, which
can be located on any of your Be file systems. The analysis yields the
<acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> drive number and absolute sector for every sector of the file, and
stores them as a big list in a "map file." The map file itself, as <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>
drive number and starting sector, is stashed in the first stage <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>
bootstrap.
</p><p>
The major side-effect of this approach is the need to run the map
installer whenever a file used in the boot process is moved. This
includes moving a partition and changes to drive parameters in the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>
configuration. The good news is the <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> bootstrap code needs no
knowledge of the file system. Any type of file system supported by BeOS
can host the program and map files.
</p><p>
The map installer is called from the shell command line, and operates
according to instructions from a configuration file. Here is
<code class="filename">/etc/lilo/lilo.conf</code> for Case 1:
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
  install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
  linear
  ignore-table

  image = /system/zbeos
</pre><p>
Here is the command to install the map:
</p><pre class="screen">
lilo -C /etc/lilo/lilo.conf
</pre><p>
The name <code class="filename">/dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw</code> is BeOS
parlance for the master <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym>
drive on the first interface. The "raw" device will ignore any partitions
and target the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. The "linear" and "ignore-table" options are required
at this time: the occasional "Invalid partition table" message can be
ignored.
</p><p>
When run for the first time, "lilo" squirrels away a copy of the original
<acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym> in <code class="filename">/var/lilo/boot.0300</code>. This can be restored using the following
shell command:
</p><pre class="screen">
cp /var/lilo/boot.0300 /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
</pre><p>
Here is the list of files used by <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>:
</p><pre class="screen">
/etc/lilo/lilo.conf
/etc/lilo/boot.b *
/etc/lilo/chain.b *
/var/lilo/map *
/var/lilo/boot.0300
/system/zbeos (and equivalent) *
</pre><p>
If files marked by (*) are moved, remember to run the map installer
again. If you don't, you'll hear about it.
</p><p>
So much for Case 1.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682157"></a>Case 2: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; win95</h3></div></div></div><p>
In Case 1, <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> was used as a program loader, proceeding without delay
from <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> to BeOS. However, <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> can also serve as a boot manager,
permitting you to select which OS to boot. As usual, you must prepare the
configuration file, and run the map installer.
</p><p>
Here is <code class="filename">lilo.conf</code> for Case 2:
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 50
linear
ignore-table

image = /system/zbeos
  label = beos

other = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/0_0
  loader = /etc/lilo/chain.b
  label = w95
</pre><p>
I assume Windows 95 is on the first partition (<code class="filename">0_0</code>). The "label" option
allows you to assign a word to each OS (try to control yourselves). The
"delay" option gives you time to hit the <span class="keysym">Shift</span> key, which starts the
menu. Otherwise, <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> will make a wise decision on your behalf.
</p><p>
If <code class="filename">0_0</code> is not found during map install,
invoke <span class="application">DriveSetup</span>. Then try to
mount the DOS partition. This should cause <code class="filename">0_0</code> to appear.
</p><p>
The "image" designation causes the entire program file to be loaded, and
is compatible with <code class="filename">zbeos</code>, Linux kernels like <code class="filename">vmlinuz</code>, and certain
stand alone programs (see Case 5). The "other" designation causes just
one sector to be loaded, namely the partition boot sector. This is sector
0 of the specified partition, and it customarily contains an OS-specific
bootstrap. Think of it as a per-partition <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. If you're still awake, I'm
sure you see distinct possibilities here.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682255"></a>Case 3: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; LILO' -&gt; linux</h3></div></div></div><p>
<acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> comes from the Linux world, so we would expect the following to work:
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 50
linear
ignore-table

image = /system/zbeos
  label = beos
other = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/0_0
  loader = /etc/lilo/chain.b
  label = linux
</pre><p>
Or maybe not. Did your Linux administrator arrange to have a partition
boot block for your Linux system? If not, this <code class="filename">lilo.conf</code> has made Linux
unbootable. Tsk.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682288"></a>Case 4: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; linux image</h3></div></div></div><p>
If Case 3 leaves you dazed and confused, it probably means <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> on the
Linux side is running the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. However,
we are running the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. There can
be only one.
</p><p>
Rather than lop off each others heads, let BeOS run the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>, copy the
Linux kernel to our file system and add it to our list of bootable images:
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 50
linear
ignore-table

image = /system/zbeos
  label = beos
image = /system/vmlinuz
  label = linux
  root = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/0_0
  read-only
</pre><p>
I will not explain Linux options, except "root".
<code class="filename">/dev/disk/ide/0/master/0_0</code> is the equivalent of
<code class="filename">/dev/hda1</code> on Linux: the
mapping should be obvious. Otherwise, use the Linux major/minor notation,
e.g. 0x0301. You can even specify SCSI drives, so <code class="filename">/dev/sda1</code> is
expressible as 0x0801.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682349"></a>Case 5: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; memtest86</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="application">Memtest86</span> is a cute stand alone program by Chris Brady which performs
extended memory testing. It is available from the usual places.
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 50
linear
ignore-table

image = /system/zbeos
  label = beos
image = /system/memtest86
</pre><p>
When "label" is omitted, <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> creates something sensible.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682380"></a>Case 6: BIOS -&gt; Partition Magic -&gt; LILO -&gt; zbeos -&gt; kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>
We must now face the problem illuminated by Case 4: sometimes we cannot
control the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. For those of you with commercial boot managers, like
<span class="application">Partition Magic</span> or <span class="application">System Commander</span>,
the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym> is in their control.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>'s role, once again, is lowly program loader. The first stage LILO
bootstrap, evicted from the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>, must reside in a partition boot sector.
The partition is determined automatically from the
<code class="filename">/boot</code> file system.
</p><pre class="screen">
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
linear
ignore-table

image = /system/zbeos
</pre><p>
You may override the assumed partition using the "boot" option, but make
sure it belongs to BeOS. Otherwise, you create a spectacle.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682440"></a>Case 7: BIOS -&gt; LILO -&gt; LILO -&gt; zbeos -&gt; kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you are too stingy for a commercial boot manager, and want to take the
ideologically pure path, you are ready for a graduate course in <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>.
</p><p>
The plan is to use <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> as a boot manager,
meaning it runs the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym>. A
configuration file must be prepared and the map installer run.
</p><p>
We also use <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> as a program loader at the partition level. This calls
for a different configuration file and map installation.
</p><p>
By separating these functions, we do not lose face like Linux in Case 3.
The revolving door of upper management in the <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym> suite has no effect on
BeOS booting.
</p><p>
Here is "lilo.conf.partition":
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/1/master/0_0
map = /var/lilo/map.partition
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
linear
ignore-table

disk = /dev/disk/ide/1/master/raw
  bios = 0x81
image = /system/zbeos
  label = beos
</pre><p>
Here is "lilo.conf.mbr":
</p><pre class="screen">
boot = /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
map = /var/lilo/map.mbr
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 50
linear
ignore-table

other = /dev/disk/ide/1/master/0_0
  loader = /etc/lilo/chain.b
  label = lilo2
</pre><p>
Here are the commands to install the maps. Note the order:
</p><pre class="screen">
lilo -C /etc/lilo/lilo.conf.partition
lilo -C /etc/lilo/lilo.conf.mbr
</pre><p>
The scenario has been enlivened by placing the Be file system on the
second IDE interface. A bug in BeOS <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> will surface if your machine has
this configuration, and a CD-ROM drive as slave on the first interface
(<code class="filename">/dev/disk/ide/0/slave/...</code>). The bug relates
to the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> drive numbering
scheme. Fortunately, the "disk" and "bios" options allow you to specify
the <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> drive number explicitly: 0x80 is the first hard drive, 0x81 the
second, and so on.
</p><p>
On a modern <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> hard drives are part of the numbering system. If
your <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> drive is the designated boot device, then it will be 0x80, and
the other drives follow. CDROM drives are not numbered.
</p><p>
Needless to say, problems with <acronym class="acronym">BIOS</acronym> drive numbering will be fixed.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682573"></a>Case 8: BIOS -&gt; zbeos -&gt; kernel</h3></div></div></div><p>
This last example makes no use of <acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym>, but comes in handy if earlier
<acronym class="acronym">LILO</acronym> experiments go horribly wrong.
</p><pre class="screen">
cp /system/zbeos /dev/disk/floppy/raw
</pre><p>
This shell command creates a bootable floppy...you can climb down from
the window now.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682602"></a>Miscellany</h3></div></div></div><p>
For some, a penny saved is a penny earned: partitioning is unnecessary
and wasteful. You can create a Be file system across the bare disk with a
shell command like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
mkbfs /dev/disk/ide/0/master/raw
</pre><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">MBR</acronym> exists, the partition boot sector doesn't. Implications are left
as an exercise for the reader. Reader? Hello?

Greetings, I'm a new face in Newsletter articles. I'm Steven with a "v."
(Not to be confused with Steve Sakoman or Stephen Beaulieu.)
</p><p>
I'm part of the long dark arm of Quality Assurance here at Be. We find
bugs. We reproduce bugs. We investigate some of the bugs you submit. We
don't fix them or assign priorities.
</p><p>
Given my rich experience with all sort of bugs, that's what I'll be
talking about in today's article.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id682691"></a>Welcome to Release 3 and Writing Better Bug Reports</h3></div></div></div><p>
While we do our best to hunt down bugs and clear them up, there are bound
to be a few that escaped in our latest release. You can help out in the
bug wars in a variety of ways. The first and foremost is by writing a
good bug report.
</p><p>
Whether you're a registered developer who submits bugs via the special
bug submission page on our web site, or you're a regular user who wants
to see an annoying bug you found get squashed, your bug is important. To
give your bug the best possible chance of being fixed, here are some
guidelines to keep in mind when you submit a bug report.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Make sure your bug is reproducible. Try it again on your hardware.
Try it on someone else's hardware if you can. If you think it's
related to a specific piece of hardware try to swap it out to verify,
assuming that it was a hardware fault.
</p><p>
Make sure the bug is reproducible when you've rebooted cleanly. (This
would clarify that the death of the app_server when you used Telnet
was actually caused by a third-party Foobar program that failed
inelegantly in another Workspace, and it started gobbling up
resources, which started a slow spiral of death, which happened to
culminate when you ran Telnet that day, rather than just being a
Telnet bug.)
</p></li><li><p>
If the bug is reproducible, remember to include your hardware and
software configuration information, including what version of BeOS you
are running, and what other applications need to be running to
reproduce it. Keep it simple, try to make the bug reproduce in as few
steps as possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Write the bug report in painfully clear and concise steps.
Elaborate on everything and anything you think might help us reproduce
your problem. Doug Wright spoke about this Newsletter Issue 101,
Developer Workshop: Bring Your Own Bugs:
</p><p>
www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue101.html#Workshop

If you're getting a debug terminal, or you have serial debugging
output enabled, you'll want to install your xMAP files. They're on the
CDs in optional/xmaps. They'll also be on your hard disk if you
installed the optional items, though they will still need to be
installed.
</p><p>
The <code class="filename">kernel_*.xMAP</code> file goes in
<code class="filename">/system</code>, and the other
<code class="filename">xMAP</code> files go in
<code class="filename">/system/lib</code>. You'll need
to reboot to make use of them. They're also
useful in your own debugging, so they're good to install anyway.
They're included on Release 3 for both PPC and Intel, and were on the
PR2 CD. They're different for every release, so keep that in mind.
They need to match the libraries, applications, and kernels you have
available. If the <code class="filename">xMAP</code> file isn't current, delete it—it's less
confusing than having an old one.
</p><p>
How do you tell if an <code class="filename">xMAP</code> file is not current? Because of the way
things are built and the fact that we do not date-stamp the world,
<code class="filename">xMAP</code> files have slightly different times than the output file (shared
libraries, applications, the kernel, etc.). Typically, the date-stamp
of the <code class="filename">xMAP</code> files will be after the output file, though this might not
always be the case. If you take them from the BeOS CD you installed
from, they will be valid.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're getting a debug terminal we could also happily use the
output of the "sc" command. These are useful to us, regardless of
whether <code class="filename">xMAP</code>s were installed. (It's just
easier for us if the <code class="filename">xMAP</code>s
were installed, 'tis all.)
</p></li><li><p>
If you're getting dropped in to the kernel debugger (which I'll
talk about shortly) we'll want the output of more commands. First,
we'll want "sc", then "regs", and finish off with a nice "ps". This
could get long, and most of the time we need only one if you've proven
to yourself that it's a reproducible bug.
</p></li><li><p>
To be sure you haven't overlooked anything, after you've typed in
the bug, but before you've submitted it, reread it and add more
information so that it's Reproducible, Clear, and Concise, and Has All
the Proper Information.

Make sure the machine that's going to receive serial debug output is
turned on and has the appropriate software running.
</p></li><li><p>
Make sure your cables are connected.
</p></li><li><p>
Start up the BeOS machine you need to test.
</p></li><li><p>
Depending on the receiving hardware, do one of the following:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
On BeBoxes press the F1 key and hold it, just after the BeOS logo
starts to swirl.
</p></li><li><p>
On PPCs press the "delete" key and hold it, just after the BeOS
logo starts to swirl. (Please note: This is the "delete" key that's
labeled "backspace" on PC-style keyboards.)
</p></li><li><p>
On Intel press the F1 key and hold it after you first see the
boot-loader message.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>
If you did it right, you should start seeing debug output, before you
get the BeOS boot menu.
</p></li><li><p>
If you got the boot menu and no output, you either pressed the key too
late, or (more likely) you don't have your cable or comm settings quite
right.
</p></li><li><p>
If you didn't get the boot menu at all, you probably pressed the key
too early. (You might also have a rare keyboard which doesn't send the
key back as expected under this circumstance.) You could try breaking
into the kernel debugger, but I recommend rebooting and trying again,
as it's much easier to check your settings when you have serial
debugging on and are in the boot menu.
</p></li><li><p>
To check to see that you are connected properly, Select "Rescan" from
the menu. If you are currently connected properly, you should start
receiving a stream of messages.
</p></li><li><p>
Select your boot volume and continue as normal.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id683063"></a>Dropping into the kernel debugger</h3></div></div></div><p>
Provided that you have the appropriate cables already installed,
(preferably verified that they are functioning properly), you can drop
into the kernel debugger at any time.
</p><p>
Why drop in to the kernel debugger? A number of reasons, actually,
including the following:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You want serial debug output, but you forgot to start it at boot time.
</p></li><li><p>
Your machine is hung, has died, or otherwise has ceased functioning,
and you want to see what programs were running so you know who to blame.
</p></li><li><p>
You suspect your app_server has died, and have no way to Telnet in
and verify. (This might be the case if your display wasn't updating, or
had gone whacko, though it was still doing hard drive accesses.)
</p></li><li><p>
The serial debug output says something bad happened, and you want to
gather some more information to send in your bug report.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id683114"></a>How to drop in to the kernel debugger</h3></div></div></div><p>
On BeBoxes press the right-most button on the front of the case. On Power
Macs press <span class="keysym">Command</span>+<span class="keysym">Power On</span>.
On Intel machines press
<span class="keysym">Alt</span>+<span class="keysym">SysReq</span> (also
known as <span class="keysym">Alt</span>+<span class="keysym">PrintScreen</span>,
this may change in the future).

Please note: Most, if not all, of the shell commands are designed for use
by kernel engineers. The commands above are all you'll ever need to use,
unless explicitly told otherwise by someone at Be.
</p><p>
Some of the available commands can make your machine lock up, lose data,
and otherwise cause problems, so experiment at your own risk.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id683211"></a>What we at Be want to see from your serial debug output</h3></div></div></div><p>
Typically, we only want the interesting bits of output. If something's
repeated 10,000 times we might want to see one line of what it says, but
we don't want to see all 10,000 repeated lines of it.
</p><p>
We are interested in all conditions that cause the machine to lock up,
entirely or partially.
</p><p>
For degrading conditions or high debug-output conditions, we are
interested in the point at which the output turns from good-normal debug
output to the error output.
</p><p>
If the output starts streaming quickly and you know the machine is dying,
break into the debugger as soon as possible. This allows you to show us
the boundary between the good/bad debug output. (Please note, however,
that it's normal to get a lot of output while booting, or while
rescanning the device buses.)
</p><p>
Most of the time, giving us the last five lines of the debug output, the
output of "sc", and a reproducible test case provides enough output that
we'll be able to know what the problem is, (if you want to be extra safe
or if the bug is hard to reproduce, include the output of "reg" and
"sc"), and often tells us where the problem is and possibly even how to
fix it.
</p><p>
The better the test case, (remember: reproducible, simple, clear, and
concise), the less you need to worry about the serial debugging output,
and the easier it is for us to track down the bugs and fix them.

This week we have the pleasure of fielding a slew of questions regarding
<code class="classname">BBitmap</code>. These questions come to us courtesy of a little known
development house, B&amp;B Technologies, down in Highland, Texas. Lead
developer Ms. Lolita grouses:
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id683310"></a><a id="id683312"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Setting pixels in the bitmap is sloooooowwww. How can you guys call
yourselves the Media OS? Here's our function for the B_CMAP8 case:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">set_pixel8</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code> *</span><code class="parameter">bitmap</code>, <span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">x</code>, <span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">y</code>, <span class="type">uchar8</span> <code class="parameter">color</code>)
{
  <code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetBits</code>(&amp;<code class="parameter">color</code>, 1,
    <code class="parameter">y</code>*<code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BytesPerRow</code>()+<code class="parameter">x</code>, <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code>);
}
</pre></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<code class="methodname">SetBits()</code> is a tool intended for importing rather than manipulating
images. You were understandably bamboozled by its somewhat misleading
name. Setting the color of a pixel is best accomplished with a cocktail
composed of a healthy medley of <code class="methodname">Bits()</code> and
<code class="methodname">BytesPerRow()</code> (mmm...tastier than nachos):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">set_pixel8</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code> *</span><code class="parameter">bitmap</code>, <span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">x</code>, <span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">y</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">color</code>)
{
  *((<span class="type">uint8 *</span>)<code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bits</code>() +
    <code class="parameter">y</code>*<code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BytesPerRow</code>() + <code class="parameter">x</code>) = <code class="parameter">color</code>;
}
</pre><p>
In other words, think of a <code class="classname">BBitmap</code> as nothing more than a pixel buffer.
Nothing requires you to draw pixels one at a time; you'll probably find
it more convenient and more efficient to work directly with the pointer.
For example, setting the buffer to white requires nothing more than:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="function">memset</code>(<code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bits</code>(), 0, <code class="parameter">bitmap</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BitsLength</code>());
</pre><p>
Of course, you must always be aware of the color space of the BBitmap
when directly altering its contents. <code class="methodname">SetBits()</code> may prove itself useful by
allowing you to normalize the color space to one understood by your
rendering methods.
</p><p>
The other engineer on the project, the lovely Ms. Tanqueray, upon
observing this interchange, gracefully retorts:
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id683543"></a><a id="id683545"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
You mean I have to draw everything myself as I did in the days of
yore? What a crock! You should all be fired!
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
If you're drawing polygons or ellipses or any other primitive found in
<code class="classname">BView</code>, you always have the option of attaching a
<code class="classname">BView</code> to the <code class="classname">BBitmap</code> and
using our preexisting rendering methods. And, of course, you can always
manhandle the bits directly even if a <code class="classname">BView</code> has been attached to the
<code class="classname">BBitmap</code>.
</p><p>
After some experimentation, Ms. Tanqueray returns with further BBitmap
comments:
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id683586"></a><a id="id683588"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
<code class="methodname">SetBits()</code> is broken. This code is supposed to
convert a <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> bitmap
into a <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code>, but all I get is a garbled Technicolor mess!
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BBitmap</code> <code class="varname">source32</code>(<code class="varname">bounds</code>, <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code>);
<code class="classname">BBitmap</code> <code class="varname">dest8</code>(<code class="varname">bounds</code>, <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code>);

<code class="varname">dest8</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetBits</code>(<code class="varname">source32</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bits</code>(),
  <code class="varname">source32</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BitsLength</code>()/4, 0, <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code>);
</pre><p>
Would you boys kindly explain what's going on?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Surprisingly, the Be Book provides insight into this problem:
</p><p>
"If the color space mode is <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code>, the data should be triplets of three
8-bit components—red, green, and blue, in that order—without an
alpha component. Although stored as 32-bit quantities with the components
in BGRA order, the input data is only 24 bits in RGB order."
</p><p>
In other words, <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> indicates data in
<code class="constant">B_RGB24</code> order. As a further
caution (some might call this a caveat or something), notice how the Be
Book craftily avoids any mention of 15-bit, 16-bit, and big-endian color
spaces. This is our subtle way of covering up <code class="methodname">SetBits()</code>'s inability to
interpret these spaces as sources or as destinations. Conversions
involving these spaces will have to be performed by hand just as in the
days of yore.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
To summarize:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
In most respects, a <code class="classname">BBitmap</code> is nothing more than a buffer of pixel
data. Setting individual pixels is best performed with the pointer to
the buffer returned by <code class="methodname">Bits()</code>. All you DOS people, think segment
0xA000.
</p></li><li><p>
Drawing into a <code class="classname">BBitmap</code> may be facilitated by
attaching a <code class="classname">BView</code>,
which in no way hampers your ability to directly manipulate the buffer
by hand.
</p></li><li><p>
Importing data from an existing source can be handled by <code class="methodname">SetBits()</code>,
but this function is, unfortunately, not as handy as it might seem at
first, due to constraints on the allowable color spaces.

Last week, Netscape made more noise with its endorsement of Linux than it
did by posting Navigator source code on the specially created
www.mozilla.org site. The official media (The New York Times and others)
took notice. They praised the creator, Linus Torvalds, and Linux users
who have made Linux into a successful grassroots Unix, with an installed
base running into the millions worldwide. Five million is the most
commonly used number, but this is difficult to judge, given the product's
freeware roots.
</p><p>
Listening to the radio as I drove around the UCSD campus in the rain this
past week-end, I noticed that NPR gave prominent play to the event and to
the open source software movement. It is nice to see Linux taken
seriously by the mainstream media. Perhaps this signals the arrival of
Linux on the establishment radar. Seen in this light, if Netscape were to
use Linux as their OS platform for enterprise applications, its newfound
acceptance would be validated.
</p><p>
Besides its considerable technical virtues, Linux makes much cultural
sense for Netscape. The Internet culture is rooted in Unix and in
libertarian sharing of software. What better fit for the "liberated"
Navigator than an equally unshackled version of Unix? One observer
contends the Net runs on free software: sendmail, bind, apache and perl,
now we have Linux and Navigator.
</p><p>
In one respect, this results in a re-federation of a very diverse set of
people and code around the two related goals of proliferating free
software and fighting Microsoft's dominance. Salon has an interesting
piece on the topic at www.salonmagazine.com/21st/?st.ne.fd.mnaw. In it,
Eric S. Raymond, coauthor of The New Hacker's Dictionary, makes an
important distinction between "free" and "open"; while one may not always
agree with his perspective, it makes for useful and entertaining reading.
</p><p>
[On a closely related issue, eagle-eyed developers have questioned our
adherence to the Open Software pact in relevant parts of our recent
release such as the bootloader. Specifically, if we use or modify public
domain code, are we putting that source code back into the public domain
as we are obligated to do? We're investigating this as I write this and
will take whatever corrective action is necessary.]
</p><p>
Back to Netscape, endorsing Linux would complete the manoeuvre started
with opening Navigator sources in response to Microsoft's bundling a free
browser with Windows. The move accentuates the polarization of the
software world. On the right, Microsoft, its proprietary products and its
well-publicized business practices, on the left, open software constantly
improved by the myriad supporting and sharing programmers.
</p><p>
But, for Netscape, Linux could offer advantages beyond the technical,
cultural or political. Consider Netscape's predicament in the enterprise
space where Windows NT has been making rather successful inroads.
Whenever Netscape succeeds with a product running on Windows NT, there is
the risk Microsoft will "climb up their tail pipe," so to speak, by
bundling a "free" competitor with the OS as they did with the browser.
With Linux, there's nothing of that nature to fear—no one will try and
use their control of the OS platform to diminish the prospects of a
successful Netscape application.
</p><p>
Is this idle speculation? Perhaps, but note the accent in recent public
pronouncements on "open" standards. A little less obvious is the
de-emphasis on the "official" Java, because of platform control issues,
again. On the Mozilla site, at www.mozilla.org/blue-sky/jvm.html, there
is a clear appeal: "It's critical that Mozilla embed a robust, fast, free
JVM as quickly as possible. There is no robust, fast, free JVM."
</p><p>
We'd like that too.
