Our latest release, DR8, should be in everyone's hands by now. What I'd
like to do is point out a few of the subtler changes in DR8 that might
otherwise get overlooked. As a developer myself, I know that it's easy to
get accustomed to a certain feature set and API, overlooking new and
potentially better APIs.
</p><p>
The first change I'd like to discuss deals with view attributes and how
they're handled in the BeOS. By view attribute I mean all the various
graphical attributes of a view, including high color, low color, pen
size, and font. I'd bet that anyone who's ever written a graphical Be
application has overridden the <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow</code> method in order to
set the value of some view attribute. While it might seem natural to
initialize these attributes in the view constructor, in releases prior to
DR8 this was not possible because a connection to the Application Server
was required, and this connection doesn't exist until the view is
attached to a window. More than one of you have politely suggested that
we could improve our system by eliminating this restriction. We always
try to listen and in this case we did: In DR8 I removed this restriction.
Now you can set the attributes of a view at any time, even before the
view is added to a window.
</p><p>
I'm pointing this out because many folks have probably become accustomed
to overriding <code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code>, so they continue doing so even if
there's a simpler way. Breaking that habit ought to make it even easier
to program the BeOS. Just set whatever attribute you want in the view
constructor. In DR9, as a further improvement, I added a cache for all
the attributes. Previously calls like <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code> and <code class="methodname">HighColor()</code> required a
call to the Application Server. With the cache in place the Application
Server isn't needed, so these getter functions are much faster. This
means that you don't have to worry about calling too many getters inside
of an update, and you don't have to implement your own caching, the
system does it for you.
</p><p>
Another new feature in DR8 that I'd like to point out is keyboard
navigation. Here at Be we love the mouse, but we also love the keyboard.
We've always supported the idea of allowing complete control of the
machine via the keyboard, without sacrificing ease of use via the mouse.
I might add that a rather influential person at Be has long been the
biggest proponent of keyboard navigation (his title is CEO).
</p><p>
Menu bars have been navigable via the keyboard from day one, but it took
until DR8 to extend this functionality to include controls. New in DR8 is
the ability to navigate the controls in a panel from the keyboard. Here
are the basic rules of this UI:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The "current" or "active" control is graphically marked with some
indicator. This is often done by underlining the control label or
drawing a box around the control. For your own custom controls we
encourage you to use a similar UI.
</p></li><li><p>
Here's a description of the keys used by the system:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><span class="keysym">spacebar</span></td><td>Activate the current control (often like a mouse click).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="keysym">Tab</span></td><td>Goes forward to the next control.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="keysym">Shift</span>+<span class="keysym">Tab</span></td><td>Goes backward to the previous control.</td></tr><tr><td>arrow keys</td><td>
For some complex controls the arrow keys
are used to navigate within the control
itself. See the Color panel in the Menu
preferences application: You use the arrow
keys to select a color within the color
picker.
</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li><p>
The order of the controls is defined by the order in which the
controls are added to the parent view or window.
</p></li><li><p>
A new view flag, <code class="constant">B_NAVIGABLE</code>, is used to indicate navigable views.
</p></li></ul><p>
For more information on keyboard navigation, and on getting your own
custom control working in this system take a look at the Interface Kit
chapter of The Be Book
</p><p>
In DR9 keyboard navigation will be extended to include the notion of
groups of controls. With this new feature you'll be able to jump from
group to group simply by pressing
<span class="keysym">Control</span>+<span class="keysym">Tab</span>. This will make it easier
to navigate a complex panel with lots of controls. The API for creating a
group of controls is very simple. I didn't want to force developers to
redo how you're laying out panels, so adding this functionality had to be
simple. All you do to create a group is to set the <code class="constant">B_NAVIGATE_JUMP</code> flag
in the appropriate view. If your group of controls has a common parent
view (like a <code class="classname">BBox</code>), then simply set the JUMP flag in that parent view.
The <code class="classname">BBox</code> class defaults to having that flag set. If your group of
controls doesn't have a unique parent, then set the JUMP flag in the
first control in the group. It's that simple.
</p><p>
I hope this helps you take advantage of some of the new features of DR8
and the upcoming DR9 release.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering2-1-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: BTW, Did We Mention That...</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Don</span> <span class="surname">Larkin</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Perhaps the most vexing API changes are those that don't present any
outward signs of a change: A function has the same name as before, it
takes the same set of arguments, and its return type is the same—but
it now works somewhat differently than it did in previous releases. We
try to keep such changes to a minimum and to highlight them for you when
they occur. But because they don't show on the surface, they sometimes
slip by unnoticed, even inside Be. Vigilant readers of The Be Book will
note that we were slow to catch the fact that in DR8 a 0 timeout meant 0
microseconds, not an infinite period as it did in DR7. Or that the
drawing code you invoke between <code class="methodname">BeginPicture()</code>
and <code class="methodname">EndPicture()</code> no longer
is rendered on-screen as the picture is recorded.
</p><p>
One subtle change that went unreported for DR8 affects the run-time type
information (<acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym>) macros found in the Support Kit. The macros let a
program discover type information from an unknown object—say an object
stored in a <code class="classname">BList</code> or retrieved from a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, or more
generally any object (such as the current focus view) returned by a
function and typed to a base class. You'd typically use the macros to
find whether the object can be typed to a more specific class. The
Support Kit currently defines four <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> macros:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="function">class_name</code>(<code class="parameter">object</code>) returns the name of the object's class.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">is_instance_of</code>(<code class="parameter">object</code>, <code class="parameter">class</code>) returns <code class="constant">TRUE</code> if the object is a direct
instance of the target class, and <code class="constant">FALSE</code> if not.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">is_kind_of</code>(<code class="parameter">object</code>, <code class="parameter">class</code>)
returns <code class="constant">TRUE</code> if the object is an instance
of or inherits from the target class, and <code class="constant">FALSE</code> if not.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">cast_as</code>(<code class="parameter">object</code>, <code class="parameter">class</code>)
returns the object cast to the target class if
it's safe to do so, and <code class="constant">NULL</code> if not.
</p></li></ul><p>
Originally, these macros rested on a class-information system invented by
Peter Potrebic and implemented as part of the BeOS. That system was
abandoned in DR8 in favor of the <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> system that's now part of the C++
language and supported by the Metrowerks compiler. The macros didn't
change, but the new implementation subtly altered the behavior of two of
them—<code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> and <code class="function">cast_as()</code>.
</p><p>
The original <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> system supported two styles of programming with these
macros. You could use the <code class="function">cast_as()</code> macro to cast a retrieved object to a
target type:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">MyView</code> *</span><code class="varname">mv</code>;
    . . .
    case <code class="constant">WHATEVER</code>:
        <code class="varname">mv</code> = <code class="function">cast_as</code>(<code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindObject</code>("source"), MyView);
        if ( <code class="varname">mv</code> )
            <code class="varname">mv</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">DoWhatMyViewsDo</code>();
        break;
    . . .
}
</pre><p>
or you could arbitrarily cast the object to a target type and then use
the <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> macro to see if the cast was correct:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">MyView</code> *</span><code class="varname">mv</code>;
    . . .
    case <code class="constant">WHATEVER</code>:
        <code class="varname">mv</code> =  (<span class="type"><code class="classname">MyView</code> *</span>)<code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindObject</code>("source");
        if ( <code class="varname">mv</code> &amp;&amp; <code class="function">is_kind_of</code>(<code class="varname">mv</code>, <code class="classname">MyView</code>) )
            <code class="varname">mv</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">DoWhatMyViewsDo</code>();
        break;
    . . .
}
</pre><p>
This second style is no longer supported and, in fact, should no longer
be considered good programming practice. The general rule is that the
declared type of an object must _always_ be accurate; an object should be
typed only to its own class or to a class that it inherits from. If the
declared type isn't accurate, as it may not be when <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> is
called in the code above, the <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> macros can't be trusted to rescue the
situation. In the above example, <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code>
will always return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>, no
matter what the "source" object really is.
</p><p>
In their new guises, both <code class="function">cast_as()</code> and
<code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> are based on the C++
<code class="function">dynamic_cast()</code> operator and they reflect its behavior. To talk about its
behavior without getting too tongue-tied, let's adopt the following
shorthand terms for an object's type:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The "real" type of an object is its type on construction. For
example, if you construct an instance of the <code class="classname">BButton</code> class, <code class="classname">BButton</code> is
its real type.
</p></li><li><p>
The "declared" type of an object is the type label it currently
bears. For example, if you get a <code class="classname">BButton</code> object from a function that
returns a <code class="classname">BView</code> (such as
<code class="classname">BWindow</code>'s <code class="methodname">FocusView()</code>
function), <code class="classname">BView</code> will be
its declared type at that point in the program.
</p></li><li><p>
The "target" type of an object is the type you want to cast it as or
test it against.
</p></li></ul><p>
In the old implementation, the <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> macros compared the target type only
to the object's real type. However, the <code class="function">dynamic_cast()</code> operator considers
the real type only if it has to. It first compares the target type to the
object's declared type. It assumes that the declared type is accurate
(that the object is truly the kind of object it's represented to be) and
it summarily handles the obvious cases: If the target type is the same as
the declared type or if it's a class that the declared type inherits
from, the operation will succeed. Consequently, <code class="function">cast_as()</code> will cast the
object to the target type and <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code>
will return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>, regardless
of the object's real type.
</p><p>
In other words, if the target class is above or at the same level as the
declared class in the inheritance hierarchy, the real class is ignored.
However, you would rarely want to cast an object to a more general type.
Typically, you'd want to discover whether it can be cast to a type that's
more specific than the declared type. For that, it's necessary to look at
the object's real type.
</p><p>
<code class="function">dynamic_cast()</code> considers the real type of the object only if the declared
type doesn't match or derive from the target type. It then makes the same
sort of comparison between the target and real types that it first
attempted between the target and declared types. If the target type is
identical to the real type, or if it's a class that the real type derives
from, the operation succeeds. If not, it fails.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">dynamic_cast()</code> operator and, by extension, the <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> and
<code class="function">cast_as()</code> macros, will produce reliable results as long as objects are
not arbitrarily cast to types that may not be accurate. Despite this
restriction, <code class="function">is_kind_of()</code> remains a useful macro. Use it in a way that
mirrors how <code class="function">cast_as()</code> works—to check the type of an object _before_
casting it, not afterwards. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">BObject</code> *</span><code class="varname">obj</code>;
    . . .
    case <code class="constant">WHATEVER</code>:
        <code class="varname">obj</code> = <code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindObject</code>("source");
        if ( <code class="varname">obj</code> &amp;&amp; <code class="function">is_kind_of</code>(<code class="varname">obj</code>, <code class="classname">MyView</code>) )
            ((<span class="type"><code class="classname">MyView</code> *</span>)<code class="varname">obj</code>)-&gt;<code class="methodname">DoWhatMyViewsDo</code>();
        break;
    . . .
}
</pre><p>
In contrast, the behavior of the <code class="function">class_name()</code> and
<code class="function">is_instance_of()</code> macros
hasn't changed. They're now based on the C++ <code class="function">typeid()</code> operator, which
ignores the declared type of the object and always looks at the real type.
</p><p>
Will the <acronym class="acronym">RTTI</acronym> macros be adjusted again in the future? Probably not. But
if a change is made, we'll try to catch it and report it to you at the
time.

I first became interested in computers when I was in sixth grade. My
father had just purchased a Macintosh Plus, and I spent much of my spare
time creating wondrous graphics in SuperPaint and throwing rocks at
buzzards in Dark Castle. Although I'd been playing with computers since I
was six years old—first a Timex Sinclair 1000 and then a Commodore 64
—it was the Plus that showed me what exciting machines computers can be.
</p><p>
Today I'm a computer science major and a Be developer. For me, the BeOS
has brought back the thrill of discovering computers all over again. My
BeBox has been a source of many an "Oh" and "Ah" since I received it last
May. A couple of days after Christmas I received my "BeOS for Power
Macintosh" CD. My Power Mac 8500, which I'd neglected since I got my
BeBox, has found a new place in my heart. Needless to say, I'm very
interested in seeing multiple 604s in one machine.
</p><p>
So far, I've released four BeOS applications. First, there was BeTetris;
this was my "get to know the OS" project, but I think it turned out
pretty well. Then came AudioDancer, which doesn't seem to work on the
Power Macintosh. And lastly, two little demos, Langston's Ant and a
slightly- more-advanced-than-Be's QuickCam viewer.
</p><p>
Over winter break I started work on a morphing application, called
Metamorph. I need to refine the interface and increase the speed, but you
can expect to see a beta release before the end of January. I'm also
planning to write a Prolog interpreter. I don't expect there to be a huge
demand for such a beast, but I'm personally interested in implementing a
language from scratch, and I grew quite fond of Prolog in one of my
courses last semester.
</p><p>
Programming for the BeOS has been unbelievably easy. I threw together the
core interface for Metamorph in just a few hours. This included loading
JPEG images and a drag-and-drop interface for reordering morph sequences.
Don't even get me started on how easy it is to implement scroll bars. I
almost feel guilty... almost. As a full-time student with limited free
time, I really appreciate the ease with which I can turn an idea into a
working program.
</p><p>
Well, there you have a brief run-down of my little corner in the Be world.
</p><p>
Programs I have developed for BeOS can be found at:
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/sprang/besoft.html
</p><p>
Oh yeah, if I don't get that Be internship I'm hoping for, I wouldn't
mind interning for a third-party that "just" develops Be applications. ;)

At its best, computing on the bleeding edge is akin to a religious
experience. At its worst, it can leave you disoriented, panting, and
disappointed. The bleeding edge is sought by those with a passion to push
the limits in the pursuit of performance that can't be found in the
mainstream. Both the hacker fringe as well as the unafraid end users seek
the bleeding edge as a competitive advantage.
</p><p>
To ride the bleeding edge takes patience, perseverance, and a very thick
skin. The end result for the developer is that the bleeding edge turns
into the leading edge, and they now have a market into which they can
sell a product. The bleeding edge doesn't stay sharp forever. If the
bleeding edge doesn't become the leading edge, then it has simply become
an also-ran. Not a fertile market for the distribution of new fresh
products, but simply a carcass of technologies to be picked at by the
rest of the scavengers in the industry. The leading edge too can suffer a
similar fate. If it doesn't continue innovation, the leading edge also
becomes the backwater of technologies that were.
</p><p>
When I was a youngin, I managed a computer store. This was at a time when
the Macintosh was bleeding-edge, innovative technology. I helped host the
first Mac Fest at UC Berkeley and sold many thousands of these little
mono boxes. People loved them. Compared to the PC of the time, they were
bleeding edge, innovative, easy to use, and just plain cute. History is
now showing us that the Macintosh and its OS have transitioned from
bleeding edge to leading edge, spawning quite a healthy industry around
it. The platform has become so successful that there is now a burgeoning
clone hardware market. This market is screaming for something that's
bleeding edge to show it off.
</p><p>
Several of the Mac clone manufacturers are working on multiprocessor
machines with 2 and 4 processors. These are real screamers! As the rest
of the mainstream market chases the ever-elusive fastest single CPU,
these machines are going to leap from them in performance. At least
that's what they hope. The problem is, they don't have the right OS to
make them really sing. The MacOS, which they're supposed to be
supporting, was never designed for these monsters of computing prowess.
These dual and quad megamachines resemble those cute 9" mono Macs as much
as man resembles an amoeba. But they're expected to run off the same fuel.
</p><p>
Enter the BeOS. Symmetrical multiprocessing, multithreaded, multi... The
BeOS was born for this environment. Be has not produced any machines to
date that don't have more than one processor. We can truly say that the
BeOS was designed, and more importantly, tested in real usage on
multiprocessor machines. The impact of this design and its computational
value are just now becoming clearly understood and utilized.
</p><p>
After I did my stint as a computer reseller, I chased a dream to follow
the NeXT big thing. I became a NeXTStep developer and followed the rise
and fall of yet another bleeding-edge technology. But it never quite
panned out. We had some commercial success, but the market just never
materialized. This particular bleeding edge didn't quite garner enough
popular support, so it didn't make it to the leading edge phase.
</p><p>
The next stop was Taligent. Another bleeding edge, except it sure had a
lot of padding! In hindsight I think they just had too much money and not
a big enough mandate to ship a product, nor a reasonable platform upon
which to ship it. Waiting for Copland and running on AIX just were not
good choices. I was able to file a couple of patents for collaborative
technologies though, and that can't be all bad.
</p><p>
I feel much more comfortable with the BeOS than with any of the other
bleeding-edge platforms of the near past. The company is small. The
product is good and growing better all the time. License agreements are
in place that will ensure a ready market for developer's wares. And from
what I've seen of the new crop of Mac clones, our developers are going to
have quite a fertile ground upon which to place their most
compute-intensive dream applications. Seeing a well-crafted,
multithreaded, interactive 3D walk-through environment running on dual
PowerPC 604s at 225 MHz simply makes the mouth water. And no, you can't
do this at home with the MacOS!
</p><p>
It's the beginning of the year and I'm waxing poetic about my own past
and what I see in the future of my newfound love. I joined Be because the
OS kicks and the BeBox rocks. Seeing all the new hardware coming through
our doors makes me happier all the time that I made the decision to leave
some fading-edge technologies and once again ride the bleeding rail. I
hope all our developers will feel the same when they bring their apps up
on the new crop of hardware. The experience is nothing short of amazing,
and your immediate reaction will be to start burning brain cells trying
to figure out what you're going to do with all that newfound power.

In one respect, NeXT has always played a part in Be's life. When we
started the company, many sages questioned our viability: Look at NeXT,
they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars and couldn't give critical
mass to their platform. And now that NeXT is tucked under Apple's wing,
the question is updated: How can you survive against the combination of
NeXT technology and Apple's market presence?
</p><p>
Let's first address Apple's decision to pick NeXT over Be for the
foundation of its future OS. When Apple approached us in June 1996 with a
request to look at the BeOS, it became obvious we leveraged Apple's rich
heritage of creative media applications. NeXT, on the other hand, had
scored points in the marketplace with enterprise-wide, networked,
mission-critical, custom-programmed applications. Picking NeXT is an
enterprise play for Apple. Compared to NeXT and their more mature
product, at this early stage of our life our platform and our company
have little to offer in the enterprise market against Windows NT, Sun, or
Hewlett-Packard. Our company was founded to address a very different
domain: The computing demands of digital media content creators.
</p><p>
We respect Apple's decision and we thank them for having considered the
BeOS.
</p><p>
Now what do we do? We continue with our work: Building up the BeOS
platform, working with developers and with business partners such as
Metrowerks and Power Computing. Half a dozen ex-NeXT employees work at
Be. With their help, we've gone back and re-analyzed NEXTSTEP. It is
indeed a stable, polished platform, based on UNIX and Display PostScript,
with proven custom programming and, more recently, Web tools. Its UNIX
and Display Postscript heritage limit its performance in the kind of
high-bandwidth, interactive, media-rich applications that are the BeOS'
sweet spot. Furthermore, as is typical with workstation operating
systems, its performance is less attractive on entry-level PC
configurations.
</p><p>
In summary, we have a less mature but more modern, more agile platform;
we do well in creative multimedia applications, while Apple's new OS is
aimed at the enterprise market.
</p><p>
And we continue to add value to Power Mac hardware, and to the PowerPC in
general.
</p><p>
Amateurs of trivia might want to reread the columns I wrote for NeXTWorld
and MacWeek (http://www.macweek.com/mw_1049/op_capsule.html). And, going
back to the beginning of this column, for us, NeXT eloquently
demonstrates that persistence pays off.

BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.

A "preferences server," which would allow distributed access to a
user's settings, was proposed and discussed. Also of interest was the
discussion of an application registry architecture: When you install an
application, how should the system note the new app's existence?
</p><p>
At a slightly lower level, the "granularity" of preference items was
debated. One listener suggested that preferences should be class-based.
In other words, each C++ class (BApplication among them) could have its
own set of preferences.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533119"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533125"></a>Subject: BeOs on a PowerBook 5300?</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Powerbook BeOS must happen</h5></div></div></div><p>
Is a port to the PowerBook crucial? Some folks think it would fill a
gaping hole in the Be product line; others feel that Be should wait for
a more stable (and more surely supported) portable. Perhaps, it has
been suggested, Be should build its own.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533145"></a>Subject: Remote Displays</h4></div></div></div><p>
Regarding remote displays: How difficult would it be (for Be) to allow
messages to be sent to Application Servers that are running on remote
machines? To what extent will the interface API, which assumes a
single, set-in-stone Application Server, have to be altered to allow
the identity of the server to change as an app is running (and,
potentially, being passed between machines)? Conversely, should remote
machines only be used for display (that is, the local Application
Server sends data to a remote display, rather than the local
"connection object" sending ops to a remote Application Server). What
mechanism should be used to deliver environment info to the (remote)
machine that will be launching an app (or "receiving" a running app)?
</p><p>
The discussion slid into a request for a good multi-user action game.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533161"></a>Subject: Suggestion: Dictionary/Spell checker database</h4></div></div></div><p>
How about using the database to store a dictionary, thus making
spell-checking apps (and the like) easy to write and eminently
extensible? Theoretically sound, but it might require too much disk
space (120 MB for a 250,000-word dictionary, by one estimate).
</p><p>
So instead, how about a dictionary server that could run over the
network? (No objections.)

Although this thread started out as a rumor mill/soap box, it offered
some technical debate over the merits of Objective-C (Next) and C++
(everybody else). Some of the observations:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Objective-C isn't a solution to the fragile base class problem
(as is sometimes claimed); it works for methods (member functions)
but doesn't protect the instance variables (data members).
</p></li><li><p>
Objective-C's everything-is-virtual attitude makes for poor
function call performance (it was claimed). However, pointers to
Objective-C methods, which are initially looked up by name, are
cached so that performance improves as the cache "warms up."
</p></li><li><p>
Sending a BeOS C++ BMessage (and waiting for a response) is much
slower than calling an Objective-C method. But (it was countered), is
this a valid comparison?
