Since it's the Holidays, I'll talk about shopping, and save the technical
stuff for my next article. Yes, the Holiday shopping season is in full
swing and many of you are probably wondering what to give to your loved
ones. I have a great solution for you. Why not surprise that special
person on your list with a brand new computer that you built yourself!
Those who can't imagine actually building a computer—or why anyone
would want to—can always go to the nearest electronics store and buy a
PC or shop for a pre-configured one online. But for all the geeks out
there who want to build one with your own two hands, here are some
components that I'd recommend...

</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevWorkshop4-50"></a>Developers' Workshop: My Kingdom for a Euro</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Mikol</span> <span class="surname">Ryon</span></span></div></div></div><p>
The current method of creating or modifying keymaps in BeOS is—how
should I put it?—suboptimal. But today's lesson is a quick and easy
tutorial to introduce readers to the world of BeOS keymaps.
</p><p>
As a simple example, we'll add the Euro symbol to the American keymap.
</p><p>
Using the Keymap preferences tool, (Be Menu-&gt;Preferences-&gt; Keymap), load
the keymap that's closest to your goal. In this case, that is the
American. Next, open a Terminal, type <code class="command">keymap -d &gt; my_new_keymap</code> and hit
return. Insert the name of your choice in place of my_new_keymap. This
will dump the current keymap to an ASCII file that we can edit, reload,
and save as a keymap in the Keymap preferences.
</p><p>
Open my new keymap in your favourite editor. The first thing you'll see
is a representation of the keyboard with each key's hex code. We want to
add the Euro to the "e" key, which we see is key <code class="literal">0x29</code>. Scroll down the
file and find the Key section. It begins like so:
</p><pre class="screen">
# Key       n        s        c       o      os
Key 0x00 =  ''       ''       ''      ''     ''
Key 0x01 = 0x1b     0x1b     0x1b    0x1b   0x1b
Key 0x02 = 0x10     0x10     0x10    0x10   0x10
</pre><p>
Each line is a key value, <code class="literal">0x29</code> for the "e" key for example, and UTF-8
values for the character obtained when the key is pressed with or without
a modifier.
</p><p>
This is where we decide which key, with which (if any) modifier produces
the character we desire. I've decided to add the Euro to the American
keymap, to the <span class="keycap">e</span> key with the
<span class="keysym">Option</span>+<span class="keysym">Shift</span> modifier. That is the "os"
column in our table above. The <span class="keysym">Option</span> key is the right <span class="keysym">Ctrl</span> key on a US
keyboard. Users of other keyboards/keymaps may want to remap the Command,
<span class="keysym">Option</span>, and/or <span class="keysym">Control</span> keys in this section of the keymap file:
</p><pre class="screen">
Version = 3
CapsLock = 0x3b
ScrollLock = 0x0f
NumLock = 0x22
LShift = 0x4b
RShift = 0x56
LCommand = 0x5d
RCommand = 0x5f
LControl = 0x5c
RControl = 0x00
LOption = 0x66
ROption = 0x60
Menu = 0x68
</pre><p>
I chose the
<span class="keysym">Option</span>+<span class="keysym">Shift</span>+<span class="keycap">E</span>
as opposed to the <span class="keysym">Option</span>+<span class="keycap">E</span> alone as the
American keymap has the accent aigu (') already associated with the
<span class="keysym">Option</span>+<span class="keycap">E</span>.
Which reminds me, you may want to consult the Keymap
preferences panel to make sure your additions do not interfere with
another character.
</p><p>
Now find the line in the Key section corresponding to our target, the
letter "e."
</p><pre class="screen">
# Key       n        s       c          o       os
Key 0x29 = 'e'      'E'      0x05     0xc2b4   0xc2b4
</pre><p>
Remember, I decided to use the
<span class="keysym">Option</span>+<span class="keysym">Shift</span> modifier for the Euro, that
is the "os" column of our table. So I change the <code class="literal">0xc2b4</code> (which is the
accent aigu), a duplicate of the "o" column) to <code class="literal">0xe282ac</code>, the Euro.
</p><pre class="screen">
Key 0x29 = 'e'     'E'     0x05    0xc2b4   0xe282ac
</pre><p>
Save your file and reload it with <code class="command">keymap -l my_new_keymap</code>.
</p><p>
Huh? Where did I get the <code class="literal">0xe282ac</code> for the Euro, alert readers ask?
</p><p>
We consult the experts, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.unicode.org/"><span class="trademark">Unicode</span>™</a>.
has all the
characters we need. They also publish a book available from any online
vendor or your favourite old- fashioned book store, "The Unicode
Standard, Version 2.0," by The Unicode Consortium. Or any newer version
as they are produced.
</p><p>
Again the observant reader points out that the Unicode standard gives,
what else, Unicode, while we need UTF-8 values. Converting to and from
Unicode and UTF-8 is not terribly difficult and Unicode.org gives us some
source to do it.
</p><p>
Another option is to take advantage of an obscure bit of Ansi-C, the %lc
and a neat characteristic of more.
</p><p>
We look up the Euro in the Unicode standard and find that it is <code class="literal">0x20AC</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="varname">i</code>=0x20ac;
<code class="function">printf</code>("%x %lc\n", <code class="varname">i</code>, <code class="varname">i</code>);
</pre><p>
This little line will nicely convert from Unicode <code class="literal">0x20ac</code> to UTF-8 for us.
</p><p>
Or, more generally:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">main</code>() {
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code>;

  for(<code class="varname">i</code>=0x0000; <code class="varname">i</code>&lt;0xffff; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
    <code class="function">printf</code>("%x %lc\n", <code class="varname">i</code>, <code class="varname">i</code>);
  }

  return(0);
}
</pre><p>
This bit of code runs through any range you desire, which you can direct
to a file to save as a reference. Two notes, however: this only works on
x86, not PPC, due to compiler differences. Also, if the output of the
code is sent directly to the shell, it will attempt to interpret the
UTF-8 values as characters, making the trick useless. Pipe the output to
"more" and you'll see a line like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ km | more
20ac &lt;E2&gt;&lt;82&gt;&lt;AC&gt;
</pre><p>
So, there is our translation to UTF-8, the <code class="literal">0x20ac</code>
becomes <code class="literal">0xE282AC</code>.
</p><p>
Once your new keymap is loaded, you can save it in the Keymap preferences
panel.

Internet appliances have moved from the fringe of foreseeability to the
center. They're "official" now. Research firms like Forrester, Dataquest,
and Jupiter are already saying that by 2002 or 2003 we'll see a
"crossover"; that is, the point in time when Internet appliance unit
sales start to exceed PC shipments. And these unit sales are big numbers.
A few months ago, Michael Dell predicted 2 billion devices connected to
the Net, of which a "mere" 700 million will be PCs. I like that quote
because it sends several useful messages.
</p><p>
First, PCs aren't going away. They'll remain an important life form, a
general purpose tool serving a broad range of needs for hundreds of
millions of users. This is better than the "post-PC" hype of the now
dated NC exaggerations that doomed PCs, like dinosaurs, to extinction.
Dinosaurs, you'll recall, lasted for more than 100 million years before
they rematerialized as fossil fuel.
</p><p>
Second, this is indeed a new era where all sorts of devices—Web
Companions, NetPCs, PDAs, cell phones, TVs—will be interconnected.
What's new is the numbers, the interconnectedness, and the implied
diversity of devices. In the Internet appliance field, Microsoft is both
a leader and a follower. They showed leadership in acquiring WebTV—a
wonderful name for an Internet appliance, and a well-executed and
modestly successful product.
</p><p>
It seems, however, that using the TV screen as the output device creates
some technical and psychological problems. Technical problems because
standard Web content is created for PC screens and doesn't do well on TVs
whose size and resolution are not compatible. Standard Web content needs
an intermediate infrastructure to reprocess pages before they reach
WebTVs. This is expensive and not always successful. The alternative is
to create WebTV-specific content. And psychological problems because,
well, consider reading your e- mail on a TV screen in the privacy of your
family room. This is not to knock WebTV—it's a good product from a
patient company, worth watching as the genre evolves.
</p><p>
Microsoft also jumps on ideas. RealNetworks is the Internet streaming
leader and, last week, Bill Gates was demonstrating a streaming
appliance. We'll see how "embrace and extend" applies to this domain.
This is merely the latest example after cars, telephones (with and
without wires), and PDAs.
</p><p>
So, Internet appliances are official and universal. This is perhaps
better news than we can yet imagine, or see with our mind's eye. Five
years ago, when the first browsers started to make waves, very few people
had a good "quantitative" idea of the Internet's impact on the PC
industry, let alone on businesses ranging from networking gear to
databases, from servers to investment banking, brokerage firms, pet
supplies, books, and toys. We think we know that now, but we didn't at
the time and there is little reason to think we know any better with yet
another wave enabled by the ones we just rode.
</p><p>
So far, the visible part of the Internet revolution is PCs connected to
telephone lines. Apart from—or thanks to—enormous investments in
the less visible parts, the next manifest ingredients will be broadband,
"always on," and wireless. And of course the continued benefits of
Moore's Law (for an explanation of Moore's Law, see
<a class="xref" href="Issue4-41.html#Gassee4-41" title="The End Is Near!">The End Is Near!</a>).
</p><p>
Let's look at wireless. The term covers a broad range of different user
experiences. It could mean Internet-enabled cell phones and PDAs --
surely a great thing, that would make me love my Palm VII even more.
Wireless also covers the beautiful (and, for me, so American in its
creative abuse of language) oxymoron, wireless cable, or point-to-point
wireless two-way broadband to offices and homes. Lastly, there's wireless
inside homes and offices, such as the 2.4 Ghz connectivity offered by
Proxim, Lucent, and a growing number of other companies. This yields
throughput on the order of 1.6 mbits/s. Now you can have a broadband
connection to your home or office and "finish" the picture by adding
short-range, 100-foot wireless connectivity.
</p><p>
Numbers can't describe the nice feel of untethered broadband, but just
look at the smiles of people using it. The combination of a fat pipe to
the home and a wireless Ethernet inside will create the ocean of IP
packets for the objects of our daily lives to swim in. This, in turn,
makes "always on" a natural. Everything is interconnected all the time.
As John Doerr, the über- VC at Kleiner Perkins, started to say months
ago, describing the always on, broadband "Evernet," this changes
everything again, from programming your VCR, pardon, your TiVo box from
anywhere, to broadband home stereos.
</p><p>
We now see three poles to this new world of appliances: information,
entertainment, and transactions. Picture the three vertices of a
triangle, if you will, or three points on a virtuous circle, if you
prefer. This is the space in which these new appliances exist. If E*Trade
were to deploy Internet appliances for selected customers, they would be
biased towards transactions; a new generation of music systems will be
closer to the entertainment pole; etc... But all these devices require
all three ingredients. You need information to get to what you want to
buy, entertainment helps the selling process, and entertainment itself is
the one type of data we're willing to pay for, unlike stock quotes. Hence
the virtuous circle.
</p><p>
And, of course, this exciting new world is one where Be is uniquely
positioned to unleash the power of broadband and rich media with a unique
combination of small footprint, the modularity and robustness of a modern
OS, and the ability to deal with multiple streams of digital media for a
reliable and seductive user experience.
