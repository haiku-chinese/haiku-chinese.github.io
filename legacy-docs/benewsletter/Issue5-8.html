I'm assembling the free beer distribution of "BeOS 5 Free Version", the
BeOS-in-a-file that can be installed onto and run from a Windows
partition. It's an interesting way to use BeOS, not to mention a clever
use of disk space: Rather than having to repartition, you simply download
a the entire BeOS as a single "image" file and launch it using the BeOS
bootloader. If, later, you decide that BeOS is just for freaks, you can
simply Remove Programs...and you once again have room for the Thief II
demo.
</p><p>
Want to make an image file yourself? Follow me.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id517782"></a>Making an Image File</h3></div></div></div><p>
Creating the BeOS image file is simple. So simple that you can create
your own Beer-in-a-File right there at home. To create an image file, you
have to enter Unixland for a minute. Do this:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=image.be bs=5M count=50
$ mkbfs image.be "BeOS in a File"
</pre><p>
This creates a 250 meg file full of zeros (50 times 5 megabytes), and
transforms the file into a BFS volume. The file *must* be named <code class="filename">image.be</code>
-- the bootloader depends on it.
</p><p>
Next, create a mount point and mount the zero-full <code class="filename">image.be</code> file:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ mkdir /bif
$ mount image.be /bif
</pre><p>
Now you can copy stuff into <code class="filename">/bif</code>
using <span class="application">Tracker</span> (or <span class="application">cp</span>). For the Brie Fear
version, I want the core OS but no extra, so, I copy over everything but
the develop and optional directories. I also want to make the User's
Guide a seperate download to save space, so I'm gonna just delete it from
<code class="filename">/bif/beos/documentation</code> after I'm done copying everything, right? wrong
-- there's a gotcha. Part of the point of using a file full of zeros is
that it compresses well—we're going to distribute this over the Net,
after all. If you copy files into the image and then delete the files,
the filesystem doesn't go in and clear the space where the files
were...it just marks it as available. So, you'd still be compressing a
lot of data that you don't even want. Instead of copying grossly and
deleting finely, you have to copy *exactly* what you want in the first
place.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id517851"></a>Loading and Launching</h3></div></div></div><p>
Now, create a <code class="filename">/BeOS</code> directory at the root of your Window partition, and
copy your <code class="filename">image.be</code> file into it. Boot into Windows, and launch your file
by running the R4.5.2 bootloader. If you don't have the bootloader handy,
here's a copy: ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/experimental/tools/loadbeos.zip
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id517876"></a>So How's it Work?</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you mean the technical details, I don't know—I didn't do it. If you
mean how *well* does it run, it's fast. The only bummer is that due to
the state in which Windows 9x leaves the machine, BeOS-in-a-file only
sees the first processor on your machine.
</p><p>
But why would you want to do any of this? Because sometimes a machine is
used like as a dedicated appliance that runs a single app—you don't
need an entire OS, all you (or your fans) want is a custom installation
of only the pieces of BeOS needed to run your app, all in one small
package. For example, a complete sound editing suite could be assembled
and sold on the Windows market. Smaller scale efforts could be done ala
the old demo scene. Larger efforts could be something like NewTek's
VideoToaster bundled with a couple of Firewire cards and complete
software—perhaps even with a dedicated RAID for video storage.

This may come as a shock, but you will never buy (or borrow or steal) an
"Internet Appliance". Because, to put it bluntly and in one breath, The
Internet Appliance Does Not Exist. Let me explain...
</p><p>
The "IP on Everything" assumption means most objects in our daily lives,
from phones to refrigerators to cars to watches
<sup>[<a id="id517940" href="#ftn.id517940" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>,
<sup>[<a id="id517952" href="#ftn.id517952" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>.
will end up with some
kind of Net connection, with or without wires. Besides being merely
amusing, the Thing+Web game is instructive, for when we line up all of
our fantastic devices (the WebPencil, the WebRiceCooker, the
WebPadAtEyeLevelAboveTheUrinal), we see that the "Internet Appliance"
label is, simply, a checkbox. Net connection is a feature, not a "thing".
And, despite some shared DNA, the thing it mostly is not is the PC.
</p><p>
Identifying a PC—pointing to an object and saying "That is [or is not]
a PC"—is a sensible observation. PC identification is further
simplified by its dearth of variation: They only comes in two colors,
Redmond Teal and Cupertino Rainbow. It was, of course, not always so. If
we push back a few decades, we'll recall that the mini and microcomputer
world was filled with names such as MITS, Cromemco, Alto, South West
Technical Products, Sinclair, Tandy, Commodore, Atari... Furthermore, the
products these companies built weren't as philosophically rigid as their
inheritors would become—just remind yourself that twenty years ago,
IBM was shopping for an OS for its 8086-based computer that was a clone
of the Apple ][ design, down to the cassette player interface.
</p><p>
If we look back at the mess of mini/micro players from those lost days,
and then look into our drawer full of WebPaperClips and WebBreathMints,
and then look up at the two-religion PC world today, and then over and
into the Internet Appliance future, it's tempting to draw the conclusion
that as it did shake out then, so it will shake out tomorrow. That
whereas we can't point to a thing and say "that's an Internet Appliance"
today, we will be able to in the future—because, as we saw in the PC
evolution, the Internet Appliance space will be dominated by two or three
surviving breeds. Tempting, but erroneous.
</p><p>
At its roots, the PC is a multi-purpose tool with most of its flexibility
coming from the application software it can run. As a result of its
software generality, the PC came to assume a small number of hardware
forms. An Internet Appliance, on the other hand, is a task-specific
device (or, less protestantly, a "pleasure-specific device") that draws
upon the flexibility of the contents and applications served up from the
outside through the Web. The individual specificities of these appliances
necessitates a large number of very different incarnations. Thus,
thinking of appliances in the same way we think of PCs misses an
important distinction: There is no such "thing" as an Internet Appliance,
at least not in the way there is a thing called a PC.
</p><p>
A final thought: When looking at this vast, clouded space of Internet
ApplianceS (emphasis on the plural) one must wonder: Will the evolution
of appliances, more than just avoiding the narrowing ruts of PC history,
spawn life forms that are completely unanticipated? I don't know, but I
hope so.

If you think the idea of a net wristwatch—a W-W-Watch—is pushing
it, just take a look at the combination watch/beeper you can buy today,
add some computing power, and your watch now fetch your updated schedule,
messages and download street directions. And so is Dick Tracy reborn as
Vint Cerf (inventor of TCP/IP), midwife'd by Nicolas Hayek
</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id517952" href="#id517952" class="para">2</a>] </sup>
Nicolas Hayek heads the watchmaking consortium SMH, the very Swiss
Société de Mouvements d'Horlogerie, and is widely credited with
inventing the Swatch, originally for Sw(iss W)atch. SMH owns a galaxy of
brands such as Omega, whose high-tech appliances are promoted in James
Bond capers.
