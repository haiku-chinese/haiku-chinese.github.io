Starting with the Genki Beta 6, the kernel is a bit more strict about the
way kernel add-ons, such as drivers and bus managers, use spinlocks and
disable interrupts. In the past, if your driver violated one of the rules
listed below, the kernel wouldn't complain—but you would degrade
performance or even lock up the entire system. Now, if your driver does
the wrong thing, the kernel panics. The solution: Clean up your driver
code.
</p><p>
If you have any questions about the principles described below, don't
hesitate to ask us: mail to devsupport@be.com.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id785610"></a>Spinlocks</h3></div></div></div><p>
Spinlocks are used to synchronize code; so are semaphores. But the way
they achieve this synchronization isn't the same: Spinlocks "busy wait";
semaphores don't. Busy waiting isn't good. However, acquiring a semaphore
while handling an interrupt is forbidden. Therefore:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Use spinlocks to protect the critical section in an interrupt handler
function.
</p></li><li><p>
Use semaphores everywhere else.
</p></li></ul><p>
Spinlock-protected critical sections should be executed with interrupts
disabled. It isn't necessary to explicitly disable interrupts in
spinlock-protected critical sections used only by interrupt handlers,
because they are invoked with interrupts already disabled.
</p><p>
Here's what you can do when you're inside a spinlock:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You can touch hardware registers (through bus managers hooks).
</p></li><li><p>
You can touch memory that's locked down.
</p></li><li><p>
You can call the following functions: kernel: <code class="function">system_time()</code>,
<code class="function">atomic_add()</code>, <code class="function">atomic_or()</code>,
<code class="function">atomic_and()</code> bus managers:
<code class="function">read_io&lt;size&gt;()</code>
<code class="function">write_io&lt;size&gt;()</code>
</p></li></ul><p>
Everything else is forbidden.
</p><p>
Together, everybody: <span class="bold"><strong>EVERYTHING ELSE IS FORBIDDEN</strong></span>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id785710"></a>Disabling Interrupts</h3></div></div></div><p>
The only time you should ever disable interrupts is when you're about to
enter a spinlock-protected critical section. (If you think you need to
disable interrupts for another reason, we'll tell you why you're wrong.
Mail to cyril@be.com.)
</p><p>
If you must disable interrupts, you should re-enable them as quickly as
possible. In no case should you leave interrupts disabled for longer than
50 microseconds. This means that your interrupt handler code—which
runs while interrupts are implicitly disabled—must execute within that
50 microseconds.
</p><p>
If you have interrupts disabled, but you're not inside a spinlock, you
can do these things (in addition to the spinlock-safe calls listed above):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code> with
<code class="constant">B_DO_NO_RESCHEDULE</code> as flags.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">get_sem_count()</code>
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">add_timer()</code>, <code class="function">cancel_timer()</code>
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">dprintf()</code>
</p></li></ul><p>
The principle here is that you absolutely must not block, directly or
indirectly.
</p><p>
If you feel you need to call a function that is not in this list, discuss
it with us at devsupport@be.com

Windows has Tool Tips, Macintosh has Balloon Help, and the BeOS has, er,
well, up to this point, nothing, in the way of context-sensitive help. To
address this shortcoming I've written a ToolTip class that's easily
integrated into a Be application. The Be version of tool tips behaves
more like a Windows Tool Tip than a Macintosh Balloon. In other words, as
you drag the cursor across different areas of a window, a small window
pops up—after a settable delay—below and to the right of the cursor
with a one-line description of the UI element. The tip is displayed until
the cursor is moved again, the window or application is no longer active,
or the settable hold-time is reached.
</p><p>
Source for the <code class="classname">TToolTip</code> class and demo application can be found at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/interface_kit/ToolTips.zip&gt;.
</p><p>
Integrating this class with your application is fairly straightforward.
You'll first need to instantiate a <code class="classname">TToolTip</code> object. In the demo
application provided, you do this in the constructor of the application
and the pointer to the object is cached:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">ToolTipDemoApp</code>::<code class="methodname">ToolTipDemoApp</code>()
               :<code class="classname">BApplication</code>("application/x-vnd.Be-Help"),
                <code class="varname">fPrefWindow</code>(<code class="constant">NULL</code>)
{
    <span class="comment">// set up a rectangle, instantiate and show a new</span>
    (<code class="varname">window</code> = new <code class="classname">ToolTipDemoWindow</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>(100, 80, 300, 152)))-&gt;<code class="methodname">Show</code>();

    <span class="comment">// instantiate the tooltip window but don't show it</span>
    <code class="varname">fToolTip</code> = new <code class="classname">TToolTip</code>();
}
</pre><p>
The next step is to override the <code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code> method of
the application object to forward any <code class="constant">B_SOME_APP_ACTIVATED</code>,
<code class="constant">eToolTipStart</code> or <code class="constant">eToolTipStop</code>
messages to the <code class="classname">TToolTip</code> class:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">ToolTipDemoApp</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
    switch (<code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code>) {
        <span class="comment">// these messages need to be forwarded to the</span>
        <span class="comment">// TToolTip class</span>
        case <code class="constant">B_SOME_APP_ACTIVATED</code>:
        case <code class="constant">eToolTipStart</code>:
        case <code class="constant">eToolTipStop</code>:
            <code class="varname">fToolTip</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="parameter">msg</code>);
            break;
    }
}
</pre><p>
The last step is to replace any <code class="classname">BControl</code> objects (<code class="classname">BButton</code>s,
<code class="classname">BColorControl</code>, <code class="classname">BSlider</code>, etc.)
with the <code class="classname">TToolTipControl</code>s equivalents.
These objects look identical to the base class objects with the exception
of taking a <code class="parameter">tip</code> parameter after all required parameters:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">view</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(new <code class="classname">TToolTipButton</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>(10, 44, 90, 44),
    "tool tip button",
    "Quit", new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code>), "Click this
    button to quit"));

<code class="varname">view</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(new <code class="classname">TToolTipButton</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>(110, 44, 190, 44),
    "tool tip button",
    "Preferences", new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>('PREF'), "Click this
    button to set ToolTip preferences"));
</pre><p>
Views other than <code class="classname">BControl</code>s (<code class="classname">BBox</code>,
<code class="classname">BMenuField</code>, <code class="classname">BListView</code>,
<code class="classname">BView</code>, etc.) can
also take advantage of the <code class="classname">TToolTip</code> class. To do this you'll need to
sub-class the view you're interested in and override the <code class="methodname">MouseMoved()</code>
method. In the constructor of the view, cache the tip string:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">TToolTipButton</code>::<code class="methodname">TToolTipButton</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">rect</code>,
    <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>,
    <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">label</code>,
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>,
    <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">tip</code>,
    <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">resize_mask</code>,
    <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">flags</code>)
   :<code class="classname">BButton</code>(<code class="parameter">rect</code>, <code class="parameter">name</code>, <code class="parameter">label</code>, <code class="parameter">msg</code>, <code class="parameter">resize_mask</code>, <code class="parameter">flags</code>), <code class="varname">fIn</code>(<code class="constant">false</code>)
{
    <span class="comment">// cache the ToolTip string</span>
    <code class="varname">fTip</code> = (<span class="type">char *</span>)<code class="function">malloc</code>(<code class="function">strlen</code>(<code class="parameter">tip</code>) + 1);
    <code class="function">strcpy</code>(<code class="varname">fTip</code>, <code class="parameter">tip</code>);
}
</pre><p>
In the view destructor, stop displaying the tip if it's currently being
displayed and free the cached tip string:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">TToolTipButton</code>::<code class="methodname">~TToolTipButton</code>()
{
    <span class="comment">// kill off any current ToolTip</span>
    if (<code class="varname">fIn</code>)
        <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">eToolTipStop</code>);
    <span class="comment">// free cached ToolTip</span>
    <code class="function">free</code>(<code class="varname">fTip</code>);
}
</pre><p>
In the <code class="methodname">MouseMoved()</code> method, determine whether the cursor is moving into or
out of the view. If it's moving in, build a message that contains the
start point and bounds of the view (both in screen coordinates) and the
tip string, and post it to the application:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// if mouse has moved into our view, our window is active</span>
<span class="comment">// and it previously wasn't in, send a message to start the ToolTip</span>
if ((<code class="methodname">Bounds</code>().<code class="methodname">Contains</code>(<code class="varname">where</code>)) &amp;&amp; (<code class="methodname">Window</code>()-&gt;<code class="methodname">IsActive</code>()))
{
    if (!<code class="varname">fIn</code>) {
        <code class="classname">BMessage</code>    <code class="varname">msg</code>(<code class="constant">eToolTipStart</code>);

        <code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddPoint</code>("start", <code class="methodname">ConvertToScreen</code>(<code class="varname">where</code>));
        <code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddRect</code>("bounds", <code class="methodname">ConvertToScreen</code>(<code class="methodname">Bounds</code>()));
        <code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddString</code>("string", <code class="varname">fTip</code>);
        <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">msg</code>);
        <code class="varname">fIn</code> = <code class="constant">true</code>;
    }
}
</pre><p>
If the mouse is moving out of the view, post an <code class="constant">eToolTipStop</code> message to
the application:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// otherwise stop the message</span>
else if (<code class="varname">fIn</code>) {
    <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">eToolTipStop</code>);
    <code class="varname">fIn</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
}
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">TToollTip</code> class is fully customizable as far as the font (and font
size) used, the delay before the tip is displayed, the duration the tip
is displayed, and most important, whether tool tips are enabled or not.
To get the current settings:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">tool_tip_settings</span> <code class="varname">settings</code>;
<code class="varname">fToolTip</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetSettings</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">settings</code>);
</pre><p>
To apply the new settings:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">fToolTip</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetSettings</code>(<code class="varname">settings</code>);
</pre><p>
tool tip settings is the following structure:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">tool_tip_settings</span> {
    <span class="type">bool</span>        <code class="varname">enabled</code>;
    <span class="comment">// flag whether tips are enables or not</span>

    <span class="type">bool</span>        <code class="varname">one_time_only</code>;
    <span class="comment">// flag to only display the tip once per time in view</span>

    <span class="type">bigtime_t</span>   <code class="varname">delay</code>;
    <span class="comment">// delay before tip is shown in microseconds</span>

    <span class="type">bigtime_t</span>   <code class="varname">hold</code>;
    <span class="comment">// amount of time tip is displayed in microseconds</span>

    <code class="classname">BFont</code>       <code class="varname">font</code>;
    <span class="comment">// font tip is drawn in</span>
};
</pre><p>
Oh yeah, if you're going to add tool-tips to your application, please add
a setting in your preference panel to enable or disable them.

X and I were waiting at the polo field for the rest of the Be
documentation team when we noticed one of the interns running towards us
from the direction of the Be campus, about 26 miles away. He reached us,
held out a piece of papyrus rolled into a tube and stamped with the seal
of Management, clutched his chest, and collapsed. It's nice to see
dedication like that in a summer intern.
</p><p>
X unrolled the papyrus and scanned it quickly. “<span class="quote">Oh, bother,</span>” he said,
“<span class="quote">the developers are restless.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Hmm?</span>” I said, sipping my Louis XIV Remy-Martin cognac. “<span class="quote">What is it this
time?</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The normal tripe. 'All these great new features in the Be operating
system, when do we get the documentation so we can start using them?',
yada, yada, yada.</span>” He looked over a couple of paragraphs in more detail,
and sighed. “<span class="quote">Still, I suppose we should do something about it. This is
the third time in a month. It may call for drastic action.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Good lord, old boy,</span>” I said, and swallowed, “<span class="quote">you don't mean something
like...cutting back on the recreational schedule!?</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Of course not!</span>”, said X, a look of shocked outrage spreading across his
face. “<span class="quote">That would mean forfeits in either the tennis or the yacht racing,
and I'm certainly not going to give Stanford the pleasure!</span>” He thought
for a moment. “<span class="quote">The big problem here is the engineers. They just keep
writing more and more code that everyone wants to use. If we could
somehow slow them down... Perhaps we could ask JLG to chain the engineers
to their desks only twelve hours a day, instead of fourteen.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Nice idea, but it won't work,</span>” I said, “<span class="quote">most of them have never realized
we lock them to their workstations, in the first place.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Oh, you're right,</span>” he said, and then shrugged. “<span class="quote">Well, what're you going
to do? Let's not let it ruin the day. WAITER! Some more caviar and
truffles over here, please...</span>”
</p><p>
&lt;POOF!&gt;
</p><p>
Ah, the daydreams of a Be technical writer. Sadly, however much the
writing team at Be might deserve a scenario like the one above, reality
is somewhat different. Not all the retin-A in the world can disguise the
fact that the hard copy version of the Be Book is showing its age, and
that someone who wishes to write code for the BeOS must collect
information from many disparate sources in order to find out the real
capabilities of the system. Let's not beat around the bush, either, but
put the blame squarely where it lies—with the engineers, who in spite
of being chained to their workstations, keep pumping out more and more
clean, fast, useful code that needs to be documented before developers
can use it. Add to this the fact that the doc team is about one-tenth the
size of the engineering team, and that the kernel engineers have a
tendency to steal any tech writer who knows enough to be useful, and well
-- you get the idea.
</p><p>
The question then becomes, how to remedy this situation, so that the tech
writers can enjoy the life of leisure they so richly deserve, without
hindering the developers from getting on with developing?
</p><p>
Therein, Gentle Developer, lies the meat of this article. We're always
looking for ways to get information to you more quickly and with greater
accuracy. As the New Guy On the Block&amp;trade; in the documentation team,
I'm particularly looking for the best way that I can serve the
development community. Comments and suggestions in general are welcome
(please send any to ken@be.com). Also, I'd like to solicit your views on
two possibilities I'm thinking about.
</p><p>
When I first arrived at Be, lo these two months ago, one of the first
things I did was to write a tutorial on using the basic menu user
interface functions. Now, menus are simple things, and you're all
probably familiar with the functions to use and manipulate them. The idea
behind writing the tutorial wasn't to explain menus, but to test out an
idea that for most developers and most programs, the Be Book is overkill.
You don't really need all of that information if a short tutorial
presenting the commonly used functionality of the API is available. So,
take a look at
&lt;http://www.be.com/developers/developer_library/tutorials/menu_tutorial.pdf
&gt; (sorry, currently available only in .pdf format), and see if you think
you'd like to read more papers in a "tutorial series," similar to this
one but on different topics. Because these tutorial documents wouldn't be
as long as comprehensive reference documentation, we can write them (and
update them) more quickly than the chapters in the Be Book. A likely next
tutorial topic: Mouse Stuff, because certain important aspects of working
with the mouse are terribly out of date in the Be Book.
</p><p>
The other possibility I'd like to mention is automatic document
generation from C++ header files. Currently, header files are the
"documentation of last resort" for the desperate developer—if you
can't find what you need anywhere else, go look through the headers.
Unfortunately, certain aspects of headers, like indexing and formatting,
are not quite so perfect as they could be. Automatic document generation
from the headers can solve some of these problems, and can also turn code
comments into documentation paragraphs with just a bit more effort. To
test this, I've edited the already excellent comments in the new C++
Network Kit API, and run those headers through an automatic doc
generator. You can view the results
&lt;http://www.be.com/documentation/be_book/The%20Network%20Kit/
netapi_autogen/index.html&gt;. If you'd like to see us work toward making
the other APIs available this way (probably starting with the newest and
working backward) let me know, and be sure to rate the usefulness of this
compared to other documentation projects we could be doing.
</p><p>
Oh, and one more thing. If you could put "DOC FEEDBACK" as the subject
line in any responses to this article, it'd let me use those cool Be
attributes to easily organize my mail.

This isn't about time travel and a return to the time when an earlier
version of Windows Everywhere gave rise to such projects as Windows at
Work and Modular Windows. (For history buffs, the head of that project
was none other than Rob Glaser, now the CEO of Real Networks.) On second
thought, my topic today is related to time travel, but to the future, to
the After the Suit era. Specifically, I'll address some of the proposals
for "remedies," for ways to level the playing field dominated by
Microsoft.
</p><p>
I'll mention only briefly various structural remedies such as the "Baby
Bills"—slicing and dicing Microsoft. There's the vertical way --
breaking Microsoft up into several smaller, identical competing entities.
The horizontal way, on the other hand, attempts to separate slices of the
Microsoft mille-feuilles: hardware, OS, applications, Internet services,
and so on.
</p><p>
The horizontal overhaul gets very complicated in a hurry. Take one
example: How do you create four competing OS companies? Do you allocate
engineers, executives, and marketers, using an eenie, meenie, mynie, moe
algorithm? If you decide to auction off the source code to other
companies, what about the comments written on the wall of some forgotten
bathroom stall? Who decides who gets the people who know where the good
stuff is?

Different but no less interesting questions arise on closer evaluation of
vertical slicing. As discussed before, drawing an actionable line between
types of software is very difficult—perhaps intractable.
Misunderstandings arise because we treat software as a thing—which,
clearly, it isn't. Creating Baby Bells is relatively easy to conceive and
execute because geographical regions and local loops have a physical
reality that's easy to map into a corporate structure. Car radios have a
physical reality and a unit cost, software doesn't. As a result, similes
between the bundling of cars radios at the factory and the bundling of
software modules are misleading.
</p><p>
Software is information of a special kind. Information on a newspaper
page is inert. Software is "recombinant" information, it does something
by itself and in combination with other software. Such difficulties are
being recognized in Washington and, rather than attempt the mystifying
task of defining what is part of an operating system and what's not, some
sages are suggesting abandoning the pursuit altogether. Microsoft wants
to stay free to innovate, they say, so let them do that—but let's
dictate the conditions under which they do so.
</p><p>
Specifically, as Windows is extended, let's make sure it's done in a
clear, modularized, well-documented way. The idea is to give competitors
equal access to the system's plumbing and blueprints so they can write
functional equivalents. This refers us back to the "motives and methods"
issue discussed in an earlier newsletter
<a class="xref" href="Issue4-6.html#Gassee4-6" title="More Browser Integration Bedtime Stories">More Browser Integration Bedtime Stories</a>.
</p><p>
The tentacular method used by Microsoft in building a browser into
Windows is viewed by some as a device, a way to maintain and extend its
monopoly. The browser is difficult to remove—it is inextricably
intertwined in the OS. This results in a barrier to entry by a
competitor. Customers cannot remove the MS module and install the
functional equivalent, the better, faster—or fatter, slower—module,
thus letting the market work on a level playing field. Using the much
discussed browser integration as an example, under the sages' proposal,
Microsoft would create a browser in a "clean, well-lighted" way, making
it easy to see where and how it connected to the system, implementing it
as a well-delineated module. In that example, it would have been easy for
Netscape to write an equivalent module that customers could easily swap
for the MS implementation, lest we forget Netscape got there first.
</p><p>
Making Windows modular is a seductive proposal. It avoids the creation of
roach motels by leveling access to system facilities and technical
information and it does not prevent Microsoft from adding innovative
features to Windows, it just limits its ability to use recombinant
information as a way to maintain and extend its monopoly. But what will
critics and/or Microsoft allies say? They'll probably start by claiming
this type of disclosure is excessive, costly, slows them down, what about
trade secrets, intellectual property... Critics will also ask pricing
questions. A software module doesn't have much physical cost when added
on an existing CD-ROM, thus giving the incumbent the ability to give it
away and bleed its competition dry.
</p><p>
Others will introduce implementation issues, such as the need, real or
tactical, to take three years and three thousand people in a separate
building in order to disentangle and document Windows internals in
compliance with the court order—by which time Microsoft will be
Everywhere Else. The fact that there are pros and cons to this particular
avenue of remediation is actually good news. When a proposal is all pro
and no con—it's a con. There has been some debate of structural and
contractual remedies, the latter being the easiest to implement, I hope
we'll now hear a more detailed discussion of the modular approach.
