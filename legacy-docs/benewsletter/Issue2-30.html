This article continues the exploration of process synchronization in BeOS
device drivers. You may want to review the first article,
"Synchronization in Device Drivers," from three months ago.
</p><p>
That article concluded with an example of the "z" facility which
coordinates multiple "producers" and "consumers." This method yields a
"broadcast" form of synchronization, where each thread examines the
shared data, determining whether to proceed. As an exercise for readers,
I did not show the version which uses just one semaphore. One reader,
Oleg, deserves honorable mention for e-mailing the correct code.
</p><p>
My single-semaphore version follows. It assumes greater responsibility,
being able to both coordinate threads and to lock data structures. In the
previous article, locking was achieved through the <code class="function">lock()</code>/<code class="function">unlock()</code> calls.

A <span class="type">wchan</span> struct is allocated (statically) to protect a set of data,
around which multi-threaded activities occur. An example is driver data
for a serial port. N serial ports would require N <span class="type">wchan</span> structs.
</p><p>
The general idea is to acquire exclusive use of the data when you enter
the driver, and relinquish it when you leave; the relevant calls are
<code class="function">wacquire()</code> and <code class="function">wrelease()</code>. Within the driver, you may block for any
reason, by calling <code class="function">wsleep()</code>, whereupon you temporarily lose control of
the data. After unblocking, you automatically have control of the data,
but it may have changed while you were "asleep." How were you woken up?
By another thread in the driver, who called <code class="function">wacquire()</code> and then <code class="function">wakeup()</code>.
</p><p>
To simplify the discussion, this article is ignoring hardware interrupts
entirely. Therefore, all flows-of- control are assumed to be background
threads and, of course, in the kernel. As most hardware is operated with
interrupts, this code would need augmentation before such use. See the
previous article for details.
</p><p>
Here is the standard BeOS "control" entry-point for our hypothetical
driver. It demonstrates the use of the "wchan" facility. Since there are
no interrupts, all data producer and consumer threads must call this
function. <code class="constant">PUT_DATA</code> is a producer command, while <code class="constant">GET_LINE</code> and
<code class="constant">FLUSH_ON_NULL</code> are consumer commands.
<code class="constant">WAIT_FOR_MORE</code> and <code class="constant">WAIT_UNTIL_EMPTY</code>
consume nothing, but merely synchronize on some condition.

The purpose of the driver is to pass data between user-level threads.
Data is buffered with byte-wide FIFOs, using the <code class="function">putc()</code>
and <code class="function">getc()</code> calls.
As a convenience, these will block when there is no data to get, or too
much data already buffered. Note the call to <code class="function">wakeup()</code> whenever the FIFO
changes: This serves all threads in the driver, not just those sleeping
in the clist module.

Devising a more conservative protocol for <code class="function">wakeup()</code> calls in the <span class="type">clist</span>
module would greatly improve efficiency. A larger blocking factor for
<code class="function">malloc()</code> would also help!
</p><p>
The attentive reader might have noticed that <code class="function">wsleep()</code> is defined as
returning <code class="code">void</code>, but is used as if it returns <code class="code">bool.</code> This leads us to a
key topic: The failure to acquire semaphores.
</p><p>
The call <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> blocks until it succeeds; this is rarely the
desired behavior for device drivers. The user may wish to abort an
operation which is lagging or hung. Programs may want to timeout
automatically, and retry. This is all possible with the <code class="function">acquire_sem_etc()</code>
call. When a timeout occurs, or the thread is sent a signal, the call
returns without having acquired the semaphore. The driver must respond,
usually by returning an immediate error.
</p><p>
I must admit failure myself, in being unable to work this into the above
implementation of "wchan." Readers are welcome to respond.
</p><p>
Therefore, I must return to a BYOB (bring your own blockable) approach,
as in the first article. To recap, each thread that wants to block until
"something happens" will call <code class="function">wsleep()</code>. A semaphore is created on the
spot, and added atomically to the list of waiting threads. Later, a
different thread will call <code class="function">wakeup()</code>, with the usual broadcast effect. The
return from <code class="function">wsleep()</code> is <code class="constant">TRUE</code>.
</p><p>
However, the return may be <code class="constant">FALSE</code>. In this case, a signal is pending. This
could have arrived during the <code class="function">wsleep()</code>, or some time before. When using
<code class="function">acquire_sem_etc()</code>, the BeOS will not allow a thread to block, or remain
blocked, with a pending signal. For the good of the driver, the error
must be propagated from <code class="function">wsleep()</code>, and then out of the driver. All this
occurs in the following code:

synchronization, which should help writers of BeOS device drivers. There
are multiple ways to coordinate threads, and to prevent corruption of
data structures. The approach that a driver writer adopts will depend on
the service being exported, and the particulars of the hardware.

I wanted to give you all a synopsis of our European developer's
conferences, which were held several weeks ago, and respond to some of
our European developers' comments. Without further ado...
</p><p>
There were two sites for the conferences, one in London and one in
Frankfurt. The London conference was held at Planet Hollywood and was
attended by about 40 developers. There was a small theater in the back of
the building operated by a nice old guy named Reg. Reg's first comment
was "Hey, I'll try to help, but I don't know anything about computers." I
showed him the OS and the VideoMania demo, and he was literally walking
about telling his co-workers "we need to get one of those boxes!" (It's
nice to know there's still some unconquered minds out there!) Time seemed
short in London, and Christophe had to drag me out of the building at the
end.
</p><p>
Computer Warehouse, a distributor of Macintosh clones, was there
demonstrating a Tanzania-based clone in a dusty blue case called...the BE
MACHINE! We had some problems with the keyboards, but once we cleared
these up things went fine.
</p><p>
The Frankfurt conference was held in a community center and was attended
by about 60 developers. We had more time, and when the presentations were
over, people began pulling out their Zip drives and doing some coding,
trading ideas and files. PIOS, a German clone maker, was there displaying
a machine that will eventually be able to boot 6 different operating
systems, including the BeOS.
</p><p>
The European developers in attendance were, on average, younger than
their US counterparts. While optimistic, many were concerned about Be's
direction. Many commented on things like the BeBox, GeekPort and database
features of the original BeOS. They didn't so much think these were the
most important features overall for the BeOS, but they definitely felt
they were distinctive, and led them to investigate Be in the first place.
</p><p>
The European developers seemed extremely technically- oriented, even as
compared to their US counterparts. They have very technical schooling and
really know the BeOS. However, they didn't seem as concerned with making
money from their efforts as the US developers. One of the best things
that came out of the conference is that I think many of the developers
left with the realization that they could commercialize their products
with some effort and some help from Be Europe. To the European
developers: You have an incredible resource in the Paris office! They
have a huge amount of experience and they want to help you commercialize
your products. Please, contact them and let them help you.
</p><p>
Speaking of contacting, many of the developers had questions and comments
at the conference. Most of your comments I have already made known here
at Be, and I have answers for many of your questions which I will begin
emailing back to you this week. If you don't get a response before Boston
MacWorld, send me a message at geoff@be.com.
</p><p>
The business stuff aside, the mood and small sizes of the conferences
made for two great parties. England and Germany, both known for good
beer! I'd like to thank all of you who were there for making my trip so
enjoyable, and I hope to see you all again soon!

One of the measures of excellence that most software engineers are proud
of utilizing is the "I stayed up this late" factor. Dude, I stayed up
'til 5am to get this nifty feature working!! I did that last night, and I
proudly showed the fruits of my labors to my wife in the morning to which
she responded, "Well, that's not very practical is it?" She was
absolutely right, the feature I had implemented wasn't very practical,
but it has sales appeal! You want a little sizzle with that steak?
</p><p>
Man, you wouldn't believe how many Master's Awards entries we've seen in
the last hours approaching the entry deadline. Now, I've been on the
vanguard of a few emerging platforms in my day, and they objections come
in waves. Something new... It will never work... Oh that thing, there's
no software for it... It doesn't run Windows apps...
</p><p>
The words are all too familiar, and all too often we in the herd blindly
follow the beat of the Master drum without looking very closely at the
veracity of the statements. Well, in my humble opinion, the BeOS is
quickly approaching that critical mass point. We survive long enough,
interesting software shows up, a cottage industry is born. I'm telling
you, this software is hot! And new stuff is coming all the time.
</p><p>
We've got music, lights, sounds, movies, spreadsheets, mail, paint, word
processing. If you ask me, I think we're beginning to look lively.
</p><p>
But let's not stop here. The BeDC is coming right quick, and if you're
going you'll likely be able to see all this nifty stuff. We'll have a
impromptu 3D contest, we're giving out machines, we're giving out disks,
there will be dancing, singing, food, entertainment, and the Macintosh
faithful. But before you go, have you ever considered how many infrared
output devices exist in your world? I took a quick look around the office
and found a keyboard, mouse, several TV and VCR controllers, and even a
couple of PDA devices that do IRDA transfers.
</p><p>
The funny thing about infrared is that you get to sit further away from
the device you are controlling. Say, in the comfort of your living room
chair, or on your bed, or what have you. It's pretty easy to train an
infrared receiver to recognize when signals are coming from a particular
device. So here's some more info on that prototype board that we're using
to do IR.
</p><p>
Insight Electronics<br />
1-800-677-7716<br />
Part: CDB8130<br />
$200 (for two boards)<br />
http://www.crystal.com/
</p><p>
This is one of those times when I say, just go out and buy this thing.
What kind of a geek are you anyway? It's loads of fun, and when you
figure out that you can go buy one of those infrared keyboards for about
$80, you'll have no end of fun as to the evil you could do with it.
</p><p>
So, to recount, we have lots of software, lots of nifty video thingies,
lots of MIDI thingies, bunches of game-type thingies, accelerated 3D
graphics. It's beginning to smell like soup. I think when our many
thousands of magazine readers get their disks, they will be eager to buy
software to play on their new toy. This is where we want to be. So before
you head for Boston, do just one more compile knowing that there will be
thousands of end-users who will be interested in your wares real soon now.

Almost every day, we get mail from people interested in investing in Be.
This is very flattering, we very much appreciate the sentiment it
reveals, but law and common sense—they sometimes agree—dictate we
decline.
</p><p>
I can understand the interest: In the seventies, one of my colleagues at
Hewlett-Packard and Data General, Bill Foster, started a company called
Stratus; they made a non-stop computer system, roughly going after the
same market as Tandem, a phenomenal success at the time. On the occasion
of one of my trips to the East Coast, I called on Bill Foster and offered
to put my savings in his company. He smiled, thanked me and declined very
politely.
</p><p>
I was very disappointed and, for a while, considered buying a McDonald's
franchise in Paris. Fortunately, your opinion may vary, that didn't
happen either and I decided I still loved computers after all. A decade
and a half later, I finally invested in a start-up, Be Inc., and I now
have a much better perspective on the wisdom of US securities laws and
the reasons for the barriers they erect between professional investors
and the rest of us.
</p><p>
Investing early in a high-tech start-up looks enormously attractive.
Compute the returns. Today, how much is $1,000 invested in the early
Microsoft worth? Or Apple, or Intel, or SGI, or Oracle—the list is
wonderfully long and interesting. It attests to the greatest, fastest,
legal creation of wealth in the history of mankind around Sand Hill Road
in Menlo Park, CA. That road is also known as VC Gulch for its high
concentration of venture capital firms. How could one not want to get in
at the ground floor and enjoy the ride?
</p><p>
Well, there are the crashes. The roadsides of VC Gulch are littered with
the carcasses of failed start-ups. Early stage high-tech companies are
not good places to park college education or retirement money.
</p><p>
Hardier individuals will object they know the risks and are willing to
invest anyway: They're able and willing to put discretionary funds in
play without endangering their or their family's future. In some very
limited cases, the law allows individual investors to play in the same
field as the pros. The restrictions are severe and involve, among other
parameters, high requirements for the individual's net worth and
education—and lots of paperwork. See your friendly securities attorney
for details.
</p><p>
There is more. Early stage companies have ambitious plans, they aim high.
But software or ASICs take time, the rendez-vous in orbit with some other
technology may or may not happen. For a number of reasons, the company
you've invested in needs more time, more money. At this stage,
professional investors make a decision: They put more money in the
company, or they don't.
</p><p>
If they do, or if new investors come in, they evaluate the "updated"
opportunity offered by the company in a number of ways. If some pros
decide not to put in more money, it means they see a higher risk and/or a
lower reward than they like. As a consequence, the company has to offer
better terms in order to make itself at least as attractive as other
deals the pros could invest in. Practically, the share of the company
owned by the earlier round investors shrinks to a smaller percentage,
sometimes a much smaller one. This is still preferable to closing the
business, so shareholders (including the founding employees) acquiesce.
They see a potential in the business, they need money to actualize said
potential, and they're willing to pay the price in reducing their
percentage holding.
</p><p>
The dilution is sometimes severe enough to be called "washing out." This
is not a problem for investors who stay with the play and put money in
the new round. They usually conserve their percentage of the company or
pretty close to it, depending upon complex sets of terms in their initial
investment. New investors also try to treat employees well by issuing new
options, they need their commitment.
</p><p>
So, assuming the company ultimately makes it, the only parties who really
suffer in this process are the investors who don't play in the new round.
If they are pros, washing out and being washed out is part of their
everyday life. No hard feelings. They made a judgement call.
</p><p>
For the "small," non-professional investor, re-investing may or may not
be possible; being washed out might be perceived as an unfair experience,
cautionary paperwork or not. That's where securities law and common sense
agree in preventing normal people from playing with, or against, the
pros. Who wants to bet money and play pick-up basketball against Michael
Jordan or Dennis Rodman? And, no, I have no VC names in mind as I write
this.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="BeDevTalk2-30"></a>BeDevTalk Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>
BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.
</p><p>
To subscribe to BeDevTalk, visit the mailing list page on our web site:

</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id577877"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id577883"></a>Subject: Think of all the fun...</h4></div></div></div><p>
An initial public interest suggestion—that all Be developers should
buy the full-blown issue of the Preview Release rather than wait to get
it for free—generated a lot of mail (and no objections). War stories
were swapped ("...they all laughed when I sat down to my BeBox..."),
and opinions on the blinking green lights exchanged (everybody seems to
like them; one listener suggested that a BeBox-bezel clone to snap onto
the front of the StarMax machine would be a great Christmas present).
</p><p>
Ingmar Krusch fairly assessed the co-worker critic situation:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">When someone laughs at my box, I turn the power off, back on, boot in
15 seconds, switch to 32 Bit resolution, open up 6 [QuickTime] movies
and ask if their Pentium can do equal... [Of course] If they're not
blown away by this and ask for real world applications, you should
start improvising.</span>”
</p><p>
The thread was not without its nay-sayers. Jonathan Perret (a
"believer" nonetheless, he assures us), answered Mr. Krusch's question:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">You got a Millennium? As soon as I switch to 32-bit, all the redraws
get very slow and ugly... Then I launch 6 QuickTime movies, the hard
drive seeks like mad and renders the system nearly unusable—besides
the fact that the movies are no longer at 25 fps. And besides, it's not
*that* impressive. NT does it fine, in case you didn't know.</span>”
</p><p>
After the expected rebuttal, the thread opened a can of Pentium vs.
PPC. Sit back, this one will probably be with us for awhile.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id577936"></a>Subject: suspend_thread(), resume_thread(), and recv()</h4></div></div></div><p>
An initial question about unblocking a semaphore-blocked thread turned
into a wider discussion of signals after one of our readers suggested
using <code class="function">send_signal()</code> instead of <code class="function">suspend_thread()</code>. Are signals evil,
non-portable, and old-fashioned? Or are they the only way to design a
modern multi-tasking kernel? Also, is there a difference between
"thread safe" and "signal safe"?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Contrary to a notion developed in this thread,
<code class="function">suspend_thread()</code> *does* work on a semaphore-blocked thread (the thread
is immediately unblocked and suspended, as described in the Be Book).
</p><p>
However, there *is* a bug on the resume side—if the <code class="function">suspend_thread()</code>
and <code class="function">resume_thread()</code> calls are too close to each other, the resume is
ignored.
</p><p>
For now, stick a greater-than-3ms snooze between the calls (this is
demonstrated in the Be Book in the <code class="function">snooze()</code> description, but the snooze
value is a bit on the low side.)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id577995"></a>Subject: PR tidbits</h4></div></div></div><p>
As folks received their Preview Release CDs, they pointed out some of
the rough edges, disagreed with some of the interface decisions, and
made some suggestions (quoting from a variety of unnamed sources):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Kaleidoscope: "When you resize the window to be tall enough, a
slice at the bottom doesn't refresh properly."
</p></li><li><p>
"Be seems to be measuring double-click intervals from mouse-down
to mouse-down, rather than (IMHO correctly) mouse-up to mouse-down."
</p></li><li><p>
"If you want the movies to play REALLY fast, here's a secret tip:
Push down the Caps Lock key before starting them. " (from Jake Hamby
of Be)
</p></li><li><p>
NetPositive: "Open it up, resize it only horizontally and see the
dirty trail the Location TextControl leaves behind."
</p></li><li><p>
Tracker: "If you click on a file/folder name to edit it, the
cursor stays in the I-beam "edit text" shape until you do it again."
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id578047"></a>Subject: Multiple Undo/Redo</h4></div></div></div><p>
How do you treat an action that occurs "in the middle" of a series of
undo/redo's? Should it be added to the end of the list, or inserted at
the current position? Is it possible to store the action state as a
tree (for undo, yes, but redo would be ambiguous).
</p><p>
Also, it was suggested that Be needs a standard undo/redo key mapping.
How about Alt-z/Alt-Z? Should this be user or app-settable? And where
are those user interface guidelines?
</p><p>
This led to a discussion of the "F&lt;n&gt;" keys—should they be used more
often? As an example, Jon Ragnarsson suggested using an F&lt;n&gt; key to
show/hide Replicators.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id578076"></a>Subject: B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT in DR9?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Sander Stoks wrote in to ask about the transparent 32 bit bug—is it
fixed in PR?
</p><p>
The thread then became a discussion of how to manage windows that
contain lots of views: Should you really have to "roll your own" views
(by creating and managing rectangles yourself) in order to avoid the
efficiency hit of multiple views? It was suggested that while it may be
lamentable that BViews tend to become very slow when you throw a few
dozen into a single window, this is simply the way of the Be world...
</p><p>
Jon Watte:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The only alternative I can see is moving lots of stuff from the
app_server into libbe.so, and have the app_server ONLY talk to
BWindows, letting BViews be handled entirely on the client side. That
would reduce communication, but would probably have other problems,
since that's not the solution they chose.</span>”
</p><p>
Marco Nelissen:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">You could do it the other way around... Ideally, you should be able to
add your own modules to the app_server, which would then perform
layout, drawing, or whatever else needs to be done fast.</span>”
</p><p>
Dianne Hackborn:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...there's no reason to put layout managers in the app_server: Since
they typically don't interact with the user, they don't really need the
capabilities of a <code class="classname">BView</code>; about the only app_server-related functions
they need to work with are <code class="methodname">Draw()</code>, <code class="methodname">FrameResized()</code>, etc., and those all
can be handled outside of transactions with the server, with little
trouble.</span>”
</p><p>
So—why isn't the <code class="classname">BView</code> class faster? Where does the time go? Dianne
Hackborn suggested that it's sunk by the amount of data that flows
between the client and the server. Jon Watte says the amount of data
doesn't matter—it's the communication overhead that's consumptive.
So should multiple manipulations be bracketed by calls to <code class="classname">BWindow</code>'s
<code class="methodname">DisableUpdates()</code> and <code class="methodname">ReenableUpdates()</code>
(in order to batch the commands)?
</p><p>
Mr. Stoks' question never did get answered.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The 32-bit transparency bug has been fixed (in PR).
