Now that the Release 3.1 CDs for both Intel and PowerPC have been sent
off to the duplicator, it's time to put together the downloadable update
to Release 3. A question immediately arises: What's changed between the
releases?
</p><p>
Rather than try to figure it out from the change logs, it's much more fun
to write scripts and programs to do the work. The ultimate proof is in
the bits on the CD.
</p><p>
The strategy we'll use is this:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Get both the R3 and R3.1 CDs
</p></li><li><p>
Generate a list of files on each CD
</p></li><li><p>
Figure out what files are unique to each CD
</p></li><li><p>
Compare all common files
</p></li></ul><p>
Getting the CDs is easy—I work here!
</p><p>
Generating the list of files on the R3 and R3.1 CDs is a bit more
challenging. The shell commands do not provide an easy way to just make a
list of all the files with full path names. This short shell script can
do the job, however:
</p><pre class="programlisting sh">
#!/bin/sh
#
#  vnames [path]
#
#  lists all files in path (or cwd) with all directory
#  components
#

trap "exit 2" 2   # interrupts cause us to exit quickly

#
# check arguments
#

if [ $# -gt 1 ]
then
  echo wrong number of arguments\(${#}\) to $0
  echo usage: $0 [ path ]
  exit 1
else
  if [ $# -eq 1 ]
  then
    dir=$1
  else
    dir=.
  fi
fi

if [ "`ls "$dir"`" = "" ]  # empty directory?
then
  echo "$dir"
else
  for file in "$dir"/*
  do
    if [ -L "$file" -o ! -d "$file" ]  # link, or file?
    then
      echo "$file"
    else                # it's a directory
      "$0" "$file"
    fi
  done
fi
exit 0
</pre><p>
This script recurses down the directory hierarchy, frantically outputting
filenames along the way. The only really tricky part is dealing with an
empty directory, which will cause a filename expansion like "$dir/*" to
evaluate to whatever is in $dir with a literal '/*' at the end. There may
be a better way to do this, but none of the Unix wizards were around when
I wrote this script.
</p><p>
To generate the list of files, I used the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd '/BeOS Intel R3'; vnames | sort &gt; ~/names_r3
</pre><p>
This creates a sorted list of names of all the files on the R3 CD, and
puts it in a file names_r3 in my home directory. For the R3.1 CD, use
this command:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd '/BeOS Intel R3.1'; vnames | sort &gt; ~/names_r3.1
</pre><p>
Sorting these lists is important for the next step. There's a handy
command line tool, 'comm', which when given two files can identify the
unique and common lines in each one. We use this to generate some more
lists:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd
$ comm -2 -3 names_r3 names_r3.1 &gt; unique_r3
$ comm -1 -3 names_r3 names_r3.1 &gt; unique_r3.1
</pre><p>
The unique_r3 list is not too interesting—it tells us what cruft will
be left around when we download any update. Examining this list revealed
that no harm would be done by leaving these files around.
</p><p>
The unique_r3.1 list is much more useful. It tells us some of the files
from the R3.1 CD to put in the update. Not included in this list are the
files that have the same name in both releases, but whose content has
changed. Figuring out which files with the same names have changed is the
most challenging part of this task.
</p><p>
For text files and other non-executable files, a simple binary compare
using the 'cmp' tool is sufficient. Executable files are harder—we put
a version string into the binary, and the version changed for 3.1. The
actual code and data, however did not change in most cases, so there is
no point including the file in an update.
</p><p>
I put together executable compare tools for both the PE object file
format used on x86 (pecomp) and the PEF format use on PowerPC (pefcomp).
These tools compare only the important parts of the executables, ignoring
things like version strings. In PEF, one has to ignore even more, as
there are hints about where to find things in libraries, and if the size
of the library changes, the hint changes. Given that our libraries DID
change, but in most cases the apps did not, pefcomp must ignore the hint
differences.
</p><p>
The script that follows recurses through the directory tree and compares
things. It might have been easier to generate a list of common files
between the two releases, iterate over the list, and pass just filenames
to a simpler version of this script. However, luck would have it that
this script was written first. Hindsight is always closer to 20/20...

We use this script as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ vcompare '/BeOS Intel R3' '/BeOS Intel R3.1' &gt; ~/diffs_3_3.1
</pre><p>
Running this script generates a list of the common files between the
releases that differ. Once we have this list, we combine it with the list
of unique files for R3.1. Presto! We have a list of files that need to go
into the update package.

Ahhh, a breath of fresh air does wonders for the thought processes (along
with an hour of skating in the empty parking lot at 3 am). Anyhow, it's
way past time for sleep. The energy to continue comes in waves. For an
hour, or half an hour, broken up by moments of complete ineptitude.
</p><p>
It's the programmer's high, and to go there, you need a deadline (not
necessarily for the problem you're working on—a Newsletter deadline
works too), a problem that you can't figure out, a splash of water in the
face once an hour, and a couple bucks worth of quarters for the Coke
machine.
</p><p>
Eat dinner pretty late so you don't get hungry—around 8:30pm works for
me. It's fun to walk around the office after you eat, while the food-coma
passes, and see who else is there at 9pm. There are usually at least 3 or
4 other junkies who just can't get enough of the CRT glow. They all have
their favorite distractions for moments of coding catatonia.
</p><p>
Several engineers, myself included, have instruments in our cubes. Some
have computers from their formative years to fool with, and others have
juggling blocks, doh! It's funny how well the stereotypes fit sometimes.
</p><p>
There are also a bunch of people you won't find at work late. They go
home to a different place, another machine to play with. You'd be amazed
how much more work gets done compared to during the day, despite the
moments of aphasia, and the bugs that get entered then.
</p><p>
I have a small apartment and it's tough to resist my wife saying "Come
on, everybody's doing it. Sleep won't hurt you. You'll be cool if you
do." But I'm not like the other kids. Dark outside doesn't mean it's bed
time, it means I don't have to wear sunglasses any more. So I stay at Be
to do it. But enough about me.
</p><p>
What about you? Are you staying up late to put that extra edge into your
code? Do you have some nagging problems eating into your sleepy time?
</p><p>
Well, we're here to help. Developer support is growing. We're four strong
as of this week with the addition of Owen Smith, our new Interface Kit
expert to be. And now someone's in charge of the scurvy lot of us --
Hippo's been promoted to DTS manager. Look out, he's crackin' the whip.
</p><p>
That's right, we're specializing, specialized even. There's a new web
form you can use to ask us questions—developers only need apply. The
form is just a small piece of a larger project to amass a great deal of
knowledge into the size of four little cubes of activity.
</p><p>
The new database we're working on lets us follow a thread from message to
message. Unless you've done support before, you wouldn't believe how hard
it can be to remember what someone is talking about when they don't
include the entire original message in the reply. Now, it's taken care of
for you. Just be sure not to muck with the subject of your replies to us,
and we'll know just who you are, and what you're up to.
</p><p>
We are now also categorizing the questions, for a couple of reasons.
First, your questions can be assigned to a DTS engineer who specializes
in the area of the BeOS that you are asking about. Also, it means that we
are building a knowledge base, for training new DevSupport engineers, and
finding the answers to questions that we know have been asked before, but
don't quite remember.
</p><p>
Oooo, it makes me tingle to think of it. We have coherent threads of
interaction categorized in a searchable database. Wait a minute, if we
can do all this through a web browser, why couldn't a developer do the
same!?
</p><p>
Stop right there. No, we haven't implemented it yet. But just imagine it.
No, it takes more time. Time I haven't got. I'm staying up all night
writing drivers for digital audio I/O cards. But the plans are being
laid. We're developing the knowledge base for such a system now, in the
DevSupport database.
</p><p>
So if you've got a problem, bring it up, fill it out, and send it on in.
You're helping the effort to build a bank of knowledge for you and for
BeOS developers everywhere. Someday it will be searchable. And we will
all be one—I mean up at 1:00am, or 2:00am, or..., writing software for
BeOS.
</p><p>
If you need more information, don't hesitate to ask!

PC Expo is not Comdex. You know that because the cab drivers don't
complain about the geeks' lack of sophistication—about people who stay
in their rooms at night checking their e-mail instead of partying like
the real men at the golf equipment convention last week. The schmoozing
at PC Expo is just as good as at Comdex, and the food is much better than
the fiber-free calories you get in Las Vegas, required for long stays at
the gambling tables.
</p><p>
So far, we've done well. John Markoff from the NY Times passed on an
invitation from John Dvorak to a get together at the Empire Tap Room on
West 18th. This was an event designed to mix industry executives and
writers for "informal" conversations, on the assumption—accurate I
think—that these conversations have more content than press releases
and conferences.
</p><p>
Strangely enough, the formula results more in industry people pitching
each other than bending the ears of reporters present—something to do,
perhaps, with the potential for money teleportation. Meanwhile, the
writers watch the ballet, and the dancers watch the watchers wondering
what rumors they'll start.
</p><p>
For my part, all I can say at this time is that the food, hearty Central
Europe fare, was great, and came with world-class beer. And while
enjoying Nikon's hospitality in hosting the party, John Dvorak and Alex
Osadzinski were taking each other's picture taking each other's picture
using identical Kodak digital cameras, making it a truly ecumenical event.
</p><p>
PC Expo opened this morning to a very substantial first day crowd. We'll
have a more complete account of our first participation in this show next
week, including audience reactions to the new BeOS applications and their
role in fulfilling the promise of the Media OS.
</p><p>
Taking a first quick tour, a few perceptions pierced the fog of jet lag
and caffeine deprivation. For instance, it is becoming retrospectively
obvious that Compaq intends to become the next IBM. This carries with it
a number of implications, most of them related to Compaq's control of its
destiny.
</p><p>
Compaq prospered by building and marketing computing solutions based on
Intel and Microsoft technologies. But, as these two companies have become
arguably more powerful than Compaq, they exert a great deal of influence
on it. Whether Compaq will assert more control over the definition of
current or future computing platforms, and how, is anybody's guess, but
the question is in the air.
</p><p>
Of course, skeptics describe doomsday scenarios, where the difficulties
in merging Digital into Compaq, right after absorbing Tandem, will bring
an end to these ambitions. In any case, we might be in for some
interesting moments as spectators to sumo-à-trois between Intel, Compaq,
and Microsoft.
</p><p>
Speaking of the latter giant, the spin on Windows 98 is noticeably
dignified. At a PC Expo, 8 days—not months or years—before retail
availability, you'd expect to see some kind of "Win 98 everywhere" theme.
Instead, it is conspicuously absent or down played on major Wintel OEM
booths; NT 5 and CE get more air time.

Lastly, I had a good time watching Kiki Stockhammer. For the relative
newcomers to this segment of the industry, Kiki is not what other
politically incorrect individuals insensitively call a "booth babe," one
of these females routinely sawed in two by a magician in the employ of a
company running out of marketing gimmicks.

No, Kiki unwittingly made a small contribution to the creation of this
company. I first saw her many years ago, I won't say how many, when she
demonstrated the Video Toaster, from a company called Newtek, running on
an Amiga at a MacWorld Expo. One thought led to another and, a few
episodes later, we show up at PC Expo.

In the mean time, the Video Toaster has gone through its own
karmictransformations. There is a new company called Play and a new
hardware product called Trinity, a third or fourth generation Video
Toaster. And there is Kiki, who, having long achieved icon status among
the cognoscenti, is more than ever the demo goddess, blazing the video
editing trail for her followers.

How long (oh Lord) must the mouse hesitate before a pop-up appears?
Opinions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Not immediately (a la Apple Help Balloons).
</p></li><li><p>
Tie it to the <span class="type">double</span>-click delay.
</p></li><li><p>
No, please, not that fast. Make it a separate setting
</p></li></ul><p>
So, then, “<span class="quote">should we complicate the interface by having a configurable
delay time for everything that could conceivably have a delay?</span>” asked
Tyler Riti rhetorically. After further testimony, pop-up delay ==
<span class="type">double</span>-click delay gained favor (with the rider that a right-mouse click
doesn't need a delay).
</p><p>
Sander Stoks thinks even faster with his gizmos:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If the user clicks and starts moving the mouse (more than a few pixels),
even within the <span class="type">double</span> click time, I assume that he wants to select a
menu item and I pop up the menu. This works quite nicely for me.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id707064"></a>Subject: Any use for _aliases_?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should Be introduce heat-seeking links that work more or less as do
Macintosh aliases? Ernest S. Tomlinson finds POSIX symbolic links too
"breakable." Eric Berdahl pointed out that you can simulate alias
behaviour in your own "Alias" object by caching the inode (node_ref) and
path.
</p><p>
After some thinking, Mr. Tomlinson realized that Mac aliases are one part
evil for each part good:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...perhaps aliases aren't such useful things after all...too many
aliases and all their usefulness disappears; navigating a bunch of
hierarchical menus stuffed with dozens of items isn't exactly fun. I wish
there were some better way to access any given file or application on my
computer, without resort to such clumsy expedients as sprinkling the
desktop with aliases.</span>”
</p><p>
THE BE LINE (from Dominic Giampaolo):
<span class="type">entry_ref</span>s and <span class="type">node_ref</span>s provide most of the functionality of Mac aliases
but I really want to *STRONGLY* discourage anyone from storing these on
disk. It's ok to use them if they're passed to your app in a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> but
if you store them on disk and then someone moves that file to another
volume, the <span class="type">entry</span>/<span class="type">node_ref</span> is no longer valid.
</p><p>
The BeOS does not have Mac aliases because they are not supportable in a
networked environment that uses
<acronym class="acronym" title="Network Filing System">NFS</acronym> or
<acronym class="acronym" title="Common Internet File System">CIFS</acronym> (and we were trying to think
ahead a little bit). Much argument has been made over that decision but
we're sticking to it.

Chris Tate recalls hearing that the scheduler quantum is 3 msecs. Has it
changed lately? Should the quantum be adjusted to the speed of the CPU?
Is Be planning to reassess the quantum?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE (paraphrasing Cyril
Meurillon, keeper of the quantum):
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The schedular quantum is, indeed, 3 milliseconds. However, in some
circumstances (blocking threads, primarily) the schedular will be invoked
before the 3 milliseconds is up. Relatedly, the <code class="function">snooze()</code> granularity is 1
millisecond. Both quanta (schedular and <code class="function">snooze()</code>) are constantly
scrutinized by the kernel team. The <code class="function">snooze()</code> granularity will almost
certainly change in Release 4.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id707190"></a>Subject: How does ioctl work</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Persistent driver data</h5></div></div></div><p>
When you pass data in an ioctl() call, should you encode the size of the
data (in the opcode or in the data itself), or should you pass the size
as an extra argument?
</p><p>
Dmitriy Budko:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...you can pass the size of the structure in the structure itself, but
PLEASE pass <code class="code">sizeof([the struct])</code> to ioctl too.</span>”
</p><p>
Speaking of device drivers, Jens Kilian wants to know if there's an easy
way to cache (user settable) data so it can be used by more than one
device invocation. Trey Boudreau suggests...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Create an area in one of your <code class="function">init_*</code> entry points (I do it in
<code class="function">init_hardware()</code>, but you can do it in
<code class="function">init_driver()</code> if you like). Name
the area something convenient, and do a <code class="function">find_area()</code> to locate it.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id707256"></a>Subject: How to send an array with BMessage? [To a remote application]</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Another Solution</h5></div></div></div><p>
How do you add an array to a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>? Michael Crawford suggests that if
the number of elements is small enough, you should simply add each
element individually (through <code class="methodname">AddInt32()</code> or whatever), and let the
receiver retrieve the elements by index (<code class="methodname">FindInt32(..., n, ...)</code>. If the
array is large (Mr. Crawford continues) you may want to add the data
through <code class="methodname">AddData()</code> and let the receiver reconstitute the array (through
clever pointer'ing). Stephen van Egmond pointed out that because
<code class="methodname">AddData()</code> deals with raw bytes, the sender and receiver either have to be
on the same type of platform, or else they have to haggle over data sex
and alignment. Jon Watte concedes that negotiation is necessary, but
that's the way of the world:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">So, <code class="classname">BMessage</code> data is like any other data that can travel between
machines: it's like a file format. If you design it well with advance
knowledge of the issues, reading/writing it is relatively easy. If you
don't, it isn't...</span>”
</p><p>
Ironically, Mr. Crawford's other non-serious suggestion—put the data
in a shared area—was later offered—seriously—by other listeners.
Using a shared area is fine if both the sender and receiver are on the
same (exact) machine.
