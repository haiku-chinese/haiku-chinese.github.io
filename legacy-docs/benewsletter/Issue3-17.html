In my last article, http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue104.html,
I presented you with three unrelated tips. I have three more tips, this
time, all pertaining to <code class="classname">BTextView</code>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id685813"></a>Tip 1</h3></div></div></div><p>
A number of people have asked how to get <code class="classname">BTextView</code> to reflow its text
dynamically when resized (take a look at <span class="application">BeMail</span> or
<span class="application">Expander</span> for an
example). Although there is no way to tell <code class="classname">BTextView</code> to do this for you
automatically, it's easy to implement this feature in your own TextView-
derived class.
</p><p>
The basic idea is to resize the <code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s "text rect" whenever the
window's frame is resized. The text rect is <code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s own coordinate
system in which it draws its text. <code class="classname">BTextView</code> wraps its text according to
the width of the text rect. (The text rect's height is dynamic—it is
always in sync with the total height of the text.) So, to reflow the text
whenever the view is resized, implement your own
<code class="methodname">FrameResized()</code> method:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">MyTextView</code>::<code class="methodname">FrameResized</code>(
  <span class="type">float</span> <code class="parameter">width</code>,
  <span class="type">float</span> <code class="parameter">height</code>)
{
  <code class="classname">BTextView</code>::<code class="methodname">FrameResized</code>(<code class="parameter">width</code>, <code class="parameter">height</code>);

  if (<code class="methodname">DoesWordWrap</code>()) {
    <span class="comment">// this gets the new bounds of the view</span>
    <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">textRect</code> = <code class="methodname">Bounds</code>();

    <span class="comment">// make sure we are in the view's coordinate system</span>
    <code class="varname">textRect</code>.<code class="methodname">OffsetTo</code>(<code class="constant">B_ORIGIN</code>);

    <span class="comment">// inset the text rect by 3 pixels so that the text doesn't</span>
    <span class="comment">// touch the frame of the view: this is the text rect</span>
    <code class="varname">textRect</code>.<code class="methodname">InsetBy</code>(3.0, 3.0);

    <span class="comment">// tell TextView to reflow itself</span>
    <code class="methodname">SetTextRect</code>(<code class="varname">textRect</code>);
  }
}
</pre><p>
In order for this to work properly, make sure your <code class="classname">BTextView</code> class has the
<code class="constant">B_FRAME_EVENTS</code> view flag set; otherwise, it will not be continuously
notified of frame resize events.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id686002"></a>Tip 2</h3></div></div></div><p>
An easy way to spruce up your editor is to support some sort of syntax
styling feature. For example, <span class="application">BeMail</span> displays
<acronym class="acronym" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s embedded in e-mail
messages in blue, and everything else is in black. It's simple to
implement this feature using <code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s
<span class="type">text_run_array</span> structure.
<code class="classname">BTextView</code> delimits its style runs using a structure called
<span class="type">text_run</span>. A <span class="type">text_run</span> associates a specific offset within the
<code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s text buffer with a <code class="classname">BFont</code>
and a <span class="type">rgb_color</span>. So, a
<span class="type">text_run</span> like this
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">text_run</span> <code class="varname">theRun</code>;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">offset</code> = 10;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">font</code> = <code class="varname">be_fixed_font</code>;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">color</code>.<code class="varname">red</code> = 255;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">color</code>.<code class="varname">green</code> = 0;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">color</code>.<code class="varname">blue</code> = 0;
<code class="varname">theRun</code>.<code class="varname">color</code>.<code class="varname">alpha</code> = 255;
</pre><p>
would tell <code class="classname">BTextView</code> that, starting at offset 10, it should start
displaying its text in red <code class="varname">be_fixed_font</code>.
</p><p>
A <span class="type">text_run_array</span> is simply a variable-length array of <span class="type">text_run</span>s. So, to
continue with our <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym> example, every <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>
will have two <span class="type">text_run</span>s
delimiting it, one at the start of the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym> to start a blue run, and one
at the end of the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym> to restore the text to black.
</p><p>
Assuming that the e-mail message has been parsed and you have the offsets
of the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>s, you could use something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// allocate some room for the text_run_array</span>
<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">number_of_runs</code> = <code class="varname">number_of_urls</code> * 2;
<span class="type">text_run_array *</span><code class="varname">theTRA</code> = (<span class="type">text_run_array *</span>)<code class="function">malloc</code>(<code class="function">sizeof</code>(<span class="type">text_run_array</span>) +
 (<code class="function">sizeof</code>(<span class="type">int32</span>) * (<code class="varname">number_of_runs</code> - 1)));

<span class="comment">// fill in the individual text_runs</span>
<code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">count</code> = <code class="varname">number_of_runs</code>;
for (<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">count</code>; <code class="varname">i</code> += 2) {
  <span class="comment">// start the URL run</span>
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>].<code class="varname">offset</code> = <code class="varname">url_start_offsets</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>];
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[i].<code class="varname">font</code> = <code class="constant">kURLFont</code>;
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[i].<code class="varname">color</code> = <code class="constant">kURLColor</code>;

  <span class="comment">// end the URL run</span>
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[i + 1].<code class="varname">offset</code> = <code class="varname">url_end_offsets</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>];
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[i + 1].<code class="varname">font</code> = <code class="constant">kNormalFont</code>;
  <code class="varname">theTRA</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">runs</code>[i + 1].<code class="varname">color</code> = <code class="constant">kNormalColor</code>;
}
</pre><p>
When you're done constructing your <span class="type">text_run_array</span>, simply pass it on to
<code class="classname">BTextView</code> as part of a call to
<code class="methodname">SetText()</code>, <code class="methodname">Insert()</code>, or more explicitly,
<code class="methodname">SetRunArray()</code>. Note that the offsets are always relative to the point
where you set/insert the text, or to the starting offset that you pass
into <code class="methodname">SetRunArray()</code>.
</p><p>
Now that you've successfully parsed for and displayed a <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym> in blue,
wouldn't it be nice if clicking on it did something?
</p><p>
Click-detection of a specific range of text in <code class="classname">BTextView</code> is pretty simple.
You already know the offsets of the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>s, so in your <code class="methodname">MouseDown()</code>
function, look at the offset of the click, and compare with the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>
offsets:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">MyTextView</code>::<code class="methodname">MouseDown</code>(
  <code class="classname">BPoint</code>  <code class="parameter">where</code>)
{
  <span class="comment">// this tells you the text offset of the click</span>
  <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">clickOffset</code> = <code class="methodname">OffsetAt</code>(<code class="parameter">where</code>);

  <span class="comment">// assume that FindURL() returns the URL of the click</span>
  <span class="comment">// or NULL if there wasn't a URL there</span>
  <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="varname">theURL</code> = <code class="methodname">FindURL</code>(<code class="varname">clickOffset</code>);

  if (<code class="varname">theURL</code> != <code class="constant">NULL</code>)
    <span class="comment">// while we're at it, send the user's preferred</span>
    <span class="comment">// HTML handler a message to open the URL</span>
    <code class="varname">be_roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Launch</code>("text/html", 1, &amp;<code class="varname">theURL</code>);
  else
    <span class="comment">// don't forget to call the original implementation!</span>
    <code class="classname">BTextView</code>::<code class="methodname">MouseDown</code>(<code class="parameter">where</code>);
}
</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id686589"></a>Tip 3</h3></div></div></div><p>
My final tip is about <code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s text buffer's performance. In order
to reduce the number of calls to <code class="function">realloc()</code>,
<code class="classname">BTextView</code> employs a "gapped"
text buffer. The buffer always allocates more memory than is currently
needed so that <code class="function">realloc()</code> doesn't have to be
called per <code class="methodname">KeyDown()</code>. The gap
is always after the insertion point, which means that it is often
somewhere in the middle of the buffer.
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BTextView</code>'s <code class="methodname">Text()</code>
function returns a <span class="type">const char*</span> to the buffer.
Consequently, it moves the gap to the end of the buffer, so that you may
index the pointer without any knowledge of the whereabouts and the size
of the gap. Therefore, calling <code class="methodname">Text()</code>
often on a <code class="classname">BTextView</code> (from within
<code class="methodname">InsertText()</code>, for example) is not desirable. If you need to peek at the
contents of the buffer, consider using <code class="methodname">ByteAt()</code>,
or <code class="methodname">GetText()</code>. Use <code class="methodname">Text()</code>
sparingly, preferably only for rare events such as writing the text into
a file.

One of Scott Adams' best Dilbert strips pokes fun at the standard
components of trade show booths: magic tricks, special effects, raffles,
and booth babes. "For the best result, combine all four: Create the
illusion that you're raffling off the booth babes." I'd add race cars to
the list. It stuns me to see a company pay $50K for prime trade show real
estate, plop down a Porsche Boxster that takes up half the space, and
then cram the actual product into the remainder.
</p><p>
Be has done a number of trade shows over the past few years, mostly
MacWorld and Fall Comdex, and recently in joint participation with
Adamation at NAB. We take pains to avoid an affliction known as "Trade
Show Fever"—the assumption that trade shows are a natural part of
doing business.
</p><p>
The costs associated with these extravaganzas are incredible, not only in
dollars but also in people resources. We've got a lot of work to do and
when we're at a trade show, for the most part, we're not getting other
work done. So you can expect to see us at PC Expo in June and Comdex in
November. We'll consider a couple of other shows, but before we sign up
we'll need to see extremely compelling reasons and clear paths to the
goals we desire to achieve by participating.
</p><p>
From our experience, here are a few tips to help you plan for your own
future trade show participation.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Alex's Law: Don't Suck. No explanation required. All suggestions
that follow will help you not to suck.
</p></li><li><p>
Pre-stage Equipment: If it works at home and you bring all the same
stuff, the odds of it working at the show are pretty good. With the
exception of one large demo machine, we rented machines for NAB
locally and brought hard disks. This led to hours of frustration as we
swapped video cards and hard disks, recreated partitions, and coaxed
uncooperative hardware into performing properly. There is a definite
tradeoff of time versus money, but often at a trade show, your
deadlines are your least flexible concern.
</p></li><li><p>
Bring an Extra System: I've never set up a trade show where every
piece of hardware worked properly. We always bring an extra system
along with us and pilfer parts to replace failed components.
</p></li><li><p>
People Are Responsible, Groups Are Not: Never assign any important
trade show task (like pre-staging the equipment) to a group of people;
there's a good chance it won't get done. Assign tasks to specific
individuals who are responsible for completing them. If the task
requires the help of others, that individual can delegate sub-tasks,
keep track of overall progress, and deal with problems that arise as
they happen.
</p></li><li><p>
Schedules Work: Set a booth schedule and stick to it. Make sure
your booth staff understands that the schedule is rigid. Remember,
though, that we are all human. Scheduling someone for 8 hours of demos
is shortsighted. They may have still be standing at a demo station at
the end of the day, but they won't be delivering demos that achieve
the desired effect.
</p><p>
I've found that people can give the large demo (the demo we do on two
large TV screens to attract people into the booth) effectively for two
hours at a time before their delivery goes slack. Alternating through
the main demo staff solves that problem. At the less demanding
(although no less important) one-on-one demo stations, four hours
seems to be the limit for effective delivery. After some food, a trip
to the bathroom, and a short walk, you can be ready to deliver again.
</p></li><li><p>
The Demo: I wrote an article in Newsletter #87
(http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue87.html) about how to
give a great demo. For a trade show, there are three basic demos you
should be prepared to do:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The main demo.
</p></li><li><p>
The one-on-one demo.
</p></li><li><p>
The "I don't have time for a demo" demo.
</p></li></ul></li></ol></div><p>
The main demo is the most important part of your trade show presentation,
apart from the spinning sign on top of the booth. This demo attracts
people into your booth to learn more about your product. This demo should
make the most of everything that's eye-catching about your product.
You've got to literally stop people in their tracks and make them pay
attention to you. Here's a tip for doing it: Any static image on a TV
screen is boring; any moving image, no matter how boring it is, is not
boring, and immediately attracts the eye.
</p><p>
This is generally how I begin to attract a crowd. I leave the system up
with a few movies playing, along with some other visual candy. I also
think it's important to let people know when the next demo will start so
they can decide to stay (FontDemo cycling through fonts is a good "Next
Demo at" tool).
</p><p>
Once you have a couple of people waiting, start your demo. People attract
people, so you'll build a crowd during the performance. Yes, this is a
performance, so it needs to be scripted in advance and taught to your
main demo staff—with enough time to practice. As for length, unless
your demo is capable of winning awards, you won't keep a crowd standing
around for more than 10 minutes. Show the highlights and invite them into
the booth for more in-depth one-on-one demos.
</p><p>
The one-on-one demo is more loosely organized and should be tailored to
each individual depending upon their area of interest. We don't show a
video developer support for printing to AppleTalk devices. One-on-one
demo staff must be comfortable showing off most aspects of the product
and able to customize their demo on the fly. If someone with no specific
area of interest is looking for a one-on-one demo, use an extended
version of the "I don't have time for a demo" demo.
</p><p>
The "I don't have time for a demo" demo is for people who want to see a
demo but only have 30 seconds. Be prepared to show them the three most
impressive aspects of your product. It matters less that they are the
most important or useful features, than that they can make someone say,
"Wow, show me more."
</p><p>
Finally, everyone in the booth should be able to give a demo. It never
fails that, with everyone busy giving demos, someone will walk up to you,
point to the one empty station, and ask for a demo.
</p><p>
Look good, be prepared, have fun. There are few things more immediately
gratifying than giving good demo. Oh, if you're in Vegas for Comdex, only
play the single decks and always SPLIT aces and 8's, never 10's, 5's, and
4's.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing3-17-2"></a>Guest Columnist: Seed Financing for Your BeOS Project</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Keith</span> <span class="surname">Bates</span></span></div></div></div><p>
So you think you have an amazing idea for the BeOS? It's potent.
Compelling. Promises jaw-dropping capabilities. You can't sleep anymore
because you're dreaming about it and you're coding every red-eyed moment
you're awake and you're drinking way too much coffee and every chance you
get you call your best friend to dream and scheme. There's only one small
problem: Where do you find the capital?
</p><p>
You could start with a venture capital seed fund. In venture parlance, a
"seed" fund is a capital pool aimed at small, very early stage and high
risk investments. Seed-stage companies are still in the process of
technology and product development; they have little or no revenue; they
are not yet engaged in marketing. This article will give you some
suggestions on what to think about and cover in your seed-stage business
plan. There are also a number of useful resources available on the Web
and in better booksellers that will be helpful to you in creating a plan
for your prospective investors.
</p><p>
The Eastern Technology Seed Investment Fund (ETSIF) is a C$25 million
(Canadian) venture capital fund created to provide financing and
management support for early stage technology projects in Eastern Canada
(Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces). ETSIF is distinguished by its very
early stage focus and its ability to bring both equity funding and
management support to technology opportunities. Most of ETSIF's initial
investments are made in opportunities which do not have revenue and which
are likely to require a number of rounds of venture financing before
becoming cash self-sufficient. ETSIF's initial commitment is generally in
the range of C$100,000 to C$500,000 but investments outside this range
will be considered.
</p><p>
We usually expect that our seed investment will be enough to get a
company started towards its first "milestone" achievement. Seed stage
generally is preparatory to a full-blown startup round of financing
(which may be in the several millions of dollars). During seed stage
several important objectives are tackled. First, the technology or
application is brought to prototype or beta stage. Second, the company's
management team is rounded out. Third, a comprehensive business plan is
researched and written, suitable for the raising of second round
financing. At the end of seed stage—typically an eight or ten month
period, perhaps shorter—companies will be able to move towards the
second round of financing.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id686940"></a>Key Criteria: Technology, People, Customers</h3></div></div></div><p>
At ETSIF we look for three essentials in any seed funding application:
technology, people, and customers. The inability of an applicant to
satisfy us on all of these points usually means we will not proceed
further. What follows is intended to give you a sense of how we typically
approach each of these three qualities, and what sorts of questions you
should ask yourself in devising your plan.
</p><p>
First, the technology must be powerful, compelling, unique. It should
generally either (a) give the user a power to do things that were
previously not possible, or (b) allow the user to save significant time
and money over their existing solution. Small increments will not do
here. It is no use saying that your solution is 20% better than the
software that is available today: Your real competition is the software
that is under development today. What will your advantage be when you
actually begin to sell your product? How long will it last? How deep and
wide will the moat be around your technology?
</p><p>
The second factor is the quality of the people. At seed stage the
fundamental focus is on the development team. We like to see a team
comprised of people who have the training and experience necessary to
extend and deepen the technology over time; who possess passion and vigor
and commitment and integrity; who can lay the right architectural
foundation; who can plan in detail and with wisdom; who can build with
discipline; who know the value and place of development tools and best
practices. Be sure to detail the backgrounds and individual
responsibilities of your team's members. Identify any gaps in the group,
and explain how you intend to fill them.
</p><p>
The last major criterion is a simple one, but too often overlooked:
customers. Who in the real flesh-and-blood world will pay hard money for
your product? How many of them are out there today? Next year? Don't
spend too much time dwelling on "markets," at least to begin with. Who
are your customers going to be? Who will beg to test your beta? Who will
buy your product? Better yet, who will pester their boss to buy your
product for them? Whose heart will pound the most? That's your customer.
Working backwards from that will help you see your markets. And sometimes
by going through this exercise you will discover all kinds of new
markets. If you know your customers, understand their needs and wants and
methods and fears and similarities and differences, then you will know
your market. And your knowledge will be of a kind that is meaningful,
deep, and practical.

Your seed plan should discuss, in reasonable detail, the three key
elements of technology, people, and customers.
</p><p>
Explain the technology development plan. Discuss architecture, design,
construction. We know the difficulties in scheduling complex projects
reliably; that's why we look for developers who understand "best
practices," and who have the iron discipline necessary to make excellent
use of a few useful control and quality tools. Define the key work
packages as far as you can. Sketch the real decision points and the rough
schedule. Outline the people and equipment that you will need. Divide
responsibility for development among your team. Explain the various
practices (daily builds, version controls, reviews, etc.) that you will
rely on to ensure that the development process is as controlled as
possible. Talk about the risks that worry you the most, and how you plan
to confront those risks.
</p><p>
If you can, make a basic budget. Here are some tips:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
"Get the money on the screen," as they say in the movie business;
don't fill out the budget with "lifestyle" salaries and hefty fringe
benefits and perks.
</p></li><li><p>
If you choose to forecast financial statements, then think cash
flow, not accounting profits.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
As to style: Avoid business jargon as much as possible. Jargon clouds
thinking and obscures meaning. It gives even original ideas a hackneyed,
worn feel. Think clearly. Build your case in logical steps. Write
crisply, decisively, on the things you truly understand. As Hemingway
said: "...write when you know something; and not before; and not too
damned much after."
</p><p>
Your business plan at the seed stage shouldn't be a book. Truly exciting
ideas need only a few pages to sell themselves; the bad ones cannot be
sold even with hundreds of pages. While every investor has different
requirements and tastes, the following suggestions may also prove useful
to you:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Forget mission statements. Your mission should be clear from your
plan.
</p></li><li><p>
Never gloss over or omit any risks, shortcomings, or unpleasant
truths.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't waste ink on pie charts, or on pretty graphs that show
limitless year-over-year growth in profits. Instead, use operational
diagrams of the sort that you would use inside a functioning
development company: Gantt charts, organizational and architectural
charts, clear tables, simple drawings, and so forth.
</p></li><li><p>
While with seed applicants we don't need or want a full-fledged
marketing plan, we do appreciate being given the rundown on the
existing product solutions that your customers are using, even if they
are not direct competition to your technology.
</p></li><li><p>
Footnotes are helpful. Include a glossary of technical terms used.
Directions to Web resources are also good. Append any particularly
relevant background articles from magazines or journals.
</p></li><li><p>
Always check spelling and grammar and make sure you understand the
specific requirements of your audience. Sloppiness hurts credibility.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id687075"></a>Resources</h3></div></div></div><p>
Take the time to learn how investors think. Read the "Red Herring"
http://www.redherring.com/ and "Upside" http://www.upside.com/ on a
regular basis, or skim back issues. Spend time carefully reviewing the
literature available on the investment funds you intend to apply to, so
that you accurately grasp the criteria of each. Pick up a copy of
Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm, (HarperBusiness, 1991). There are a
number of good books available on the writing of business plans; one very
good choice for technology startups is Gordon Bell's High Tech Ventures,
(Addison Wesley, 1991).

The BeOS platform affords numerous possibilities to build fast-growing
software companies. The great chance is to create software that couples
your own powerful insights with the explosive muscle of the BeOS, for
irresistible results.
</p><p>
We are interested in meeting Canadian BeOS developers who have truly
exciting software ideas, but who lack the capital and management support
to get properly underway. Canada is home to thousands of developers who
have spectacular strengths in digital media and animation. If you are in
Canada and want to discuss your own BeOS project, you are invited to
contact Keith Bates by telephone (416-861-2282) or e-mail
kbates@easternseed.com.
</p><p>
If you are thinking about applying to ETSIF, you should visit our site at
http://www.easternseed.com/, which authoritatively describes current
ETSIF criteria and guidelines, or request a copy of ETSIF's brochure.

About three days and a box. Seriously, Mr. Jarry has stumbled over one
of our undocumented command line tools (in /beos/bin). We'll officially
document them someday, but until then, regard...
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id687180"></a>addattr, catattr, listattr, rmattr</h3></div></div></div><p>
These tools perform attribute tricks, and are great for attribute
debugging. Almost anything that can be done programmatically (through the
BNode attribute functions) can be done from the command line with these
tools. All four of these tools return 0 upon success, and non-zero
otherwise (but with a caveat, as described in rmattr).
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="command">addattr</code> writes an attribute
(a name/value pair) into an existing file:
</p><div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">addattr</code> [-t type]  attr   value   file1  [file2 ...]</p></div><p>
"type" is one of:
</p><p>
<span class="type">string</span> (the default; 'text' and 'ascii' are synonyms)<br />
<span class="type">mime</span> (for MIME types)<br />
<span class="type">int</span> (for <span class="type">int32</span>)<br />
<span class="type">llong</span> (for <span class="type">int64</span>)<br />
<span class="type"><span class="type">float</span></span><br />
<span class="type"><span class="type">double</span></span>
</p><p>
If the attribute ("attr") already exists, it's replaced by the new
value—even if the new attribute is a different type.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="command">catattr</code> displays the value of a named attribute:
</p><div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">catattr</code>  attr   file1  [file2 ...]</p></div><p>
Each attribute is displayed in the form
</p><pre class="screen">
file : type : value
</pre><p>
The possible "type" values here are:
</p><p>
<span class="type">string</span> (all strings, including MIME types)<br />
<span class="type">int32</span><br />
<span class="type">int64</span><br />
<span class="type"><span class="type">float</span></span><br />
<span class="type"><span class="type">double</span></span><br />
<span class="type">raw_data</span> (all other types)
</p><p>
Notice that the types that are displayed by <code class="command">catattr</code> are slightly
different from those expected by <code class="command">addattr</code>. This endearing quirk may be
kicked into line someday.
</p><p>
The data for a <span class="type">raw_data</span> type attributes is displayed in a hexdump (hd)
style byte table.
</p><p>
Also, note that the "attr" argument isn't a wildcard; for example, you
can't dump all the attributes in a file by commanding "catattr * file".
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="command">listattr</code> dumps the names, types, and sizes—but not the values --
of the attributes in a file:
</p><div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">listattr</code>  file1  [file2 ...]</p></div><p>
For each file, a three-column table ("Type", "Size", "Name") is
displayed. The values in the "Type" column are—surprise—different
from those used by <code class="command">addattr</code> and <code class="command">catattr</code>:
</p><p>
Text<br />
MIME str<br />
Int-32<br />
Int-64<br />
Float<br />
Double
</p><p>
Unrecognized attribute types (constants) are printed in hex. The "Size"
column gives the size of the attribute in bytes; "Name" is the name of
the attribute.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that directories can have attributes themselves. <code class="command">listattr</code>
. lists the attributes in the current directory. If you want to list
the attributes in all the files in a directory, call <code class="command">listattr *</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="command">rmattr</code> removes a named attribute from a file:
</p><div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">rmattr</code>  attr   file1  [file2 ...]</p></div><p>
<code class="command">rmattr</code>'s return value shouldn't be trusted. It (properly) returns non-
zero if the arguments are invalid, but it (improperly) returns 0 if
something goes wrong while removing an attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="command">copyattr</code> also plays with attributes, but it's a much more involved
program. It copies the attributes and, optionally, data from one file
to another:
</p><div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><code class="command">copyattr</code> [options]  from_file1  [from_file2 ...]  to_file </p></div><p>
In its simplest use, copyattr copies all the attributes (names, types,
and values) from a source file (A) to a destination file (B):
copyattr A B
</p><p>
Destination attributes are clobbered in the case of duplicate attribute
names. When copying attributes only (i.e. not data), the destination
file must already exist.
</p><p>
To select a particular attribute (or set of attributes) use the -n or
-t options:
</p><p>
-n  The name of the attribute to copy<br />
-t  The type of attributes to copy
</p><p>
You can only specify one name or one type. The recognized types are:
</p><p>
<span class="type">string</span><br />
<span class="type">mimestr</span> (for MIME types)<br />
<span class="type">int64</span> (or "llong")<br />
<span class="type">int32</span> (or "int")<br />
<span class="type">int16</span><br />
<span class="type">int8</span><br />
<span class="type">boolean</span><br />
<span class="type"><span class="type">float</span></span>
</p><p>
The real power of <code class="command">copyattr</code> is as an attribute-aware replacement for
<code class="command">cp</code>. To tell <code class="command">copyattr</code> to copy data AND
attributes, you pass it the -d
option:
</p><pre class="screen">
copyattr -d A B
</pre><p>
When you're copying data as well as attributes, the destination file
needn't exist.
</p><p>
To recursively copy an entire directory, add the -r (recursive) switch:
</p><pre class="screen">
copyattr -d -r ADIR BDIR
</pre><p>
To move a directory, use '-d -r' as above, and then throw in the -m
(remove source) switch:
</p><pre class="screen">
copyattr -d -r -m ADIR BDIR
</pre><p>
Note that the copyattr command line switches can't be combined. You
have to use '-d -r -m', not '-drm'.
</p><p>
As with the other attribute programs, copyattr returns 0 if successful
and non-zero otherwise.

It's amazing what you find looking through archives on the Web. In this
case, obscure mutterings written in another time and another language.
Originally published on March 3rd, 1995 in the Parisian (and Leftist)
newspaper Libération, some parts have aged well—while others now
look decidedly bizarre.
</p><p>
Francophones can read the original at:
http://www.liberation.com/chroniques/ga950303.html
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id687755"></a>Whither Bill Gates? [March 1995]</h3></div></div></div><p>
A hundred dollars per year per computer—for now. Is this a new fund
raising idea from the government, a toll on the information highway, or
perhaps the PC equivalent of the TV license [the French pay a yearly
license for the use of a TV—supposedly for the "free" state
channels]? No, it's Microsoft's strategy, a very simple core idea
hidden behind multiple products, campaigns and announcements.
</p><p>
From the purchase of DOS in 1980 from a small company in Seattle
(before its adoption by IBM), to the announcement of Windows 95, Bill
Gates has worked from the same plan: develop, cajole, and ferociously
protect a worldwide installed base of 90 million PCs. Once control is
established, tax the installed base in the form of new or revised
software. Average "obligatory" expenditure: A hundred dollars a year.
</p><p>
Operating system. In French, "systéme d'exploitation"—"exploitation
system". We are warned.
</p><p>
An exaggeration? Let's look at the facts. Today, Microsoft controls
about 90% of the market for PC operating systems, more than 70% of
office automation applications under Windows, and more than 80% on the
Macintosh. As if this wasn't enough, the latest generation of its
systems—Windows NT and, soon, Windows 95—will strengthen
Microsoft's share of an entire spectrum of markets, from office
computers to large systems. In the meantime, Gates will have spread
himself to databases and programming languages. He'll have closed the
1.6 billion dollar acquisition of Quicken, the champion of the very
American hobby of home accounting; and he'll have leveraged this
investment through an agreement with Visa that will combine Quicken
with their credit card services.
</p><p>
At home or at the office, Microsoft is the toll gate: Whether in
entertainment or education, Microsoft's CD-ROMs dominate the market and
Gates is hard at work developing multimedia products with his Hollywood
connections. In the enterprise market, he wants to federate telephones,
fax machines, and copiers.
</p><p>
And that's not the end of it as Bill Gates feverishly works on projects
such as Microsoft Network, which targets CompuServe, Calvacom [a French
service] and the Internet, or its Tiger standard intended for the
domination of interactive TV, or Teledesic, the satellite
telecommunication project set up with billionaire Craig McCaw, the king
of cellular telephony in the US.
</p><p>
Never has a company incarnated the spectre of dominant position as
fully as Microsoft does—not even IBM at the height of its antitrust
troubles. Bill Gates denies all this with admirable chutzpah: think of
the gigantic investments! the ferocious competition! the fragility of
being on top!... Microsoft is merely a small ship on the threatening
oceans of a competitive marketplace.
</p><p>
This doesn't amuse the industry brethren.
</p><p>
Jim Manzi, president of Lotus, would like to know how to compete in the
office market against an opponent that develops both the operating
system and the applications, a conjunction that gives Microsoft's word
processor and spreadsheet a crushing advantage. Microsoft Office is
designed from within to work with Windows while Lotus must content
itself with Microsoft's technical documentation—and trust
Microsoft's word.
</p><p>
Such striking success generates bitter accusations of Microsoft's
misuse of their dominant position, of ethical as well as legal breaches.
</p><p>
The success of Microsoft owes much to Bill Gates' intelligence, his
energy, and his ability to see and willingness to seize opportunities.
These were many over the years, as his opponents, weakened by
incompetence and internecine struggles, tremulously clung to the good
old ways. Gates plays all positions well, his authority is
unquestioned, he's been at the helm for twenty years and, if he wants,
he'll be in charge for another twenty or more. In his defense of the
Microsoft system, he claims that without the standard he created and
ferociously evangelized, the industry wouldn't have enjoyed the rapid
and "harmonious" growth leading to its incredible prosperity. So go the
arguments of enlightened despots. But when they succeed too well and
for too long, they overshoot the point of optimal service to the
community and end up doing harm to their own ecological niche. For
Microsoft, the question is posed in these political terms. The time has
come to acknowledge that the industry can no longer render unto
Microsoft.
</p><p>
Bill Gates has the means to elegantly transmutate his image from
wealthy despot into benevolent visionary: All he has to do is put
Windows in the public domain, provide the source code and documentation
through the Internet. Entrepreneurs would be free to modify and improve
upon the standard, customers would be free to pick the best product.
</p><p>
This might cost Bill Gates one or two billion dollars of the five or
six of his personal fortune today. But that's a rather abstract price
for a very real place in history. Freed from suspicion, Bill Gates
would become a legend, and would be able to throw himself into the
boundless enjoyment of competition in the applications market.
</p><p>
One can dream.
</p></div><p>
It's three years and an (almost) automatic translation program later.
As with all reminiscence, the views expressed here don't necessarily
represent those of the author (any more). But...
</p><p>
The hand-wringing over the Quicken and Teledesic deals was premature;
but the Microsoft strategy and the poor little rich kid attitude is
still with us. Recall their words when they entered the Internet market
in 1996:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
“<span class="quote">What you're seeing here is competition, which is good and
healthy. Now we have Netscape's Navigator and Sun's
Javasoft as our new competitors.</span>”
</p></blockquote></div><p>
More importantly, the events of the last year have again proven that
the palace isn't safe when there's discontent in the village. Is it too
late for Louis '98 to open the gates to Versailles?
