When we decided to move networking into the kernel for the networking
rewrite, some kernel team gangstas dragged me down a dark alley and
roughed me up a little. Realizing that I was becoming an honorary member
of the kernel team, they had to jump me into the gang and lay down the
law.
</p><p>
"Rule #1," said Ficus, "is NO C++ IN THE KERNEL. When you find yourself
hankering to overload operators in kernel code, ABSTAIN, DUMMY!"
</p><p>
It may come as a surprise to some BeOS developers that in our wonderful,
buzzword-enabled, OO-powered OS, there is not a single line of C++ code
in the kernel. There are many reasons for this, none of which will appear
in this article.
</p><p>
Many experienced C programmers have been writing object oriented code in
C for years. This article is geared towards C++ programmers who haven't
coded much in pure C since college but are interested in doing drivers or
kernel modules, and at C programmers who just hadn't thought of this
before.
</p><p>
The moral of the story is, "There's no reason to let lack of language
syntactic sugar keep you from writing good, solid object oriented code."
</p><p>
The best way to illustrate OO programming in C is to jump right in to
code. The sample code for this article is available at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/languages/ObjectOrientedC.zip&gt;
</p><p>
Consider a base class, and a subclass that inherits from the base class
and includes both public and private data:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">/* from class.h in the sample code */</span>

<span class="comment">/*

 */</span>
typedef <span class="type">struct myBaseClass</span>
{
    <span class="type">char               *</span><code class="varname">name</code>;
    <span class="type">int</span>                 <code class="varname">id</code>;
    <span class="type">struct myBaseClass *</span><code class="varname">next</code>;
} <span class="type">myBaseClass</span>;

<span class="comment">/*
 * inherited class definition.  Note inheritance through
 * aggregation of the base class as the first member
 * of the struct.
 */</span>
typedef <span class="type">struct myInheritedClass</span>
{
    <span class="type">myBaseClass</span> <code class="varname">base</code>;
    <span class="type">uint32</span>      <code class="varname">public_data</code>;
    <span class="type">void        *</span><code class="varname">private_data</code>;
    <span class="type">void</span>        (*<code class="varname">public_action</code>)(<span class="type">struct myInheritedClass *</span>);
    <span class="type">void</span>        (*<code class="varname">private_action</code>)(<span class="type">struct myInheritedClass *</span>);
} <span class="type">myInheritedClass</span>;
</pre><p>
These are declared in a public header file, which we'll call
<code class="filename">class.h</code>. For
this example, <code class="filename">class.h</code>
contains the class declarations and
construction/destruction function declarations;
<code class="filename">class.c</code> contains the
class implementation; and <code class="filename">main.c</code>
contains the code which uses the classes.
</p><p>
Several interesting things are going on here. Classes are obviously
represented in C as structs. The classes can contain either data members,
or member functions.
</p><p>
Inheritance is accomplished by simply aggregating the base class struct
as the first member of the subclass.
</p><p>
Public data encapsulation is accomplished via simple aggregation of the
data type or a reference to it. Private data encapsulation is
accomplished by hiding the actual private data by referencing it via a
<span class="type">void*</span>, and providing member functions to access the actual data.
</p><p>
Since C has no scope resolution operator to allow direct implementation
of class member functions, the member functions for the class (public
action and private action) would need to be declared and defined as
standard C functions (presumably static to the module they are in) and
assigned to the member function pointers in the class.
</p><p>
Note that these class declarations describe abstract classes. Concrete
subclasses are accessed through the interface specified by the abstract
class declaration. This gives us polymorphism, the third part of the
sacred OO trinity along with inheritance and encapsulation.
</p><p>
Since C has no constructors and destructors, an allocator function must
be provided for each concrete subclass type. For example, if you wanted
to make three concrete subclasses from the <code class="classname">myInheritedClass</code> abstract
interface called "one", "two", and "three", the following functions would
be defined:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">/*
 * allocator and deallocator prototypes
 */</span>
extern <span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span><code class="function">new_one</code>(<span class="type">int</span>);
extern <span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span><code class="function">new_two</code>(<span class="type">int</span>);
extern <span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span><code class="function">new_three</code>(<span class="type">int</span>);
</pre><p>
Each of these functions would allocate the memory for the classes,
initialize all the data members of the classes (and their base classes),
allocate the private data members for each class and assign them to the
private data pointer, and assign function pointers to the member
functions. The <code class="function">new*</code> functions take an <span class="type">int</span> argument here and assign the
value to a member variable, as we'll see, much like a C++ constructor
might take an <span class="type">int</span> argument to initialize a data member if desired.
</p><p>
The corresponding delete functions
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
extern <span class="type">void</span>             <code class="function">delete_one</code>(<span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span>);
extern <span class="type">void</span>             <code class="function">delete_two</code>(<span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span>);
extern <span class="type">void</span>             <code class="function">delete_three</code>(<span class="type">myInheritedClass *</span>);
</pre><p>
would deallocate the space used by the classes and their private data.
</p><p>
For implementation, any functions relating to the internal state of any
given class will be colocated in the .c file implementing that class. Any
code which is a consumer of the class will only be able to use the class
through its interface as specified in a header file. This helps insure
encapsulation.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">new *</code> and <code class="function">delete *</code>
functions would (of course) be implemented in the
same file as the specific subclass is implemented. One way to write one
of the <code class="function">new *</code> functions would be

</pre><p>
Two interesting things here. First, a static global instance of the
specific subclass is created with most of the fields initialized,
particularly the member functions. This is then copied to create specific
instances of the class in the new function, and instance-specific data
members are then initialized there.
</p><p>
Next, the private encapsulation through data hiding via (<span class="type">void *</span>) is
illustrated by the allocation of the one private data structure and its
assignment to the opaque (<span class="type">void *</span>) private data pointer.
</p><p>
To wrap it up, remember the important point that these implementations
are in a file not directly referenced by code that uses these classes;
the only interface visible to them is the declarations of the class
structures (and the class' member functions), and the
<code class="function">new *</code> and <code class="function">delete *</code>
functions. The sample code illustrates this. Here is how the classes are
used, in a separate source file:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

There you have it, object inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in
C. In this example, inheritance is used by aggregating <code class="classname">myBaseClass</code> as the
first member of <code class="classname">myInheritedClass</code>; encapsulation is provided by having
both public and hidden data members, with the only way to get at the
private data types being member functions that know how to access them;
and polymorphism, which is provided by the struct definitions for the
classes acting as an abstract class interface from which concrete classes
are created.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id823480"></a>Volatility</h3></div></div></div><p>
One thing I've noticed lately in other people's code is the use, or
rather the lack of use, of the <code class="code">volatile</code> keyword.
</p><p>
Essentially, one should declare something <code class="code">volatile</code> if its value will be
changed asynchronously by code executing in parallel to other threads
using it, especially if the value is tested inside of loops and such. The
reason for this is that the compiler has no way of knowing that a
variable may be modified by something outside the codeblock it's
currently compiling and may do optimizations that involve code motion,
such as hoisting assignments or comparisons out of loops, or locally
caching the value of a variable once instead of checking the value stored
in its real memory location on each loop iteration. Declaring the
variable <code class="code">volatile</code> lets the compiler know that it isn't free to make these
kinds of optimizations with respect to that variable.
</p><p>
The classic example is for variables that are updated at interrupt time,
such as driver registers. But the same is true of variables that may be
changed in another thread. If your execution path depends on testing the
value of a variable in a loop, and the value may be changed
asynchronously by another thread, then you need to declare that variable
volatile.

In a multithreaded system like BeOS, the most critical issue is the
synchronization of simultaneous tasks. The BeOS kernel provides one
synchronization tool, the semaphore, but not all synchronization problems
are best addressed this way. In particular, software designed for other
operating systems where semaphores are not the primary synchronization
tool can be difficult to rewrite using other primitives.
</p><p>
In the Unix world, for example, the basic synchronization primitive is
the "condition variable," or "CV" for short. Superficially, CVs behave
similarly to semaphores. When a thread waits on the CV, it blocks until
some other thread signals that CV. The first thread then awakens and
continues executing.
</p><p>
Signalling a condition variable is analogous to releasing a semaphore.
The difference between them is in what happens when they're signalled (or
released) when no threads are waiting. A semaphore "remembers" the
signal; a thread that later tries to acquire the semaphore will succeed
immediately because of the earlier signal. In contrast, condition
variables don't remember whether they were signalled: if no threads are
waiting when the CV is signalled, the signal is "lost," and has no effect.
</p><p>
In this week's article I'll present a condition variable implementation
for BeOS. The interface is similar to the POSIX threads API for
familiarity and ease of porting. Building a CV implementation using only
semaphores turns out to be quite complex, so I'll just explain the code's
behavior here and leave the detailed analysis of its workings until next
week. You can download the code and an example program that uses it at
this URL:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/portability/condvar.zip&gt;
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I don't have enough space here to discuss condition
variable semantics in detail. I recommend a good POSIX threads book for
this. My personal favorite is David Butenhof's Programming With POSIX
Threads , but the O'Reilly Pthreads book is also good. I'm also trying to
avoid typing too much because of a hand injury, so for now, I'll just
summarize the interface and the example program.
</p><p>
Condition variables are tightly associated with a locking primitive
called a "mutex," so the library provides a C interface to both. Here are
the APIs for both:

Mutex operations are a lot like <code class="classname">BLocker</code> operations; I won't discuss them
much here, except to say that, unlike a semaphore, a mutex can only be
unlocked by the same thread that locked it. This provides a stronger
locking guarantee.
</p><p>
<code class="function">be_cond_wait()</code> and <code class="function">be_cond_timedwait()</code>
are the operations for blocking on
the condition variable. They're identical except for the timeout
semantic: <code class="function">be_cond_wait()</code> blocks forever,
and <code class="function">be_cond_timedwait()</code> blocks
until the specified time. That time is *absolute*, not relative, and in
this implementation it uses the same time base as the kernel's
<code class="function">system_time()</code> function. If you want to block until 10 seconds into the future,
you pass (<code class="code">system_time() + 10000000</code>) as the timeout value. Note that there
is a mutex argument to these functions: that mutex *must* be locked when
the wait function is called, and the mutex is guaranteed to be locked
when the function returns, even if the function returns an error.
</p><p>
<code class="function">be_cond_signal()</code> awakens one waiting thread,
and <code class="function">be_cond_broadcast()</code>
awakens *all* waiting threads. It's not necessary for any mutex to be
locked when either of these two signalling functions is called.
</p><p>
It's important that your code test the condition you're interested in
before blocking on the condition variable, and then test it again after
awakening. For example, in the sample Alarm app, the condition is "the
alarm queue is not empty." When waiting on this condition, the code looks
like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
while (<code class="varname">alarm_list</code> == <code class="constant">NULL</code>)
{
     <code class="function">be_cond_wait</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">alarm_cond</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">alarm_mutex</code>);
}
</pre><p>
This before-and-after testing is necessary because in certain rare
circumstances the waiting thread may awaken without the condition
variable being signalled. This is called a "spurious wakeup." The POSIX
spec explicitly permits such behavior because preventing it can make CV
implementations far less efficient.
</p><p>
The Alarm sample is a direct rewrite of Example 3.3.4 in the Butenhof
book cited above. It repeatedly asks the user for an alarm time,
expressed as a number of seconds into the future, and a message
associated with that time. It then issues the message at that time. The
code is heavily commented to explain how the condition variable is being
used, and illustrates both regular and timed waiting. If you're new to
condition variables, I recommend playing with the sample application,
reading through the code, and thinking about how the implementation would
be different if based on semaphores.
</p><p>
That's it for this article. Next week I'll look at the CV implementation
itself, and explain why its unusual approach was necessary to guarantee
the correct semantics.

After the fact, everything is much clearer and (almost) everyone is much
wiser. The latest episode in the Palm saga is (almost) no exception to
that rule and... rather than pile on more retroactive wisdom, I'd like to
focus on little fractures, on amusing ironies below the surface of the
story. Who knows, the tale might contain forward wisdom for us to use, if
we act decisively, before it turns retroactive.
</p><p>
A caveat before I proceed: I'm a director of 3Com. As a result, an even
larger grain of salt should be required when considering my opinion on
Palm matters. All I have is an opinion—I don't deal in Truth.
</p><p>
Let's remember how Palm started. They built PDA software and licensed it
to Casio and Sharp—following the approved business model. For the
founders, Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, this became a frustrating
experience in the midst of The PDA Part I, First Blood. Go and Eo came
out, as did Microsoft's hommage to the idea, PenWindows. Then we had
General Magic, the Newton, and—I was going to forget—Momenta. Let's
say about half a billion dollars "invested" in "refining the concept."
</p><p>
In that context, Donna and Jeff had a hard time dealing with their
Japanese licensees, who were too cautious, too slow, and too unwilling to
invest in new versions of the hardware platform. So Palm's founders went
to their Board and committed blasphemy: "Let's take control of our
future. We know where we want to go, so let's build hardware that
implements our vision".
</p><p>
The answer was a very polite "Let's find a strategic partner." Or more
plainly: "These guys are crazy, let's sell the company." And, indeed, US
Robotics successfully adopted Palm. The hardware was manufactured and
well distributed in a retail channel that US Robotics knew how to feed.
The founders, though, still felt uncomfortable, misunderstood, and
somewhat disrespected by the strong US Robotics culture—a feeling that
appeared to be mutual.
</p><p>
When 3Com acquired US Robotics, Palm wasn't very visible yet and not much
was made of that part of the acquisition at the time. Donna and Jeff had
great hopes for the relationship with their new adoptive parent. Sales
kept growing. The Palm Pilot was now quite visible and had become market
leader.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, CE appeared and went through several revisions. Many felt that
Palm had to avoid being "Appled," that is, left isolated on a proprietary
island. Palm's management resisted the change, the move to a new business
model, even at a time when addiction to hardware margins hadn't set in
yet—mainly by "virtue" of their absence.
</p><p>
In the early days, Palm sales grew rapidly, but the product wasn't making
money. This encouraged some to push for a bloodless transition. Palm's
founders found themselves frustrated again and lobbied for their freedom,
as a spin-off. They felt misunderstood and stifled by the larger company.
In 1998, a spin-off would have destroyed the favorable tax treatment of
the US Robotics acquisition, coming too soon after its June 1997 closing.
Donna, Jeff, and Ed Colligan left—with a Palm OS license—and
started Handspring, a PDA company.
</p><p>
A year later, 3Com feels it can spin off Palm without unfavorable tax
consequences and can realize value for its shareholders. Handspring
announces a Pilot clone with an interesting approach to hardware
modularity. It looks exciting—I've registered on their Web site to be
notified of the product's availability.
</p><p>
So, what do we have? A soon-to-be-independent company, prepped for an
IPO, just as the founders wanted—but without them. A strong,
independent, creative Pilot clone maker, something the founders didn't
want—but from them. Was the Pilot successful because Palm took control
of both hardware and software, or in spite of that move? Likewise, are
Apple's current fortunes exemplary or nonsensical? Is the PDA ecosystem
better off because the founders left to start a muscular venture-backed
(Kleiner, Benchmark et al.) clone? Or would the ecosystem be better off
with the founders running a spun-off Palm, but without Handspring? In
sum, is the Palm saga exemplary or totally accidental?
