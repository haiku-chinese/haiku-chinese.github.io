Inspecting the include files for Be application development reveals a
uniform absence of multiple inheritance. I may be the only proponent of
multiple inheritance at Be, but there are surely others in the developer
community. This article encourages the use of this key C++ structuring
mechanism, while identifying certain dangers which are particular to the
Be world.
</p><p>
The sources of dangers which I discuss are threads, dynamic <code class="classname">BObject</code>s, and
C++ itself. This three-headed Hydra incapacitates unwary programs without
warning. I have prepared a code sample, preserved in alcohol, for your
inspection.
</p><p>
Be threads, integral to BeOS, provide a powerful programming methodology.
Common within operating systems for decades, multiple control-flow is
finally emerging for use by application writers. Unfortunately, far
greater care is required in this environment, and knowledge of concepts
like synchronization is crucial. Furthermore, programs run
nondeterministically, hindering the bug search.
</p><p>
Like any C++ object, a <code class="classname">BObject</code> encapsulates data. However, some exhibit
dynamic behavior beyond the semantics of the language. A <code class="classname">BWindow</code>, for
example, has effects on the screen, the operating system, and the state
of the team. One notable effect is the asynchronous appearance of a new
thread. <code class="classname">BWindow</code>s also make a habit of deleting themselves.
</p><p>
Consider the skillful blending of the C language with a pit of vipers:
the result could be likened to C++. Given the resulting performance,
portability and industry support, C++ is a reasonable choice by Be.
However, this presumes the application writer can develop immunity to the
venom. The lack of garbage collection and the matter of object
construction and destruction are an enduring pain.
</p><p>
Described superficially, multiple inheritance moves member objects into
the list of base classes. In the following example, a <code class="classname">BLocker</code> and a
<code class="classname">BControl</code> comprise a new class. Class <code class="classname">X</code>
uses membership, but is unable to
invoke the <code class="classname">BControl</code> (<code class="methodname">BControl::Invoke</code>
is a protected function). Class <code class="classname">Y</code>
uses multiple inheritance, successfully. The code for <code class="classname">Y</code> is better
structured, better protected, and looks cleaner.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">X</span> {
  <code class="methodname">X</code>( ): <code class="varname">c</code>( <code class="methodname">BRect</code>( ), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) {
    <code class="varname">l</code>.<code class="methodname">Lock</code>( );
    <code class="varname">c</code>.<code class="methodname">Invoke</code>( );    <span class="comment">// illegal!</span>
  }
  <code class="classname">BControl</code> <code class="varname">c</code>;
  <code class="classname">BLocker</code> <code class="varname">l</code>;
};

struct <span class="type">Y</span>: <code class="classname">BLocker</code>, <code class="classname">BControl</code> {
  <code class="methodname">Y</code>( ): <code class="methodname">BControl</code>( <code class="methodname">BRect</code>( ), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) {
    <code class="methodname">Lock</code>( );
    <code class="methodname">Invoke</code>( );
  }
};
</pre><p>
Even if <code class="classname">X</code> were legal, the interaction of
<code class="classname">X</code> with <code class="classname">BControl</code> and <code class="classname">BLocker</code>
would be a mess. Pointers to all objects would have to be exchanged, and
declarations of friendship thrown around like confetti. In C++, <code class="code">friend</code>
destroys the distinction between <code class="code">protected</code> and <code class="code">private</code>. With <code class="code">friend</code>
like this, who needs <code class="code">enemy</code>?
</p><p>
The real dividends of multiple inheritance come from data sharing within
a subset of a larger object. This is achieved with "virtual base
classes". The complexity of <code class="classname">BObject</code>s, and their derivatives, makes such
structuring highly desirable.
</p><p>
Two classes can cooperate with a virtual class, which contains shared
data and linkage to functions for each other's use. The degree of sharing
is determined mutually and the name spaces do not otherwise collide, as
would happen if a hierarchy were imposed (one class derived from the
other). Also, a hierarchy permits sharing in one direction only.
</p><p>
The other way to arrange sharing between "sibling" objects is through an
object which is derived from both classes. This approach is inferior
because shared data in the object will migrate toward the root, again
causing name trouble. Function linkage will be clumsy since pure virtual
functions cannot be employed from that direction.
</p><p>
As promised, here is our preserved code specimen, depicting the best in
code structure, but also foolhardy regard for the Hydra. The code is
necessarily small for this article, but runs nicely. Finding the same
bugs in a large-scale program is no cakewalk, as you can imagine.

</pre><p>
<code class="classname">V</code> represents the shared portion of a
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> <code class="classname">W</code> and a
<code class="classname">BHandler</code> <code class="classname">H</code>. <code class="classname">W</code> and <code class="classname">H</code>
are bonded by the aggregate object <code class="classname">S</code>, which plays no role, except for
startup and shutdown. Ideally, <code class="methodname">V::fm</code> is pure; for our demo, it prints a
warning.
</p><p>
On startup, the program immediately creates a window which you can move.
For the next 10 seconds, moving the window illuminates three bugs.
</p><p>
Firstly, <code class="methodname">W::FrameMoved</code> is being called, but the
<code class="classname">W</code> constructor (<code class="methodname">W::W</code>) has
not completed. There are two separate threads running in W, without any
provision for interlocks. Even with interlocks, this scenario would make
little sense.
</p><p>
Secondly, <code class="classname">W</code> is being used before fully constructed. This is often
acceptable, but the utmost care is required. The obvious case is the
constructor itself. The order of object construction is well-defined in
C++ (tediously so). In our example, that care is lacking: variable <code class="varname">u</code> is
being used before set.
</p><p>
Thirdly, the function <code class="methodname">V::fm</code> is being called before
linkage to <code class="methodname">H::fm</code> has
been established. This seems unintuitive, since <code class="classname">V</code> has been constructed
(observe the value of <code class="varname">z</code>). But construction of <code class="methodname">H::fm</code> has not started, so
C++ mandates no linkage. Do you feel faint? Do your limbs feel numb?
That's the C++ venom coursing through your veins.
</p><p>
The `snooze' call freezes the program during an embarrassing phase of its
initialization, for easy inspection. In a real Be app, this phase might
be manifest on certain occasions only: the dreaded timing-sensitive bug.
</p><p>
When developing a Be app, it is critical to understand the dynamic nature
of <code class="classname">BObject</code>s like <code class="classname">BWindow</code>s and
<code class="classname">BView</code>s. Firstly, they must be created with
the <code class="function">new</code> operator. Secondly, they <code class="function">delete</code> themselves. Therefore, an
aggregate like <code class="classname">S</code> must contain no more than one instance of such an object.
</p><p>
In conclusion, the complexity of large applications in the Be environment
can be contained by multiple inheritance. The sceptics should note that
single inheritance must confront almost all the issues of multiple
inheritance, while enjoying far fewer benefits. Therefore, open your
copies of the C++ ARM, and start hacking. And beware the Hydra!

Like most of the developers that have written in this column, we at
Opalis loved the Be adventure from the first time we heard of it. Having
worked on Windows NT, I immediately felt comfortable with the advanced
features of the BeOS and decided that we should help and participate as
much as possible, especially since there's a lot of French guys involved
here...
</p><p>
Our speciality, networking and business systems, may not sound like the
ideal Be target, but I'm sure the BeBox, with its high-level
capabilities, can make a contribution in a "regular" company—it's not
just a video/audio editing machine. (I'm also sure that the Box has a
place in the home. That's why we're studying IHS applications, but that's
another story...)
</p><p>
The first program we're developing for the BeOS is an implementation of
OpalisRobot, our event-driven scheduler. This is a general tool that
includes something like an extended cron. A description (and, soon, the
first version) is available at www.opalis.com/opr_beos.html. If your
application needs to schedule some tasks or to detect special system
events, you won't have to rewrite yet-another- scheduler, you'll be able
to use OpalisRobot for BeOS, probably for free.
</p><p>
The second project—a personal one—is IPv6 over Ethernet and ATM. I
spend all my free time on it, and if all goes well, we should have this
in a year. I'll certainly release some parts before, such as ATM drivers.
This is a big challenge for me, and also for the BeBox, since some ATM
adapters and switches can go very fast. For example, Sun just released a
622 Mb/s adapter (of course, it does not fit on a PCI slot, unless you
use a hammer).
</p><p>
Many thanks to the Be team for this exciting box. Please always stay on
the wild side...

BeMall is an initiative from Opalis. While working on the BeBox as
developers, we thought it was a good idea to set up something to promote
the BeBox and help developers sell their BeOS applications.
</p><p>
BeMall offers several services:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A repository for developer information in the Web site. You will find
helpful information and source code in the Developer Exchange and Help
City sections. If you're developing for the BeBox, please consider
sharing your knowledge and code with other developers.
</p></li><li><p>
A repository of BeOS freeware and shareware. This is mainly for
people who don't have storage on the Internet and want to use the
BeMall site as a primary location for their programs. It's not our
intention to compete with ftp.be.com or with big repository sites, but
to be an additional site for selected files.
</p></li><li><p>
A registration service for shareware authors. We can also help
authors package and market their applications.
</p></li><li><p>
A mail order catalog (and, soon, an Internet e-shop) for commercial
BeOS applications and selected hardware. Right now, BeMall features the
first ever BeOS commercial application (Metrowerks CodeWarrior) at the
most competitive price. You can freely subscribe to our mailing list on
the Web site.
</p></li></ul><p>
We have other projects such as periodic CD-ROM or a magazine, but we need
your input! Please answer to our survey Web page at
www.BeMall.com/survey.html.

This Sunday, I was paying my weekly visit to Fry's Electronics in Palo
Alto. For those of you unfamiliar with this emporium, it's a cornucopia
of items with but one common attribute: They all appeal to geeks, nerds,
and technofreaks. Each of the Fry's stores has a theme; the Palo Alto
outlet is decorated to resemble a Western saloon, complete with the heads
of several farm animals stuck onto the wall. So, gentle reader, please
imagine the setting: bright fluorescent lights, doleful cows surveying
the scene from their vantage points on the wall, aisle upon aisle of
electronics and, it being early on a Sunday, very few people trudging
around.
</p><p>
I round a corner, in search of an elusive cable, and bump into a former
colleague with whom I worked at a Major Workstation Company. It's nice to
see him; we've not seen each other for about three years. We exchange
pleasantries and I hand him my Be business card. He raises his eyebrows
and asks me what Be does.
</p><p>
"We've created a brand-new operating system and a multiprocessor computer
and are marketing it to digital content application developers," say I.
</p><p>
My friend backs away, his face showing a mixture of surprise,
apprehension, and pity. He clearly believes that my tray table is not in
the fully locked and upright position and, after a few more pleasantries,
we separate, each in search of the little pieces of electronics that will
satisfy us today.
</p><p>
It was only later that I pondered on this brief encounter. My Fry's
friend was not the first person to imply, or even openly state, that what
Be is doing is crazy, or at least eccentric. Several posters to
comp.sys.be have asked fellow netizens for their arguments in favor of
Be, because their friends have told them that we're crazy.
</p><p>
We can argue that a good proof of sanity is demonstrated success.
Definitions of success vary, but Be's includes respect for our
technology, broad acceptance of the BeOS and low-cost MP computers
running the BeOS, satisfied and profitable developers and happy customers
doing cool things. We could write this into a florid mission statement,
but.....nah!
</p><p>
We've reached a stage of development at which the probabilities of
success are leaning in our favor. If we consider the reasons why
start-ups fail, some of the most common are lack of funds, uninteresting
technology, no clearly-identified target market, overwhelming
competition, or a poor team. Right now, through a welcome round of
adequate financing (using the "just in time" principle), technology that
excites people, a market space that's large enough to be interesting yet
small enough to be well-defined, no direct competitor (yet), and the best
team of engineers, marketers, and support people that I've had the
privilege to work with—things look quite positive.
</p><p>
We can also argue that however much a single company may appear to
dominate, there's always at least 20% of the market that's inaccessible
to the dominant player. That 20% comprises customers that are looking for
something a little different, a little special, or a little more useful
for their particularly unusual task. Our target market is that 20%:
Unique people with unusual needs.
</p><p>
We could strongly debate using reductio ad absurdum: Does our protagonist
believe that the current UNIX/Windows/MacOS trio of dominant operating
systems will prevail for ever? Probably not. How about for 50 years?
Seems a little too long. 20 years? Still too much. 10 years? Well... So,
when WILL an alternative emerge? Could it be now? Could it be the BeOS?
</p><p>
There are other arguments, many of them founded upon the "look at the
product and tell me if you see something special and useful" approach.
</p><p>
We could argue forever. Or we could get on with building the products.
</p><p>
Even so, people still think we're crazy.
</p><p>
And that makes it all the more fun.

A few years ago, jaded observers said our industry had entered maturity,
we were getting our AARP card in the mail. Without saying it in so many
words, they meant that everything new had been invented already, life was
going down an incrementally boring path, taking gross margins with it.
But this was before (among other things) the phenomenal increase in
processor power and, of course, the rise of the Internet from the Unix
geek underground, thanks to Tim Berners-Lee's HTML.
</p><p>
As a result, instead of operating systems and processor wars, we now have
the war of the two browsers. At stake is nothing less than the control of
the huge streams of money about to be carried by Intranets and the
Worldwide Web. For businesses, Intranets represent a new level of cost
and flexibility in delivering client-server applications.
</p><p>
In many respects, the browser is a New Age incarnation of the Common User
Access (CUA), the one client/one user interface to corporate IS resources
that was promoted "Web aeons" ago by IBM. Netscape's genius—I should
say Jim Clark's genius—has been to see this and go for it as only he,
Silicon Valley money, and egos fueled by a strong dose of anti- Microsoft
sentiment can. Said sentiment was not lost on its object, but Microsoft
is used to it. They know how to harness the hostility and envy of others
to their own business goals. More importantly, Microsoft understands that
this is about control. Netscape and their allies want to take control of
a huge portion of the computing business, one that is indeed Microsoft's
next target after winning control of office productivity: enterprise
computing.
</p><p>
The operating system is a commodity, said Netscape, the new platform is
the browser, a cross-operating system platform at that. A new genre of
computing is emerging on that platform, and Netscape is the drummer, not
Microsoft.
</p><p>
The response was remarkable and reminds us of why Microsoft is Microsoft.
From the Pearl Harbor anniversary speech last Fall, to the recent
delivery of version 3.0 of Explorer, the strategy was courageous and
insightful—and the execution flawless. This might be viewed as
unfortunate by the many who claim Microsoft's dominance is excessive
already, but it is a fact, nonetheless.
</p><p>
The latest version of Microsoft's browser looks pretty good to me. I've
downloaded both Navigator and Explorer 3.0 versions on my home Windows 95
system and I no longer feel Navigator to be markedly superior to
Explorer. In many respects, I like Explorer's user interface a little
better and I noted that it had obligingly imported my Navigator bookmarks
for me. On the other hand, Explorer isn't available on my Mac or on other
platforms yet. This is still a plus for Navigator.
</p><p>
Netscape's reaction is a mix of PR and legal maneuvering, with
accusations of illegal conduct strenuously denied by Microsoft in a
well-detailed response on their Web site. We'll see. In the meantime, the
war of the two browsers continues and it might take a very logical turn
in the next few months. Microsoft, on the one hand, wants to disable
Netscape's platform story. The solution? Integrate the browser into the
platform, instead of making it an application. Make it pervasive—make
it disappear. Explorer 4.0 might do just that, with a minuscule RAM
footprint (at least compared to the 4 to 5 megabytes currently required);
the rest of the code consists of DLLs inside the system.
</p><p>
More importantly, Explorer functions are instantiated as an API, allowing
programmers to integrate these functions into their code. The story
sounds good. Based on the progress thus far, the implementation ought to
be convincing. Netscape had the right idea, and here is our
implementation integrated in Windows 97. Netscape, on the other hand, has
decided to get into the operating system business with a subsidiary
called Navio. Reportedly, Navio will write an OS for televisions,
telephones and other communicating appliances. This OS will run a much
smaller version of Navigator. So now, Netscape is more or less trying to
do what Microsoft failed to execute with Modular Windows and Windows at
Work, two interesting stories for connoisseurs. We'll have to see what
Microsoft's reply to that one will be. A version of Pegasus, their
upcoming PDA OS, for appliances?
</p><p>
In the meantime, we happen to agree with Microsoft: the browser ought to
be integrated in the system and presented to application programmers as
an API, a class library. After all, several years ago, we didn't call our
