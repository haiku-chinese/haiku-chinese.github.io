Life was good from Winter to Spring and Summer to Fall. I was the lone
escapee from the weekly newsletter article. I wore pocket protectors,
kept a messy office, walked zigzag and backwards, and hid in small
corners for days just so I couldn't be found. I anticipated... I
planned... I executed.
</p><p>
But I forgot to turn off BeMail. "You have 1 new message." I didn't have
to look twice to know it was a message from Her. I tried to delete the
message, but I stumbled and deleted the apps folder instead. Panicking, I
hit the reset button and forced a rebuild of the database... just as She
was walking into my office. With my database nuked, I was sure I had
covered my tracks. But when my machine came up, the mail_deamon told a
different story: "There is 1 unread message." I was red-faced and caught
with the e-mail in my BeBox. I had no choice; I uncapped my pen and
pulled out my checkbook. But I didn't have enough in my checking account
to cover what She wanted.
</p><p>
So now it's time to do some writing on managing your source files on the
BeBox.
</p><p>
With the DR7 release, we started shipping the GNU source code control
utilities, called Revision Control System (RCS). We use these tools at Be
as a back-end for our source code control. The RCS tools let you store,
retrieve, merge, log changes, and identify revisions to your source
files. The commands to check out a file from RCS and to check it back in
again are as simple as
</p><pre class="screen">
ci <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em>
</pre><p>
and
</p><pre class="screen">
co <em class="replaceable"><code>filename</code></em>
</pre><p>
This method works well, but it can become cumbersome if you have multiple
directories or nested subdirectories. And beyond the usability issue,
there's also the fact that your working directory will be cluttered with
an equal number of RCS ",v" files.
</p><p>
The easiest way to get around these problems is to write a few Bash shell
scripts that can:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Pass the appropriate options to ci and co
</p></li><li><p>
Descend subdirectories to look for files to check in or out
</p></li><li><p>
Redirect the target RCS from current working directory to a
"mirrored" RCS repository directory
</p></li><li><p>
Create "missing" directories when you ask to check out a file
that's far down the RCS tree
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Through these scripts, you can tailor and reduce the complexity of
creating a simple source code control system on the BeBox.
</p><p>
There are a couple of gotchas currently in the BeBox that will make
writing and using these scripts not as straightforward as they could be.
One is that scripts are executed very slowly on the BeBox. This problem,
which is targeted to be fixed for DR9, can be traced to the way fork and
exec work.
</p><p>
The other major gotcha is that the file system doesn't check the write
permissions of a file. The danger in this is that you can check out a
file as read-only, yet still edit the file. Furthermore, while you will
be able to edit the file, RCS will not let you check it in as a revision.
The simple solution for this may be to just set up all files in RCS as
nonstrict, allowing check-in of files without locking.
</p><p>
At Be, we use many scripts and programs that cover the basic RCS tools.
</p><p>
I hope that this brief introduction to the RCS system, combined with the
RCS documentation in the /documentation/Shell Tools directory, will help
you create and tailor a source code control system for your project.

I'm a third year student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in Computer
Engineering. I first saw the BeBox while on an Internship with InterNex
Information Services in Santa Clara (practically neighbors!). I liked it
when I first saw it, and I still like it now. The idea of a computer
that's trying to learn from the mistakes of all the current platforms
sounded very interesting.
</p><p>
My two main interests have always been music and computers. It wasn't
until recently that I started to get into mixing the two, and even now I
see that the publicly available music software sucks—I hope to change
that. In addition to music, I'm also interested in networking.
(Networking and sound, now there's a combination.) The BeBox looks good
for the sound side of things: Real-time mixing, sampling, and sequencing.
</p><p>
When I look for a new computer, I first look at what's cheap. (Hey... I'm
a student. What can I say?) The BeBox looks like an excellent platform
for its price. It's also got the I/O that I want for my projects. The
<span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™ will make interfacing to drum pads a breeze, the MIDI ports
will make an obvious impact, and the 16-bit I/O is also a huge advantage.
And it all comes standard!!
</p><p>
From my one-person company, Halibut Computers, I run a bulletin board
service (Citadel UX). I'm thinking of porting it to the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™. I'm
also working on some sound remixing software for Linux. In general, I'm
interested in developing public domain software in the spirit of GNU. I'd
also like to share ideas with other Be developers that have interests
similar to mine. Anyone else willing (read: crazy enough) to shell out
the $1K to work on public domain sound and DSP stuff? If there are other
developers that are willing, I'd like see if we can't start working on
things together. It's better to not have to reinvent the wheel, brakes,
suspension, steering, and all the other standard options when trying to
build a sports car.

My column on the war of two browsers last week triggered the highest
volume of e-mail responses yet to my weekly essays. I must have
underestimated the heat of the browser war and the interest it generates.
Several readers pointed to an apparent omission: Microsoft has been
shipping a Mac version of Explorer 2.0 for a while and I failed to
mention it. This is true, the omission was intentional and poorly
presented. What I should have said is: At the 2.0 level, on the Mac or on
Windows, Internet Explorer could not compete with Navigator, its much
more complete feature set (news, mail, multiple simultaneous
downloads...), and much better execution. I appreciate the feedback and
the opportunity to clarify my position.
</p><p>
Speaking of clarity and position, I have to deal with the two "Wall
Street Journal" stories of August 29 and September 3. These stories
report rumors of conversations between Apple and our little company and
raise various possibilities, including an acquisition. I could pretend
the stories aren't there, but that wouldn't make them go away.
</p><p>
For the record, I can but confirm what I told "MacWeek" when they asked
about secret meetings at Macworld in Boston, following our presentation
of the BeOS port on a Power Computing Mac clone. Nothing of the sort took
place. The only conversation I had with an Apple executive, Heidi Roizen,
was about wines and lazy afternoons on barges floating down canals in
Burgundy. I shook hands with Ike Nassi when he passed by our booth and
took pictures of an Apple Fellow, Guy Kawasaki.
</p><p>
I also confirmed to "MacWeek" that I discussed technical cooperation with
Michael Spindler. I felt both parties might benefit, being part of the
PowerPC alliance. The first conversation took place in the Spring of
1994, as we were porting our system from the Hobbit to the PowerPC. The
second happened in February 1995. At the time, I was looking at the
whites of the repo man's eyes, we were running out of money, and I
offered Michael Spindler a financial transaction that would keep our
company afloat and provide Apple some insurance against delays or other
problems with Copland. Nothing came out of these discussions and, with
the usual but unfair 20/20 hindsight, it's probably for the best.
</p><p>
Instead of receiving assistance from Apple, we were helped by friendly
investors. My associate Jean Calmon and I lent funds to the company for a
while and, in April 1996, we raised $14 million (see our web site for
details), thus giving us the financial viability needed to develop our
business. When I write "for the best," I mean we enjoy a situation where
agendas are nicely aligned: Developers, investors, the team, everyone
agrees on what needs to be done. None of our investors, this includes all
Be employees, is in any hurry to unload shares. With alliances, different
cultures and goals are often hard to align, efficiency and agility tend
to suffer, and motivation can be hard to maintain. This seems to be the
sentiment on the net. Most people who comment on newsgroups advise us to
stay independent, for fear of losing the agility and focus that got us
where we are today.
</p><p>
We agree. We still have a lot to do and a lot to prove. DR8 is in
duplication and we're now focusing on DR9, the port to PowerMacs, and the
CD we'd like to sell out of our booth at the San Francisco Macworld in
January 1997.

AKA: Sound card discussion (or why my BeBox sounds better than my PC)<br />
AKA: Audio
</h5></div></div></div><p>
A reminiscence on Amiga turned into a discussion of what machine would
make the best multimedia kiosk box. Unsurprisingly, a number of Be
proponents were in the audience. The MM kiosk idea begat talk of the
advantages of built-in sound (versus sound cards).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id496883"></a>Subject: Filesystem Links</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Links: to SymLInk or not to SymLInk</h5></div></div></div><p>
Some discussion of how hard and soft links should be implemented in the
Be file system (and a bit of a UNIX and shell link tutorial). The
implied necessity of links was questioned: Some folks think that
record_refs obviate the need for links; others think that links are
needed, and the sooner the better.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id496904"></a>Subject: How are we suppose to do this?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Polling and redrawing; if you want smooth game animation, does the
application's redraw frequency need to exceed (or even equal) the
monitor's vertical blank rate? A short introduction to gaming terms
("physics rate,Ó "gfx rate") culminated in the blessing of 15 Hz as a
"good enough" redraw rate. Others differed, citing low rates as a cause
of "VR sickness;" some folks think that 15 Hz is simply too low given
that the brain can process 100 images a second.
</p><p>
Relatedly, should polling the user's input be faster than the redraw?
It was offered, not without objection, that it's pointless to poll
faster than you draw.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id496929"></a>Re: L2 cache and 603e (was: Be told me this ...)</h4></div></div></div><p>
Anticipation of the 133 MHz 603e spawned talk of performance
improvement; Dominic Giampaolo (of Be) posted some benchmarks. The lack
of an L2 cache was lamented, but, as one writer pointed out, the 66 MHz
603 doesn't have an L2, but it's zippy, nonetheless.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id496945"></a>Subject: X Windows for Gamekit</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Drawing in another app's window</h5></div></div></div><p>
Should Be support X? The X champions say "Why not?" The thread then
veered into a discussion of whether inter- application drawing should
be allowed, and how it should be implemented. Sending "draw it like
this" info in a BMessage to the remote app was suggested.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id496965"></a>Re: Honey, let's get Married!!!</h4></div></div></div><p>
This thread carries the file representation torch that proved too
scorching in previous incarnations (notably, the filename
case-insensitivity thread). Given here were theories on how the GUI and
the shell should display filenames, and how the two should interact.
For example, it was proposed that if you drop a file icon into a shell
window, the shell should display (as text) the file's name.
