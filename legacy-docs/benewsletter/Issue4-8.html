This adventure is more true than I might otherwise be willing to admit.
All persons and events depicted are entirely fictitious, except where
they aren't. Unflattering characterizations of certain organizations are
entirely deliberate and intentional.
</p><p>
You are in a cube. In front of you is a 16"
(visible) Sony monitor. In front of that is a
Mitsumi keyboard and an unbranded mouse. Just to
the right is a 266 MHz PC clone. The system is
running a development version of BeOS R4.
</p><p>
There is a graphics card here.<br />
There is a floppy disk here.<br />
There is a note from your boss here.<br />
There is a Hoberman sphere here.
</p><p>
&gt; INVENTORY
</p><p>
You have a well-used satchel. Inside it are
</p><p>
A set of screwdrivers<br />
A small telescope<br />
A 16M laptop RAM module<br />
A book on decorative knots<br />
A PCMCIA Ethernet card<br />
Last year's tax return<br />
A 166 MHz Pentium laptop computer<br />
A bottle of echinacea capsules<br />
Hair sticks
</p><p>
Your wallet contains $3200.
</p><p>
&gt; REPLACE KEYBOARD
</p><p>
You put aside the amazingly cruddy Mitsumi keyboard
and substitute your favorite AT&amp;T keyboard.
</p><p>
&gt; PUT LAPTOP ON DESK
</p><p>
The laptop is now on the desk.
</p><p>
&gt; READ NOTE
</p><p>
"Write a driver for this card. We'd like it in time
for R4 release."
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE GRAPHICS CARD
</p><p>
You are evidently the proud owner of a Yoyodyne
Monstra VelocElite-LX 128-3D-AGP graphics card.
</p><p>
&gt; INSERT CARD IN MACHINE
</p><p>
The machine emits a curious and worrying noise.
</p><p>
&gt; TURN OFF MACHINE AND INSERT CARD
</p><p>
The graphics card is now installed in the machine.
</p><p>
&gt; TURN ON MACHINE
</p><p>
BeOS R4(devel) boots. You are looking at a
gray scale desktop.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE FLOPPY DISK
</p><p>
The handwritten label reads, "Programming docs."
</p><p>
&gt; INSERT DISK AND PRINT DOCS
</p><p>
Nothing happens.
</p><p>
&gt; INSERT DISK, MOUNT DISK, AND PRINT DOCS
</p><p>
The drive spins for a moment, and the command prompt
returns.
</p><p>
&gt; READ DOCS
</p><p>
I see no docs here.
</p><p>
&gt; GO TO PRINTER AND GET DOCS
</p><p>
The printer is out of paper.
</p><p>
&gt; PUT PAPER IN PRINTER
</p><p>
There is no paper here.
</p><p>
&gt; STEAL PAPER FROM COPIER UPSTAIRS
</p><p>
After installing the liberated paper in the printer,
you print your docs.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE DOCS
</p><p>
The cover page reads, "Yoyodyne Monstra
VelocElite-LX 128-3D Programmer's Reference. Alpha
Revision 05-31-98. Confidential and Proprietary.
Restricted Secret; Level Violet. Do not expose in
public. This document must be kept secured when not
in use. Disclosure of this document to third
parties is punishable by death."
</p><p>
&gt; READ DOCS
</p><p>
After several hours, you finish reading the docs.
The VelocElite-LX is a depressingly predictable
variation on the VGA register set. There are some
registers that have unhelpfully terse descriptions.
The card also has the ability to execute rendering
command lists out of RAM.
</p><p>
You now know enough to write a rough driver for the
card.
</p><p>
&gt; WRITE ROUGH DRIVER
</p><p>
After several days, you have driver ready to test.
</p><p>
&gt; INSTALL DRIVER AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine.  The screen is blank.
</p><p>
&gt; RUN 'minicom' ON LAPTOP
</p><p>
The 'minicom' terminal emulator is now running in an
XTerm on the laptop.
</p><p>
&gt; PRESS ALT-SYSRQ ON MACHINE
</p><p>
Nothing happens.
</p><p>
&gt; PLUG SERIAL CABLE INTO LAPTOP
</p><p>
The "kdebug&gt;" prompt from the kernel debugger
appears on the XTerm.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE REGISTERS
</p><p>
After thirty minutes, you determine that two of the
sync registers are set incorrectly.
</p><p>
&gt; FIX BUGS IN DRIVER AND TEST
</p><p>
You can't see anything.
</p><p>
&gt; REBOOT IN SAFE MODE AND FIX BUGS
</p><p>
A new version of the driver is ready to test.
</p><p>
&gt; TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. You see a color BeOS
desktop.
</p><p>
&gt; TEST MODES
</p><p>
You switch to 800*600. It looks fine.<br />
You switch to 1024*768. It looks fine.<br />
You switch to 1152*864. There are pixel sparkles on
the screen.
</p><p>
&gt; PRESS ALT-SYSRQ ON MACHINE
</p><p>
</p><p>

&gt; YES, IT DOES!
</p><p>
Oh, sorry, I forgot. You get a "kdebug&gt;" prompt.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE SYNC REGISTERS
</p><p>
After forty minutes, you find nothing wrong with the
registers.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE REGISTER 0x6000
</p><p>
Register 0x6000 (FIFO watermarks) contains 0x0201
(powerup default).
</p><p>
&gt; WRITE 0x0200 TO REGISTER 0x6000
</p><p>
This is one of the poorly documented registers. Are
you sure you want to do this?
</p><p>
&gt; YES
</p><p>
The screen goes blank.
</p><p>
&gt; WRITE 0x0201 TO REGISTER 0x6000
</p><p>
You see a color BeOS desktop.
</p><p>
&gt; WRITE 0x0202 TO REGISTER 0x6000
</p><p>
The screen goes blank.
</p><p>
[ ...Many more iterations deleted... ]
</p><p>
&gt; WRITE 0x1810 TO REGISTER 0x6000
</p><p>
The pixel sparkles cease.
</p><p>
&gt; MODIFY DRIVER TO WRITE 0x1810 to 0x6000 AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. You see a color BeOS
desktop, sans pixel sparkles.
</p><p>
&gt; ADD HARDWARE BLITTER SUPPORT TO DRIVER AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. You see a perfectly stable
display of utter garbage with icons and text on top
of it.
</p><p>
&gt; FIX RECTANGLE CODE AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. You see a color BeOS desktop.
</p><p>
&gt; DRAG WINDOW
</p><p>
The screen turns blank.
</p><p>
&gt; FIX BLITTING CODE AND TEST
</p><p>
You can't see anything. If you proceed, you will
likely be eaten by a Grue.
</p><p>
&gt; REBOOT IN SAFE MODE, FIX BLITTING CODE, AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. A color BeOS desktop greets
you.
</p><p>
&gt; DRAG WINDOW
</p><p>
The window moves, but leaves "dirt" behind it.
</p><p>
&gt; READ DOCS ON BLITTER
</p><p>
"The blit width register is set to the number of
bytes copied per row." Your code reflects this
statement.
</p><p>
&gt; ADD FENCEPOST TO BLIT WIDTH AND TEST
</p><p>
You reboot the machine. Windows now drag normally,
except for some weirdness at the left edge of the
screen.
</p><p>
&gt; EXAMINE WEIRDNESS
</p><p>
It looks as if the left four columns of pixels are
being blitted 64 pixels too high.
</p><p>
&gt; READ DOCS ON BLITTER
</p><p>
There is nothing in the docs to explain this behavior.
</p><p>

AGP is an extension to PCI. Like a modern CPU's
MMU, AGP uses a translation table (called a GART) to
make disjoint blocks of system memory appear
contiguous. Both the graphics card and the
motherboard controller must be properly configured
for AGP to work. The layout and function of the PCI
AGP configuration registers are described only in
general terms. Most of the rest of the document
describes hardware implementation and signalling
details.

The <code class="filename">/dev/misc/config</code>
device acts as the middleman between the
configuration manager and user code. We've put together interface code
that handles all the messiness for you. Rather than commit any energy to
learning a one-shot interface, have faith and place your trust in these
routines. Everything you need to know about this glue code can be divined
from <code class="filename">cm_wrapper.h</code>.
</p><p>
The bulk of the first article concerned the mechanics of fetching
information from the configuration manager. Rather than repeat myself,
I'll spend time instead telling you how to make sense of this information.
</p><p>
The <span class="type">resource_descriptor</span> is the basic unit of configuration information,
describing an <acronym class="acronym">IRQ</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">DMA</acronym>,
I/O port, or memory used by a device. <acronym class="acronym">IRQ</acronym>s and
<acronym class="acronym">DMA</acronym>s are described by bitmasks, while I/O ports and memory are described
by ranges. A line of source is worth a thousand words:

A <span class="type">device_configuration</span> is an array of resource descriptors representing
the resources assigned to the device. Behold:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">print_device_configuration</code>(struct
  <span class="type">device_configuration</span> *<code class="parameter">config</code>)

  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code>;

    <code class="function">print_resource_descriptor</code>(<code class="parameter">config</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">resources</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>]);
}
</pre><p>
The final structure of interest is <span class="type">possible_device_configurations</span>,
representing the space of configurations a device can take. It is an
array of <span class="type">device_configurations</span>, with each element representing a set of
states the device can assume. Each <span class="type">resource_descriptor</span> in a
<span class="type">possible_device_configuration</span> represents a set of possible values for a
resource, rather than a single value, allowing for a compact description
of possible resource configurations for a device.
</p><p>
Since a device_configuration is a variable-sized structure, you can't
directly index the <span class="type">possible_device_configurations</span> to obtain a given
<span class="type">device_configuration</span>. You have to be more clever, but only just. As you
might expect:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

  }
}
</pre><p>
Each <span class="type">resource_descriptor</span> in a <span class="type">possible_device_configurations</span> may
represent a set of possible resources, so the lower level functions will,
sadly, need to be changed, leaving us with only the greasy middlemen,
<span class="type">print_device_configuration</span> and <span class="type">print_resource_descriptor</span>, unchanged. Some
parting words of advice:

This week I present unto you all a Media Node, specifically a
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>. The idea is simple: base your concept of time off
another time source, but publish a time that is off by some multiple. For
example, you could have a <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> that ran at double or half
the speed of some other time source. I'll use the node to go into some of
the basics of managing a standard Media Node, and a <code class="classname">BTimeSource</code> in
particular.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id543498"></a>Managing a Node</h3></div></div></div><p>
As mentioned in past articles, a node author needs to take care of a good
deal of node infrastructure. The main responsibilities are
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Allocation and release of a control port.
</p></li><li><p>
Servicing that control port.
</p></li><li><p>
Actual data processing.
</p></li><li><p>
A system to queue at least one of each of the basic node messages:
Start, Stop, and Seek.
</p></li></ul><p>
The allocation and deletion of the control port is straightforward, and
needs no explanation here. The system to queue service messages is also
generally easy. The <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> class contains a series of boolean
flags and <span class="type">bigtime_t</span> members that represent the service types and the time
the action is supposed to take place.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">/* from the class header */</span>
<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="varname">fStarting</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
<span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="varname">fStartTime</code> = 0;

<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">Start</code>(<span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="parameter">real_time</code>)
{
  <code class="varname">fStarting</code> = <code class="constant">true</code>;
  <code class="varname">fStartTime</code> = <code class="parameter">real_time</code>;
}
</pre><p>
When a start message comes in, the <code class="varname">fStarting</code> flag is set, and the time
the start is to occur is set. Similar work is done in the <code class="methodname">Stop()</code> and
<code class="methodname">Seek()</code> functions. This system allows the node to deal with one queued
action of each type, which can be overwritten by a subsequent message of
the same type.
</p><p>
The issue of thread management deserves a closer look. There are
currently two main schools of Node design: the single and dual thread
models. We're going to strongly recommend the single thread model, where
a single thread manages the main work of the thread and of servicing the
control port.
</p><p>
The main advantage of this system is that it uses fewer resources:
usually a thread and a semaphore less than a dual thread model (which has
a thread for servicing the control port and another for doing the real
work).
</p><p>
In general, the single thread model has a thread function that looks like
this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">RunService</code>()
{
  while (!<code class="varname">fTimeToQuit</code>) {

    <span class="comment">/* collect timing information */</span>
    <span class="comment">/* potentially do some work */</span>

    <span class="comment">/* Handle a queued Start */</span>
    if (!<code class="varname">fRunning</code> &amp;&amp; <code class="varname">fStarting</code>) {

    }

    <span class="comment">/* Handle a queued Stop */</span>
    if (<code class="varname">fRunning</code> &amp;&amp; <code class="varname">fStopping</code>) {

    }

    <span class="comment">/* Handle a Seek */</span>
    if (<code class="varname">fSeeking</code>) {

    }

    <span class="comment">/* Do Some Work */</span>
    if (<code class="varname">fRunning</code>) {

    }

    <span class="comment">/* Look for incoming messages */</span>
    <code class="function">read_port_etc</code>();
    <span class="comment">/* pass messages to superclasses */</span>
  }
}
</pre><p>
In the destructor, the <code class="varname">fTimeToQuit</code> flag is set
<code class="constant">true</code>, and you wait for the
thread to return before finishing the clean-up (including the deletion of
the control port).
</p><p>
The logic of the thread is to determine what time it is, handle any
queued event whose time has arrived (or will arrive very shortly), handle
the data processing that needs to be done by that point in time, and then
block in <code class="function">read_port_etc()</code> until it's time to handle the next event, or
until a message comes in that needs to be handled. The idea is to
establish the largest timeout possible while still managing to handle
events and do work in a timely fashion. As your main service thread will
likely be fairly high priority, you need to block when you don't want to
run. The <code class="function">read_port_etc()</code> call has the dual purpose of servicing the
control port and acting as a timer for the thread activity.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id543791"></a>A Responsible TimeSource</h3></div></div></div><p>
Looking specifically at a <code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>, the main work that needs to be
done is publishing its concept of time to the world. This is handled
through the appropriately named <code class="methodname">PublishTime()</code> function, which establishes
a relationship between performance time (as seen by the time source) and
real time (as seen by the system clock). It presents a known performance
time for a given real time, and a drift that describes the rate at which
these two times differ. As time is only published periodically (but at
least 20 times a second), the drift is used to approximate the
performance time for a given real time (and vice versa). The <code class="methodname">GetTime()</code>
function returns the information from the last call to PublishTime(), and
functions like <code class="methodname">PerformanceTimeFor()</code>,
<code class="methodname">RealTimeFor()</code>, and <code class="methodname">Now()</code> use that
last published time to return the correct approximation.
</p><p>
Time sources publish their time in microseconds, and the vast majority
have a drift centered around 1.0. This means time passes at roughly the
same speed as it does for the system clock, although it may be at some
offset if the time source was started later than the system clock (as is
likely). The drift of the time source will likely change somewhat as time
goes on, perhaps fluctuating over and around the 1.0 center.
</p><p>
It's important to understand this concept of drift before looking at a
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>'s concept of a rate. For
a <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>, time
passes at some multiple of another time source's concept of time. This
rate is fixed (at least until someone specifically changes it). A rate of
2.0 means that time passes for the <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> twice as fast as
the time source it's slaved to. Correspondingly, a rate of .25 means time
passes four times as slowly as the master's time. The drift that the
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> needs to publish is not fixed, however; it is the
product of the Master drift and the internal rate. For example, if a
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> with a rate of 2.0 is slaved to a master with a
current drift of .9, the published drift of the <code class="classname">VTS</code> would be 1.8.
</p><p>
The master of a <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> is set like that of any other node,
through the <code class="methodname">SetTimeSource()</code> function. It is created with a default rate,
which can be examined through the <code class="methodname">Rate()</code> function, and changed through
the <code class="methodname">SetRate()</code> function. The published drift can be examined in the same
manner as any other <code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>, through the <code class="methodname">GetTime()</code> function. (As an
aside, you can slave one <code class="classname">VTS</code> to another, and everything works fine.)
</p><p>
Another useful function is <code class="methodname">SyncToMaster()</code>. If called before the
<code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> has been started, it makes sure that the first
published time matches the performance time of the master time source
when the <code class="classname">VTS</code> starts. Any time afterwards, it causes the time source to
conform to the last published performance time of the master. This is
implemented in terms of a <code class="methodname">Seek()</code> operation to the appropriate master time.
</p><p>
I'm sure you'll find plenty of uses for the <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code>. Some of
the potential uses we've discovered internally include: running a node
without <code class="constant">B_OFFLINE</code> capabilities at higher speeds to decrease export time
to a file; having a node run considerably slower so that debug
information can be viewed as it changed; and slaving a <code class="classname">VTS</code> to a sound
card's time source so it can stop, start, and seek without affecting
other applications.
</p><p>
You'll see improvements in the <code class="classname">VariableTimeSource</code> in the future,
including the implementation of the <code class="classname">BControllable</code> interface so the rate
can be changed from other applications. I've also been threatened with
the possibility that it will become an official Media Kit class at some
point in the future.
</p><p>
In any case, take a look at the class and the supporting application so
you can see it in action. If you find bugs or have questions, send them
in and I'll try to answer them. You can find the sample project at:

You're the <acronym class="acronym" title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</acronym>
of a PC OEM, delivering some great news to Wall Street:
"In an effort to offer greater variety and performance to the customer,
our factory now installs three operating systems on the hard disk --
Windows, Linux, and the BeOS. The reaction has been spectacular.
Customers love having a choice of OS, and the press—from John Dvorak
in PC Magazine to John Markoff in the New York Times to Walt Mossberg in
the Wall Street Journal—has heralded us for our bold move. This is a
great step forward for the consumer and for the industry. Oh, and by the
way, we lost $50 million since we no longer qualify for Windows rebates.
But it's a sacrifice for the common good."
</p><p>
You're now the ex-CEO of a PC OEM.
</p><p>
We know that the Windows rebate scheme exists—but what *is* it,
exactly? And why are so many OEMs afraid of losing it? Windows pricing
practices are closely guarded secrets, so we don't know exactly how the
rebate is structured, but we can assume that it works something like
this: The total cost of a Windows license consists of a base price offset
by a rebate. The base price is set; the rebate is flexible, and
contingent on the "dedication" of the licensee. That is, the more you
"advertise" the product—through prominent positioning, expanded shelf
space, and so on—the greater your rebate. This quid pro quo rebate
looks innocent enough, and can be a useful tool in a competitive market.
</p><p>
But when you're running a monopoly—and when it comes to
out-of-the-box, consumer-grade PC clones, Microsoft *is* a monopoly --
"prominent positioning" and "expanded shelf space" have little meaning.
Microsoft has no interest in getting "more" footage on the OS shelf,
because they've already got it all. What interests them—the only
useful advantage they can "buy" (to be kind) with their rebate—is to
ensure that no one else will get any.
</p><p>
So how is "dedication" measured? A real-life example: We've been working
with a PC OEM that graciously—and bravely—decided to load the BeOS
on certain configurations in its product line. However, there's a twist
in their definition of "loading." When the customer takes the machine
home and starts it up for the first time, the Microsoft boot manager
appears—but the BeOS is nowhere in sight. It seems the OEM interpreted
Microsoft's licensing provisions to mean that the boot manager could not
be modified to display non-Microsoft systems. Furthermore, the icon for
the BeOS launcher—a program that lets the user shut down Windows and
launch the BeOS—doesn't appear on the Windows desktop; again, the
license agreement prohibits the display of "unapproved" icons. To boot
the "loaded" BeOS, the customer must read the documentation, fish a
floppy from the box and finish the installation. Clever.
</p><p>
One suspects that Linux suffers from the same fealty to Microsoft's
licensing strictures. Linux is the culmination of 30 years of development
by the Unix community. Surely an OEM can't complain about Linux's quality
or its price: It's good, and it's free. If Microsoft licensees are as
free to choose as Microsoft claims they are, why isn't Linux factory
installed on *any* PC? If you randomly purchase 1,000 PC clones, how many
have any OS other than Windows loaded at the factory? Zero.
</p><p>
But what about all these announcements from companies such as IBM, Dell,
and others? A few URLs are supplied here for your convenience:
</p><p>
http://www.dell.com/products/workstat/ISV/linux.htm<br />
http://www.compaq.com/isp/news_events/index.html<br />

http://www.hp.com/pressrel/jan99/27jan99b.htm<br />
http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2/linux/
</p><p>
If you parse the statements, Linux is offered and supported on servers,
not on PCs. Another IBM story is that installation is to be performed by
the reseller on some PCs or laptops, not by IBM at the factory.
</p><p>
As an industry insider gently explained to me, Microsoft abides by a very
simple principle: No cracks in the wall. Otherwise, water will seep in
and sooner or later the masonry will crumble.
</p><p>
Guarding against even the smallest crack is important to Microsoft,
because it prevents a competitor from taking advantage of a phenomenon
that economists call the "network effect." The "network effect" manifests
itself as an exponential increase in the value of a product or service
when more people use it. Applied to a computer operating system, the
effect works like this: As more people install and use an OS, the demand
for applications increases. Developers respond to the demand, which
attracts the attention of OEMs and resellers, who promote the OS in order
to sell the apps, which attracts more customers... The key to all this is
distribution and visibility—in other words, "shelf space."
</p><p>
Bill Gates understands the network effect well—he once quoted it to
me, chapter and verse. In the Fall of 1983, when I was still running
Apple France, I met with Bill in Paris and we got into a conversation
regarding the market share limitations of DOS. No problem, he said, with
the wide distribution we enjoy, we'll get the attention of third parties,
and the marketplace will fix these shortcomings.
</p><p>
This puts statements by senior Microsoft executive Paul Maritz in
perspective. In reaction to my claim that Be wants to co-exist with
Microsoft, Mr. Maritz said (as quoted by Joseph Nocera in Fortune
Magazine):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
"[Gassee is] articulating his strategy for entry into the
operating system marketplace. But on the other hand, I
know that Be has built a full-featured operating system,
so what I believe he's doing here is outlining his
strategy about how he will initially co-exist with Windows
and, over time, attract more applications to his
platform."
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Mr. Nocera interpreted Mr. Maritz's interpretation thus:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
"In other words, Gassee's spiel is little more than a
trick intended to lull Microsoft. But Microsoft isn't so
easily fooled! Microsoft will never ignore a potential
threat to its Windows fortress, no matter how slight. The
software giant may be in the middle of an antitrust trial,
but—as Andy Grove says—only the paranoid survive..."
</p></blockquote></div><p>

</p><p>
Industry sages such as T.J. Rodgers, the CEO of Cypress Semiconductors,
as well as venture capitalists aligned with Microsoft, criticize the
Department of Justice's intervention in the new Pax Romana we're supposed
to enjoy under Microsoft's tutelage. Don't compete in court, compete in
the marketplace, they say.
</p><p>
I'm a free marketer myself; I left a statist environment for the level
playing field created by the rule of law in this, my adopted country. A
free market is *exactly* what we want. One where a PC OEM isn't
threatened by financial death for daring to offer operating systems that
compete with the Windows monopoly.
