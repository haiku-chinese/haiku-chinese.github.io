one lonely class, the <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>. This class has two main purposes:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>It provides a clean API for getting direct access to a graphics card
frame buffer (in full-screen mode).
</p></li><li><p>It provides a simple means for switching between <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code> and
"normal" application workspaces.
</p></li></ul><p>(As a bonus, the class can use multiple buffers and also lets you get at
most of the accelerated functions of the graphics card add-ons—the
blit is usually quite interesting.)
</p><p>As we all know, one of the stanchions of the BeOS is its
multiprocessor/multithreaded design. I hope there are already many
creative developers busily working on full- screen, multithreaded games
using the GameKit. To transform this hope into reality, I thought I would
describe a typical multithreaded game architecture—perhaps this will
help some of you find your marks.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id506920"></a>How Shall We Thread?</h3></div></div></div><p>To figure out how many threads we need, and what each will be doing, we
need to break the game into its various disciplines:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>At the highest level, we have to get the user input and translate it
into an interaction with the program (the game proper, and its menus).
</p></li><li><p>We have to provide some general game management: Moving the monster,
detecting collisions, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>We have to provide three-dimensional graphic preprocessing. This
includes figuring out which objects are visible, which ones are closest
to the "camera," calculating the perspective, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>Once we've performed our preprocessing, we have to actually render
the scene—we have to do some drawing (texture mapping, mainly).
</p></li><li><p>Finally, there are the bells and whistles—literally. For what's a
game without music and sound effects?
</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, let's look at the timing requirements and CPU intensity of these
tasks:
</p><p>(A), (B), and (C) are very closely linked (logically) and use
considerably less CPU than (D), so it's reasonable to keep these three
tasks in the same thread.
</p><p>(D) is extremely CPU intensive—it can be interesting to try to break
it into many pieces.
</p><p>(E) *must* stay in real time—sound must never stand still. Therefore,
it should get its own thread.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id506995"></a>The Four-Thread Model</h3></div></div></div><p>Using the Innerstrike game as an example, we can distribute these tasks
across four threads (plus one):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>The "game controller" thread covers tasks (A), (B), and (C): It gets
input from the user and does all the 3D geometry (but not the
rendering). This thread takes 30% to 50% of one of the CPUs.
</p></li><li><p>The music and sound mixer thread (E) plays four tracks of music and
mixes in individual sound effects. It takes a small chunk of one CPU.
</p></li><li><p>Two "graphic server" threads (D) do the rendering. They operate from
a list of "rendering orders" as they draw to and from the frame buffer
(or off-screen window). The first server is responsible for drawing the
"common" interface and everything generated by player one; the second
thread is responsible for player two. These threads pretty much eat up
whatever cycles are left (on both CPUs).
</p></li></ul><p>(The "plus one" thread mentioned above is the default <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>
window thread, which provides the interface to the App Server; this
thread takes almost no CPU time and isn't really part of the architecture
of the game.)
</p><p>Note that if the game is being played in single-player mode, only one
server thread is used. Thus, in this mode, a dual- CPU machine isn't used
to its full potential. But I decided that for Innerstrike, splitting the
rendering of a single view into two threads (to take advantage of both
CPUs, regardless of the number of players) was too much trouble, and may
have produced unreliable results.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id507059"></a>The Master/Slave Relationship</h3></div></div></div><p>If we look at the most important parts of Innerstrike, we see that the
game controller thread (the "master") controls the two graphic server
threads (the "slaves"). The master communicates with its slaves through
two multibuffer channels. Each channel is protected by two semaphores:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p><code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code> indicates how many buffers are ready to be filled (by
the master) with rendering orders.
</p></li><li><p><code class="varname">BUFFER_WAITING</code> indicates how many buffers are waiting to be rendered
by the slaves.
</p></li></ul><p>The buffers are always used in the same order, so we don't need an
explicit list of empty (or waiting) buffers—we just need to know which
one is the next. So each channel also has two indices,
<code class="varname">CURRENT_EMPTY_BUFFER</code> and <code class="varname">CURRENT_WAITING_BUFFER</code>.
</p><p>Each time the master wants to send rendering orders to a slave, it asks
the specific channel for a new empty buffer by acquiring the BUFFER_EMPTY
semaphore. When a buffer becomes available, the master fills it and
releases the <code class="varname">BUFFER_WAITING</code> semaphore, and then increments (modulo the
number of buffers in the channel) the <code class="varname">CURRENT_EMPTY_BUFFER</code> index.
</p><p>The slave side is even simpler. A slave tries to get new rendering orders
by acquiring the <code class="varname">BUFFER_WAITING</code> semaphore. When the buffer becomes
available, the slave executes the orders in the buffer and then releases
the <code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code> semaphore and increments the
<code class="varname">CURRENT_WAITING_BUFFER</code>
index. Then it starts all over again.
</p><p>Here's a generic implementation (potentially not bug free!):

}
</pre><p>Since semaphores, context switching, and memory allocation aren't free, I
recommend that you use a small number of big buffers. In Innerstrike I
use a <code class="varname">BUFFER_COUNT</code> of 2, enough to have the master working on the next
frame as the slaves are drawing the previous one. Using more than two
buffers increases the game's latency (the delay between the user's action
and the reaction on-screen) without any real speed improvement.
</p><p>With regard to the size of the buffers, I allocate enough memory (per
buffer) to store the full description of a single frame. However, you
don't have to be so precise. You can allocate significantly larger
buffers without worrying about the entire buffer being swapped into
physical memory: Individual pages are loaded into RAM *only* as they are
touched.
</p><p>To avoid paging as the game starts running, you should walk through your
buffers (as your application is launching) and touch the first few pages
that you know you will be using. Here, again, you don't have to be
terribly precise—if your game eats up more pages as it's running, keep
in mind that the master will touch these pages before the slaves get to
them, so the delay incurred by swapping the pages in will be partly
absorbed by the latency of the game (since the master is running at least
one frame ahead of the slaves).

<code class="methodname">ScreenConnected()</code> function
(which toggles the game's access to the screen) is trivial. Just make
sure that...
</p><p>...nobody accesses the frame buffer before a
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">TRUE</code></code>) or
after a
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">FALSE</code></code>).
</p><p>...the game does nothing while the screen is disconnected.
</p><p>...you update the frame buffer description each time
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">TRUE</code>)</code>
is called, and make sure nobody uses a value that's
not up to date.
</p><p>Following these rules shouldn't present any problems. We just need to get
control of all the buffers in both channels to be sure that...
</p><p>...the slaves aren't operating on the buffers and there aren't any old
buffers left.
</p><p>...the master isn't using the current value of the frame_buffer
description, since it doesn't own any buffers (the master is supposed to
use the frame_buffer description only to describe rendering orders in a
buffer).
</p><p>So here's a generic implementation of <code class="methodname">ScreenConnected()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>::<code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">active</code>)
{
  <span class="type">int</span>   <code class="varname">i</code>;

  if (!<code class="parameter">active</code>) {
    for (<code class="varname">i</code>=0;<code class="varname">i</code>&lt;<code class="constant">BUFFER_COUNT</code>;<code class="varname">i</code>++) {
      <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code>[0]);
      <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code>[1]);
    }

    { <span class="comment">/* optional: save the frame_buffer */</span> }
  }
  else {
    { <span class="comment">/* optional: restore the frame_buffer */</span> }

    { <span class="comment">/* Get a new description of the frame_buffer /*</span> };
    for (<code class="varname">i</code>=0;<code class="varname">i</code>&lt;<code class="constant">BUFFER_COUNT</code>;i++) {
      <code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code>[0]);
      <code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code>[1]);
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>Now you should understand why we initialized the semaphores to 0—the
first
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">TRUE</code>)</code>
will release all the buffers and start the
game running. Just be careful to create all the semaphores before the
<code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>, as there's currently a race condition bug in the Game Kit
between the completion of the <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code> constructor and the first
call to
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">TRUE</code>)</code>.
(This bug should be fixed in DR9).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id507714"></a>Some Closing Remarks</h3></div></div></div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Using a double buffer between the master and the slaves (between the
controller and the renderer) *does* increase the game's latency. You
might assume that the game will, therefore, feel slow and unresponsive.
But this isn't really the case. The delay between the user's decision
to act, and the delivery of the event to the computer is *already*
significant: All the way from the brain's decision, through the nerves,
then the activation of the muscle, and the move itself (let's say with
a joystick). This is a long time from the computer's point of view --
usually more than one second. Adding a twentieth of a second (the
typical cost of the double buffer) isn't all that significant—the
user will never feel it.
</p><p>If a user feels that a game is sluggish, it's probably because the game
isn't generating enough frames per second—the brain is extremely
sensitive to this rate—or because the input device/driver is slow or
insensitive.
</p></li><li><p>Each time you give up control of the screen (through
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">ScreenConnected</code>(<code class="constant">FALSE</code>)</code>),
the frame buffer will be reset and
reconfigured for another application (or the application server). When
you get control back, you may need to restore your previous frame
buffer content (everything else is managed by the Game Kit).
</p><p>In the above sample, I suggest a very simple solution: Explicitly save
and restore the frame buffer. In most cases, you can redraw the full
screen just by calling a "refresh_screen" function, which you can
implement to redraw everything from scratch (this is what I do in the
Dominos sample application).
</p></li><li><p>The speed of the communication between the master and its slaves
depends on the amount of data you're sending: To make this as fast as
possible, you should try to pass as little data as possible. For
example, the Innerstrike game stores all the texture maps in a shared
area, so only a pointer to them needs to be passed.
</p><p>Also, Innerstrike allows many faces to share the same texture map
descriptor. So you can say "I want to map my texture onto *this*
projection...," and then say "...and apply it to all *these* faces."
</p><p>You might also try reducing the number of vertices by using big faces
(I use up to 6 points in Innerstrike), or by using triangle- and
quadrangle-faced strips.
</p></li><li><p>It's usually easier to debug your program if you can put it in
"single thread" mode. If you look at the previous sample, you'll see I
always write only in one buffer of any channel at a time. Thus I can
store the currently used buffer descriptor in a global variable, and so
easily switch between direct calls and the buffered multithreaded
architecture. To do this, you just need a few C-macros (or inline C++
functions):
</p><p>-&gt; <code class="function">OpenChannel</code>(<code class="parameter">channel_index</code>); -&gt;
<code class="function">CloseChannel</code>(<code class="parameter">channel_index</code>); -&gt;
<code class="function">RenderingOrder</code>(<code class="parameter">my_parameters</code>); <span class="comment">// one macro for each distinct rendering</span>
order
</p><p>In "direct" mode, you just map <code class="function">OpenChannel</code>() and <code class="function">CloseChannel</code>() to
nothing ( <code class="code">{;}</code> for example) and call the <code class="function">RenderingOrder</code>() functions
directly.
</p><p>In buffered mode, you map <code class="function">OpenChannel</code>() and <code class="function">CloseChannel</code>() to...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">OpenChannel</code>(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">index</code>)
{
  <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_EMPTY</code>[<code class="parameter">index</code>]);

  { <span class="comment">/* set the global buffer to the buffer indexed by
    * CURRENT_EMPTY_BUFFER[index]
    */</span>
  }
}

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">CloseChannel</code>(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">index</code>)
{
  <code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">BUFFER_WAITING</code>[<code class="parameter">index</code>]);
  <code class="varname">CURRENT_EMPTY_BUFFER</code>[<code class="parameter">index</code>] =
    (<code class="varname">CURRENT_EMPTY_BUFFER</code>[<code class="parameter">index</code>]+1) % <code class="constant">BUFFER_COUNT</code>;
}
</pre><p>...and then map all your <code class="function">RenderingOrder()</code> macros to a function that
simply pushes the ID of the desired rendering order (and its
parameters) into the current global buffer. When the slave receives the
buffer, it gets the rendering order ID and reads the parameters. This
leaves the problem of actually invoking the rendering order: A simple
method is to use a <code class="code">switch()</code> based on the order ID. If you're really
clever, you can pretend the buffer is a stack, push a function pointer
and parameters onto this pseudo-stack, and then "execute" it. Fast --
but not terribly portable. By enabling or disabling your function
mappings, you can switch between a straightforward single-threaded
implementation (the code generated in that case will not include
anything useless) and your multithreaded one. This is definitely useful
for debugging and testing.

Can you believe it: "Hey honey, look... They
actually pay me to have this much fun!"
</p><p>That's what I was saying to my wife last week, to which she responded,
"I'm glad they pay you to play dear, can you take out the trash." And,
"If you can teach developers to cook, why can't you fix dinner?"
</p><p>Anyway. Last week we had our first developer's kitchen. As far as I'm
concerned it was a success. It was a small showing, but allowed us to
work out a process. One of our new developers was so excited they decided
to stay through this week to get their whole product ported! Once this is
done, I'll share it with you all because it's pretty exciting.
</p><p>One thing that small ventures must rely heavily on is the enthusiasm of
their community. It's the collective knowledge and experience of these
enthusiasts that make our platform interesting and the production of
killer apps possible. We don't stand alone in our efforts. You would all
be proud to sit in on one of our developer discussions and hear Steve
Horowitz say "What do you guys want to see in the next release?" and
actually work towards producing it. Or "I'll have that feature in there
before you leave the building." This dedication from our engineers simply
isn't found everywhere.
</p><p>All great things are built by collectives. Even when there is a striking
advancement, such as anything Nikola Tesla invented, they're built from
standing atop strong principles and past actions. This week I am proud to
hatch upon the Be community such an effort.
</p><p>Before joining Be I hacked at a QuickCam driver. I released it
unceremoniously upon the world without real support or comment. Well last
week I gave my camera and driver to George (our OpenGL® porting intern).
Understand this, George is a good programmer, he programs a lot... I
mean... he actually lives in his cubicle. By the way, OpenGL® is looking
quite fine, he did a very good job. Anyway, he made short work of my
driver and fixed a couple of bugs that I had left for him to find. The
result: We have a /dev/quickcam that works for the BeOS! You just put the
qcam file in your /boot/system/drivers directory and fire up the QCamView
application and suddenly you're watching yourself on the screen! This
only works with the grayscale camera plugged into the parallel port. I
think it only works with DR8.2, so if you haven't upgraded, you should.

</p><p>Is this something to get excited about? For certain people it is. We now
have a ready source of live media to play with. I would expect a
videophone any day now, perhaps as a networking tutorial? Other than
being a ready source for information on how to write a device driver,
this code also shows that a lot of work can be done quickly when done by
a collective. I started the driver, George finished it and wrote the
viewer. Some other developer will pick up the ball and we'll have
videophone and MPEG recording. Someone else will make an acquisition
module for their video editing suite and we'll be cooking with gas!
</p><p>This type of work is what excites me about being at Be. Individuals
making small contributions will have their efforts amplified into major
works of engineering. I don't want to praise the collective too much
though. Hard working individuals with a fire in the belly to make their
dreams come true are what fuel most innovations. And as we say,
"Resistance Is Not Futile!"

"Sure, here it is... Oh you meant for DR9?"
</p><p>So, this week's source is a modified version of the Pulse application.
It's a little cleaned up and will work with one or two processors in the

it's visually the same as what comes with the machine.

</p><p>Speaking of resource viewers such as Pulse, BeZap does an excellent job
of not just showing system resources, but acting as a thread/team manager
as well. It looks like wherever the BeOS has left a hole, developers have
rushed in with very good alternatives. I really like this tool. It makes
killing off those errant processes that much easier. Make sure you look
at the about box animation as well.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508126"></a>Cheerleading</h3></div></div></div><p>Macworld is rapidly approaching. So it's time for me to start acting like
a cheerleader. There are no logistics to make available yet, but I want
to start pounding the drum early to get developers to think of what
they'll want to show at Macworld. We would prefer our booth to be filled
with applications written by our developers, not by us. So start thinking
about polishing that killer app by Macworld time. If you're ready to go,
then we'll be ready to show! Over the next few weeks I'll pound the drum
louder and louder until it's so deafening you can do nothing but complete
those apps and help us show off your wares.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing1-50"></a>Be Marketing Mutterings: So, What'S Next?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Alex</span> <span class="surname">Osadzinski</span></span></div></div></div><p>I need hardly say that it's quite an exciting time at Be. So exciting
actually, that we might be forgiven a little euphoria, and one could even
speculate that we're all thumping each other soundly on the back
proclaiming that the BeOS' future is assured.
</p><p>That would be a mistake, and our backs remain unthumped at this time.
</p><p>It's wonderful to be receiving so much attention for the company and its
products. We're particularly encouraged by detailed product reviews, such
as the one gracing the cover of January's MacUser magazine. And although,
to paraphrase our fearless CEO, all rumors are UNtrue, it's also nice to
see our company's name linked with one of the giants of the computer
industry. If you're a Mac user or developer, the chances are that you've
read about us in the press recently. If you're not (and, we never forget,
half our developers are not Mac people, and just as valuable to us as the
half that are), there's still a chance that you've heard the brouhaha
surrounding Be these past few weeks.
</p><p>But let's get real. Our corporate foot continues to mash the pedal
thoroughly to the metal in pursuit of our continuing goal: To make the
BeOS successful in its target markets by making it the platform of choice
for applications written by our developers. It's been said many times
before, but I make no apologies for saying it again: We will succeed only
if we make it possible for our application developers to ship profitable,
successful, useful products on the BeOS. Those products need to be easier
to develop and maintain and more stable, more functional, faster, or
simply better than applications on other platforms.
</p><p>New operating systems take a while to get established. Developers want a
high-volume platform, and volume is driven by applications. Priming this
circle takes time, money, and determination. The early developers take a
higher risk, with potentially higher reward. We're working hard to
generate significant volume for the BeOS in 1997; watch our web site for
announcements. If you've followed Be for a while, you'll have come to
expect a few curveballs now and again, and we'd like to continue to
surprise you occasionally.
</p><p>So, what do we REALLY think will happen next? The answer is simple: The
snowball that we're pushing down the hill isn't big enough yet to roll on
its own. 1997 is the year when we expect to give it a big enough push
that it will begin to gather its own momentum. Our goals for market share
are modest: We would rather be doing excellently a few things, such as
digital content design, than try to become a replacement, or new,
general-purpose operating environment. Our plans are to continue to
enhance the product, to ship it in volume on PowerMac platforms, and to
help and encourage our developers to generate applications that a
targeted set of end users will want to buy (rather than just download for
free). Past experience with new computer platforms has taught me that the
only useful strategy is to stay the course; progress that one day seems
slow has a habit of suddenly accelerating, and it's all based on the
availability of a few early applications. Check out the BeWare section of
our web site; if you've been following it for a while, you'll have seen
it grow from a few interesting demo, to applets, to now a few genuinely
useful applications. The snowball just gained some mass.

Comdex certainly
provided an opportunity for one: The rebirth of the PDA category. From
Casio to Compaq, NEC to Hitachi and Philips, Windows CE devices were
everywhere. Nice, light, small (HP 200 LX palmtop size), functional,
well-connected to the web, well-integrated with your favorite Windows
desktop, supported by "90 developers worldwide," the new HPC (hand-held
PC) standard seems like a potential winner. I only write "potential"
because I haven't purchased and used one—yet. For a while, the
category had been given up for if not dead at least fractured, small, and
not really interesting. HP was selling the LX and the Omnigo, Sharp their
Zaurus, Psion their Series 3. Only Sharp was really spending marketing
dollars, the other brands relying mostly on word of mouth.
</p><p>That state of affairs changed with the Pilot. Palm Computing had a false
start with their previous pen-based PDA sold by Sharp and Casio. They
regrouped, provided a solid financial foundation by selling the company
to US Robotics, and came out with a smaller device: It fits easily in a
shirt pocket and is much better synchronized to your PC. The latter
meaning the Pilot integrated really well with your Windows desktop (and
your Mac Real Soon Now), it automatically updated appointments and other
data files. Donna Dubinsky, Palm Computing's CEO, used both the armored
infantry divisions provided by the adopting company and the guerrilla
tactics of a start-up. US Robotics provided the low-cost manufacturing
and the aggressive marketing and distribution that enabled US Robotics to
dominate the modem market. And at the Agenda industry conference last
month in Phoenix, Donna had the mothers of the founders peddle Pilots to
startled industry executives. The point: So easy to use your mother would
love it. It worked. First, because the product is really pleasant to use.
And second, it gave a personal object a very personal touch.
</p><p>Now the game has changed again. By all accounts, the infantry divisions
under Microsoft's command have successfully created a new standard. At
the risk of repeating some Erich Ringewald's comments in his column last
week, Microsoft earned that market by learning from others and from its
mistakes and finally delivering a good execution of the
PDA-as-a-companion-to-your-PC concept. After fiascoes such as PenWindows
and WinPad and observing the travails of Go, General Magic, and the
Newton, Microsoft really did their homework. When I received a detailed
e-mail questionnaire from Microsoft inquiring about the daily uses of my
Psion, I responded with two questions: How did they find me, and what was
in it for me in helping them compete against Psion? Their answer to the
first question was clear: They monitored the Psion newsgroup. As for the
second question, they seemed puzzled. I let go of the thread and of the
questionnaire.
</p><p>With Windows CE on the scene, if a third-party hardware or software
vendor thinks of entering the PDA or HPC market, which platform will they
support? There is only one product line meeting the platform definition.
</p><p>The beauty of the situation is breathtaking. Consider some of the larger
companies on the planet: NEC, Hitachi, who supplied the SH RISC processor
for these devices—this is not a Wintel product—as well as their own
HPCs, Philips, Compaq... These companies are sweating the capital
investments to make and distribute these miniaturized devices. And
Microsoft is getting royalties on the software and will sell applications
on both sides of the PC-HPC connection. One HPC per PC user, that's all
they ask.
</p><p>Does this mean "game over" for the other products? If they're too close
in features, size, and price to the CE devices, the long-term prospects
aren't too good, especially with Microsoft supplying both Windows and
Windows CE and therefore being able to parlay various aspects of the
resulting better integration into competitive advantages.
</p><p>The Pilot is a good example of a product different enough. Unlike the CE
devices, it doesn't have a keyboard and it connects more easily to the PC
thanks to a nicely deigned cradle. It's smaller, more focused in its
applications than the more general-purpose HPC, and it's less expensive
by several hundred dollars. We'll see what HP does with its LX family.
</p><p>We should be thankful for a few reminders from Microsoft. Don't play
where they master both sides of an interface or a transaction. Initial
success, or failure, doesn't mean much; relentless pursuit and execution
of an idea does.

</h5></div></div></div><p>The debate over whether Be should settle on a single scripting language
(or scripting interface) continues. This week's new angle: Scripting is
really only interesting when more than one application is involved
(this includes bidirectional communication), thus there MUST be a
common language or interface layer.
</p><p>Perpendicularly, the content of the "common interface layer" was
discussed. One correspondent argued that Be shouldn't define the
messages that are delivered between apps, it should only define how the
messages are delivered.
</p><p>The thread also discussed the issue of third-party competition: How far
should Be go with its "scripting solution" before it unfairly competes
with its own developers?
</p><p>In related threads, the various scripting languages were described.

score so far: Everyone pretty much hates messy overlapping windows --
anything that can improve this fact of life is appreciated. 3D,
obviously, holds promise in this area, but most correspondents are a
bit skeptical of the intuitiveness of a full 3D workspace. The provicts
argue that we live in a 3D world, so intuition should be on the side of
a 3D GUI; convicts grant this point, but then score a right to the jaw
