The kernel team is planning to document several aspects of kernel-level
programming in a series of Newsletter articles. This will be useful to
anyone who ever intends to write or directly use a driver, and will also
be of general interest to those who are simply interested in knowing how
the pieces of the kernel fit together.
</p><p>
This article provides an overview of the entire series. Future articles
will focus on the various components a developer can contribute—user-
and kernel-level drivers, modules, bus managers, busses, etc., and will
contain helpful suggestions as to how to properly and safely integrate
these pieces into the system.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id787699"></a>Introduction</h3></div></div></div><p>
As most of you know, the BeOS kernel itself consists only of core
functionality, sufficient to start the boot process and manage memory and
threads. Also built into the kernel are the ISA bus manager, the PCI bus
manager, the device file system (devfs) which manages
<code class="filename">/dev</code>, the root file
system (rootfs) which handles things in
<code class="filename">/</code>, and a few other odds and ends.
</p><p>
Since this is nowhere near enough to do anything useful, as early as the
boot process the kernel uses add-ons to extend its functionality. File
systems, device and bus drivers, for example, are all add-ons that are
loaded by the kernel.
</p><p>
These kernel add-ons can be broadly classified into three categories:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
device drivers—code that communicates directly with a device
</p></li><li><p>
modules—add-ons that export an API for use by other modules or
drivers, all within kernel space
</p></li><li><p>
file systems—BFS, dosfs, hfs, etc. These will not be covered in
this series.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Device drivers and file systems, while they add functionality to the
kernel, are accessible from user space, in the sense that you can open
them and address them via file descriptors. Modules, however, are
kernel-only extensions, since they provide functionality for drivers and
other modules. The raison d'etre of modules will become clearer below.
</p><p>
Note: some of this has been covered before in some detail in an article
by Arve Hjønnevåg. See "<a class="xref" href="Issue3-20.html#Engineering3-20" title="Be Engineering Insights: Splitting Device Drivers and Bus Managers">Be Engineering Insights: Splitting Device Drivers and Bus Managers</a>".
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id787781"></a>What exactly is a device driver?</h3></div></div></div><p>
A device driver is something that actually talks to a specific device or
class of devices. The communication usually involves some device-specific
protocol—for example, code that specifically addresses a graphics
card, an Ethernet card, or serial port is a device driver. Similarly,
each piece of code that speaks to a class of devices such as SCSI disks,
ATAPI devices, ATA devices, etc., is also a device driver. This code
actually understands the device itself and manages it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id787801"></a>What is a module?</h3></div></div></div><p>
As explained above, modules present a uniform API for use by other
modules or drivers. This is a useful way of separating out commonly used
functionality from a driver.
</p><p>
Take the example of a SCSI device driver talking to a SCSI device. The
device hangs off a SCSI bus, which in turn may be one of many busses on
the system. All SCSI devices speak a common command set that is
independent of the controller used to send the commands. Rather than have
each SCSI driver (SCSI disk, SCSI CD, SCSI scanner, etc.) know how to
deal with each of the possible types of SCSI cards, it would be nice if
there were a generic interface to a SCSI card for each driver to use.
This is accomplished by having one module implement each SCSI card, which
then presents a generic API.
</p><p>
These modules are further managed by a SCSI "bus manager" module, which
knows how to deal with multiple busses and present them in an
encapsulated format to each driver. The bus manager's API is what the
driver has to deal with, reducing its complexity a great deal. We also
have USB, IDE and PCMCIA bus managers.
</p><p>
Another example of the use of the module architecture is a sound driver
which publishes a MIDI device. MIDI functionality can be encapsulated in
a module so that all sound drivers can access it, avoiding duplication in
each driver.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id787835"></a>How do these relate to the Kernel?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The kernel provides basic services so that drivers and modules can
function. Typically these are
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Enabling and disabling interrupts.
</p></li><li><p>
Setting up memory for DMA, etc.
</p></li><li><p>
Access to other devices and modules.
</p></li></ul><p>
The kernel also provides access at user level to devices using a "Posixy"
API. Devices can be opened by user programs through Posix calls such as
<code class="function">open</code>, <code class="function">read</code>,
<code class="function">write</code>, and <code class="function">ioctl</code>, which address the devices through file
descriptors. These calls turn into system calls in the kernel, and are
passed by devfs to the appropriate device driver, which then performs the
specified operation.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id787892"></a>User- or Kernel-level Driver?</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you want to write a driver for a device, one of the first decisions
you need to make is whether it should be at user or kernel level. A
kernel-level driver was described above; a user-level driver does the
same task by using an extant "raw" driver that knows how to handle that
class of device. For example, if you wanted to write a driver for a <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>
scanner, you could write an add-on at user level that opens up the scsi
raw device and send commands through scsi raw to the scanner. The
alternative would be to write a conventional kernel-level driver to
directly speak to the scanner.
</p><p>
The main advantage of operating at kernel level is speed. In this case,
one less context switch is required for command completion, so the
latency is lower compared to user level. In addition, if your driver
needs access to some peculiar hardware, it's rather difficult to do this
using a raw driver from user space.
</p><p>
The trade off is that it's much easier to debug at user level. You can
use conventional debugging techniques and there's less chance of taking
down the entire system in the process.
</p><p>
The above is merely a brief introduction to the topic. Stay tuned for
more in-depth pieces from various members of the kernel team.

The following transcript comes from a recent interview between myself and
Morgan le Be, the editor of SQUONK! Magazine. [NOTE: any resemblance to
other magazines, either real or imagined, is entirely coincidental.]
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id787984"></a><a id="id787986"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What is this <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code>, anyway?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> is part of a high-performance memory management system that
the BeOS genki/6 Media Kit provides.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788006"></a><a id="id788009"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Who uses <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code>?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> is primarily used in critical portions of the Media Kit.
Media node writers can also take advantage of <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> in the
time-sensitive portions of their code.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788033"></a><a id="id788035"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
But why wouldn't you just use <code class="function">malloc</code> like everybody else?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
To answer this, it's important to understand how <code class="function">malloc</code>
works. <code class="function">malloc</code>
first tries to reserve memory in <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> to give you what you need. If there
isn't enough room in <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>, the kernel's virtual memory system takes over.
The kernel then swaps out pages of memory from <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> to your hard drive to
make room for your request. In addition, memory created by <code class="function">malloc</code> can be
swapped to disk to make room for other memory that needs to be used. For
most applications, the overhead incurred by <code class="function">malloc</code> and virtual memory is
negligible compared to other performance factors that affect your code,
and the advantages offered by virtual memory far outweigh the cost.
</p><p>
For media nodes that must run in real time, however, <code class="function">malloc</code> is not good
enough. Why? Because the virtual memory management system costs you time,
not only from pushing blocks of memory around, but also from switching
between your thread and the kernel. And if this isn't heinous enough,
there's always the chance that your memory will be swapped out to disk
later on, resulting in possible additional overhead whenever you try to
access the memory. For time-sensitive media nodes, this overhead can be
crippling, causing audio glitches or other undesirable performance
artifacts.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788094"></a><a id="id788097"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
How does <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> solve this problem?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> is a mechanism which bypasses virtual memory and its vices.
As memory management systems go, <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> is almost painfully simple.
You use it by creating a pool of memory ahead of time. <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> then
assigns chunks of memory from this pool. In this case, allocating and
freeing memory are trivial operations on already extant memory. So, as
long the pool has enough available memory to deliver to you, no trip to
the kernel is necessary. In addition, the media real-time allocator will
lock this pool of memory into <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>, meaning that the memory cannot be
paged out by the virtual memory engine. In short, allocating and freeing
memory doesn't trigger <acronym class="acronym">VM</acronym>, and the memory you get will stick around in
RAM, so there's no <acronym class="acronym">VM</acronym> overhead there.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788145"></a><a id="id788148"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What are the drawbacks to using <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code>?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
The power of <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> is also its major drawback. Because you're
creating and locking a pool of memory for your application to use, that
memory is completely dedicated to your application—which means that
the effective amount of <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> available for other applications is reduced,
and their performance will suffer. Another potential problem you might
run into is memory fragmentation, as <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> does almost nothing to
deal with this issue. For these reasons, we recommend that you only use
<code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> when you absolutely need it.
</p><p>
Although memory is cheap, we realize that not everybody may want to
devote a significant chunk of their <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> exclusively to media applications
at the expense of the rest of their system. For this reason, the media
real-time allocator will only lock its memory pools into <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> if either
Real-Time Audio or Real-Time Video is enabled. These two options are set
by the user by check boxes in the Media Preferences panel.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788203"></a><a id="id788206"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
So, how do I use <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code>?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Here's how it basically works. See the header file
<code class="filename">RealtimeAlloc.h</code> in
the Media Kit for more details.
</p><p>
First, use <code class="function">rtm_create_pool</code> to create the memory pool you wish to use.
Because this creates an area, which involves the <acronym class="acronym">VM</acronym> system, you should do
this before the real-time madness starts. You give it the size of the
pool and the name (which should be <code class="constant">B_OS_NAME_LENGTH</code> bytes or less). You
get back an opaque pointer, <span class="type">rtm_pool*</span>, that uniquely identifies your pool.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that, when creating pools, you should try to specify the
minimum amount of memory that you'll need. Also note that there is some
overhead for every pool that you create, and the number of pools you can
have is limited, so it's better to create one pool for your purposes
rather than several smaller ones.
</p><p>
Another important note about pools: there is always one pool available
for use called the "default pool." This is the pool used by the Media Kit
for its own real-time allocation needs. I will forego subtlety and say:
don't use the default pool! Create your own pool instead, so that you
don't starve the Media Kit and associated classes.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">rtm_pool*</span> <code class="varname">my_pool</code>;
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="function">rtm_create_pool</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">my_pool</code>, 0x1000,
  "My Real-Time Pool");
if (<code class="varname">err</code> != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
  <span class="comment">// there's probably no <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> left for you to lock down:
  // the system is seriously stressed!</span>
  ...
}
</pre><p>
Now, once you have a pool, use <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> to get the memory you need. You
identify the pool and the amount of memory to reserve. If this pool
doesn't have enough memory left, not all is lost! <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> will try to
"grow" the pool by creating a new area big enough to hold the memory,
before failing. (Doing this could potentially involve <acronym class="acronym">VM</acronym>, though, so this
will cost you.)
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="varname">size</code> = ...;
<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="varname">ptr</code> = <code class="function">rtm_alloc</code>(<code class="varname">my_pool</code>, <code class="varname">size</code>);
if (! <code class="varname">ptr</code>) {
  <span class="comment">// Bad news, Buck: we're out of memory!</span>
  ...
}
</pre><p>
Once you're done with the memory, simply free it by using
<code class="function">rtm_free()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="function">rtm_free</code>(<code class="varname">ptr</code>);
if (<code class="varname">err</code> != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
  <span class="comment">// ptr was probably NULL</span>
  ...
}
</pre><p>
As soon as you're done using the memory pool, be sure to delete it, so
that the system can reclaim your <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> for others to use.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="function">rtm_delete_pool</code>(<code class="varname">my_pool</code>);
if (<code class="varname">err</code> != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
  <span class="comment">// my pool was probably already deleted</span>
  ...
}
</pre><p>
For an example of the real-time allocator in action, and how you can
redefine the C++ operators new and delete to use real-time allocation,
check out the sample code:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media kit/rtm_test.zip&gt;
</p><p>
This provides a couple of super-simple tests you can run on either
regularly allocated objects or <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code>'ed objects. Hopefully, this code
will demonstrate just how significant the performance savings can be,
though of course, your actual mileage will vary.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id788489"></a><a id="id788491"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Can I use <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> in other situations than media nodes?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Because <code class="function">rtm_alloc()</code> memory locking is controlled by the "Enable
Real-Time Audio/Video" check boxes in the Media Preferences panel, this
facility is not really appropriate for non-media applications. Any
application can, however, create a pool of memory that is locked into RAM
by using areas:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="varname">size</code> = ...;

<span class="comment">// round up to a multiple of the page size
// this works because B_PAGE_SIZE is a power of 2</span>
<code class="varname">size</code> = (<code class="varname">size</code> + <code class="constant">B_PAGE_SIZE</code> - 1) &amp; ~(<code class="constant">B_PAGE_SIZE</code> - 1);

 if (<code class="varname">area</code> &lt; 0) {
  <span class="comment">// some error occurred</span>

</pre><p>
Doing memory allocation from this pool (perhaps as a C++ allocator
template?) is left as an exercise for the reader.

A popular topic. Like the flu, it vanishes for a while, then returns as a
newer, more virulent strain. But far from me to complain—I like it
when Business Week and Newsweek stir up the pot. When Newsweek describes
a brave new Ether in which everyday objects swim in an ocean of IP
packets, I'm happy. That's because I look forward to using wireless PDAs
and to programming my VCR with a mouse click from a NetPositive page
somewhere in the house—or in the world. I'm happy because I see more
and more opportunities for the BeOS as the mutltimedia engine in these
connected applications.
</p><p>
Unsurprisingly, Bill Gates has views to share on the matter. He argues in
the same issue of Newsweek that the PC is with us forever, the center and
nexus of this brave new connected world (I paraphrase here, with no
warranties expressed or implied). Apparently, his statements are in
reaction to predictions that the PC will disappear, giving way to
specialized, task-specific devices that do a better job for less money
and less aggravation. Part of Chairman Bill's argument is that PCs will
become easier to understand, with a simpler user interface. They'll
provide the simplicity of a task-specific device, combined with the
protean permutations we've come to love in our computers.
</p><p>
Yes, I like personal computers. They're useful, fun, and if you really
invest enough time into making them work just right, you'll grow hair on
your chest. If I understand correctly, The Chairman is promising chest
alopecia some time in our future. Other people agree with him and believe
that a collaboration between Intel and Microsoft will deliver us to the
Promised Land of The Simple PC. From there, with a careful application of
Moore's Law, The Simple PC will become The Free PC, with the marginal
cost of the physical device absorbed by a service provider. Just like
free cell phones.
</p><p>
This is a seductive strategy. But last weekend, while cleaning the
shelves in my home office, I came across a Bob CD-ROM. It promised in the
early 90s what The SimplePC promises now—a simple, friendly interface.
The fact that it didn't work then doesn't necessarily predict that it
won't work in the future. Actually, I find Windows offers a well-designed
UI. But it does little to hide the growing complexity underneath. The
idea that you can put an interface layer above the gas refinery, and the
foul-smelling problems beneath it will never percolate to the surface is
just that—an idea—a seductive one without foundation in observed
behavior. This is an instance of a well-known sophism: It'll work because
it would be cool if it did. That's what we thought of handwriting
recognition.
</p><p>
I like PCs for what they do well; I agree with Microsoft's Chairman that
they're irreplaceable. But they can be complemented. This isn't an
either/or proposition. The Post-PC world is a misnomer—it makes good
headlines, but it masks a more complex reality. Just as automobiles
differentiated into all sorts of vehicles—some of which General Motors
refused to acknowledge for years—everyday computing devices will
continue to differentiate. In the twilight of the PC-centric era, we are
