One of the first things most developers do when given a new operating
system is to peruse the APIs to get a feel for what's there, what isn't,
and what should be. Most of our developers have done exactly that and
voiced their opinions on a number of issues. In looking at the Be OS
kernel API, the first thing that strikes any classic OS weenie is the
lack of nonblocking versions of <code class="function">read</code>/<code class="function">write_port()</code>
and <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code>.
We've been chastised for this, so we implemented additional functions for
DR8 that offer solutions to these problems. Let's start at the bottom:
Semaphores. In reviewing the semaphore API we noticed that the function
names were getting a little out of hand. For example, there were four
versions of the semaphore-acquisition function:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>)
<code class="function">acquire_sem_count</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>, <code class="parameter">count</code>)
<code class="function">acquire_sem_timeout</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
<code class="function">acquire_sem_count_timeout</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>, <code class="parameter">count</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
</pre><p>
The kernel had several more versions of these functions with even longer
names. Clearly this was not an API that could grow. For DR8 there are now
only two semaphore routines:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>)
<code class="function">acquire_sem_etc</code>(<code class="parameter">sem</code>, <code class="parameter">count</code>, <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
</pre><p>
The new routine, <code class="function">acquire_sem_etc()</code>, allows for a bit more flexibility in
specifying how you want to acquire a semaphore. The 'sem' and 'count'
arguments are of course the same as before. The new 'flags' argument lets
you set certain attributes when acquiring the semaphore; in particular,
you can set the semaphore's "apply timeout" flag, <code class="constant">B_TIMEOUT</code>. By applying
the timeout and passing a timeout value of 0, you tell the acquisition
function that you don't want to block. (In DR7, a timeout of 0 meant
"wait forever").
</p><p>
Given the presence of a nonblocking semaphore, it becomes trivial to
implement nonblocking <code class="function">read_port()</code> and <code class="function">write_port()</code> functions (in fact it
took less than five minutes!). The implementation mirrors that of
<code class="function">acquire_sem()</code>; the following functions are new for DR8:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">read_port_etc</code>(<code class="parameter">port</code>, <code class="parameter">code</code>, <code class="parameter">buf</code>, <code class="parameter">size</code>, <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
<code class="function">write_port_etc</code>(<code class="parameter">port</code>, <code class="parameter">code</code>, <code class="parameter">buf</code>, <code class="parameter">size</code>, <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
<code class="function">port_buffer_size_etc</code>(<code class="parameter">port</code>, <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <code class="parameter">timeout</code>)
</pre><p>
The 'flags' and 'timeout' arguments to these routines follow the same
conventions as the <code class="function">acquire_sem_etc()</code> routine. So by combining the
<code class="constant">B_TIMEOUT</code> flag with a timeout of zero you can do nonblocking port
operations. Of course you can specify longer timeouts if you desire.
</p><p>
The use of small or zero timeouts does raise some issues though: One fear
we have regarding the nonblocking functions is their potential for abuse.
The functions make it easy to write a program that constantly polls a
port or semaphore and simply burns CPU cycles while not accomplishing any
useful work. Doing that is what some people refer to as "A Bad Thing";
something we'd like to avoid. And so let us state up front that using a
zero or very small timeout to constantly poll a port or semaphore is not
acceptable.
</p><p>
How do you use these routines in a well-behaved manner then? One example
is our Browser, which has a thread that periodically does some work and
needs to know when to exit so it can cleanly free data structures, and so
on. A way to accomplish this is to have the thread do a nonblocking
acquire of a semaphore before it does its work, and then release the
semaphore when it's done. When the Browser wants the thread to exit it
simply grabs the semaphore and does a <code class="function">wait_for_thread()</code>. When the work
thread attempts to acquire the semaphore in a nonblocking manner, it will
get an error code (because the main Browser thread acquired the
semaphore). When the work thread fails to acquire the semaphore it knows
it's time to exit. This is a very simple mechanism that requires very
little extra code in either thread while producing clean, consistent
results.
</p><p>
As another example, consider a program where a background computation
thread (rendering, FFTs, and so on) works on data while a front end
allows a user to manipulate a GUI. Suppose that while the computation
thread is running the user adjusts some parameter that affects the
computation. Instead of waiting for the computation thread to finish
before being able to inform it of the changes, the GUI thread can send
the computation thread a message to tell it to restart. The computation
thread can periodically poll for these messages by doing a nonblocking
read of a message port. This is of course much cheaper and easier to do
than creating and killing threads on the fly. It also falls outside our
admonition about burning CPU cycles needlessly, because the computation
is performing useful work.
</p><p>
Of course nonblocking port operations aren't the only use for the timeout
parameter. The use of longer timeouts is very handy when you want to
avoid hanging on a client or server that fails to respond within some
specified time. By using timeouts you can improve the robustness of your
applications and make them impervious to misbehaving clients or servers
(also known as"A Good Thing").
</p><p>
These are just a few of the avenues you can explore with nonblocking and
timeout-based semaphore and port operations. We hope that this
functionality will allow you, our developers, to more easily create
applications that wow, excite, and titillate the public (OK, maybe not
titillate, but at least excite and wow).

I've always been an entrepreneur, writing database and production
automation software for large catalog and mail order companies. The
technology in this field has a long way to go, but I'm excited about
being a part of the process. There's a certain satisfaction in getting
clients—who aren't necessarily technically literate—involved in the
process of designing the tools that they'll be using. Even the smallest
indoctrination can prevent the horror of the ill-informed client who asks
for miracles and then merely shrugs when we deliver them.
</p><p>
There are four of us at Technical Magic. We've been spoiled for years
working with NeXT software, but the integrated database on the BeBox was
an ultimately compelling feature. More than anything else, we need a
machine that has good database tools, reliable performance, and network
scalability. I've only had my BeBox for about an hour so far, but things
look exciting. It seems that there may be some nasty font issues, and Orb
has crashed the machine a couple of times, but I'm impressed with the
dual processors and graphics appear real snappy. I've got more than a few
things yet to find in there I'm sure!
</p><p>
In the short term we hope to evaluate platform development tools, and
then build baseline business software. (Time and Contact Managers,
Financial Products, and so on—I figure all those prosperous Be
developers would like to count their coins on a BeBox, right?) Recovery
software might also be an area I'll explore. I'd also like to develop
hardware that attaches to the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™—break-out boxes and other
attachments.
</p><p>
This is, of course, a young machine that will create a new market. One of
the exciting things about the BeBox is that because of its newness, I can
influence the markets that are created. We'll see.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-31"></a>"Are You Crazy?"</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
We've said it many times: Harness a new platform (ours) to the Internet,
and you create a great opportunity for small, unenfranchised software
developers. On older platforms, a few dominant players, mostly US-based,
can use their muscle to prevent fledgling new entrants from reaching
critical mass. And without the affordable promotion and electronic
distribution made possible by the Internet, young companies are killed by
the expense of marketing.
</p><p>
As a result of what I've said and left unsaid, several readers of this
newsletter have questioned our apparent bias in favor of smaller software
developers. Your messages were invariably tactful—but the subtext was
clear:
</p><p>
"Are you crazy?"
</p><p>
"Aren't you better off courting the established players, getting them to
port their most successful applications to the BeBox, rather than looking
for the next John Warnock or the next Mitch Kapor amongst the Diaspora of
unwashed geeks?"
</p><p>
You've got a point.
</p><p>
One could make a nice list of industry-trusted, media- or
communications-intensive applications that would look great and run even
better if ported to the BeBox. Name your domain, from image processing to
video editing, from multimedia authoring to digital audio, web services
and software development for other platforms... Each time, a handful of
titles comes to mind. Isn't this the best way, the only way perhaps, to
find the "tractor application" the BeBox must get, or die?
</p><p>
The argument is seductively simple and intuitively obvious. But a couple
of observations play against it. The first observation comes from past
history. If memory serves, no new platform took off as a result of a port
from an older one. For instance, none of the DOS or Apple ][ applications
that were ported to the Macintosh actually helped the Mac. On the other
hand, the home-grown PageMaker did (and, later, also became successful on
Windows).
</p><p>
The second observation, or factor, is short-term economics. The primary
business of any large company that's already successful on Windows or the
Mac is fighting the competition and supporting existing customers. The
short-term return on an investment in a new platform with a small
installed base doesn't look good on Wall Street.
</p><p>
Still, let's assume that there exists a Be champion inside one of the
fast-moving, successful software companies. She or he convinces
management of the long-term benefits of betting on the Be platform,
gathers political support inside the organization, and gets the human and
financial resources needed for the port. What's required to complete a
product that works and sells?
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Stable management support is a must. Without it, the best people on
the team will be pulled away to put out other fires in the product line.
</p></li><li><p>
A combination of political and technical astuteness is also required.
This gets a little touchy. A straight port might be the easiest
political sell inside. But technically, and in the eye of the paying
customer as well, it might not make the most sense. For the "port" to
make technical and commercial sense, a substantial amount of redesign
might be required.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, the project needs a dancer's light tread to balance what
must be said and what must be done in order to reach successful
completion. Arabesque.
</p></li></ul><p>
In the end, working with a large, established player means working
against the conservative forces generated by its very success while using
its momentum to help our platform take off. By now (I hope) I'll have
confused our esteemed readers enough to convince them that working with
the leading software companies isn't "do or die"—it's not a slam dunk.
For example, we'd be flattered to see a "straight" port of Photoshop work
on the BeBox, but we'd rather convince Adobe to do on the BeBox what we
did ourselves: Maximize the benefits of innovation by shedding the
baggage from the past. We don't know yet if they or their colleagues will
do it, or if a small company will, but we'll do our best to find out.

The OpenDoc debate flared up when it was suggested that OLE might be a
welcome addition to the Be OS. Many listeners wrote in to object,
citing authorities and their own experiences. It was suggested that the
cogent questions are not about the quality of OpenDoc, but
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>

Some confusion over RAM, VM, the disk cache, and other memory matters:
Does VM exist? Can it be configured? Why does the BeBox immediately eat
up nearly all available RAM?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Yes, VM does exist and, no, it can't be "configured." The
latter is a feature, not a bug. (You can lock data into RAM by using
"areas"—see the Kernel Kit—but beyond that, the OS does the
driving.) Furthermore, the VM system has been improved in DR8 for more
efficient paging.
</p><p>
Regarding the "where'd all my RAM go?" business: The phrase "available
RAM" (as used by Pulse, for example) is a misnomer in a VM system,
particularly as it connotes evaporating resources. Rejoice when your
machine is using nearly all its RAM; that's what it's there for.

Why does rebooting a heavily file-laden BeBox take a disproportionate
amount of time?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: There are some boot-time database integrity checks that
will be removed once we're sure the database is unimpeachably stable.
This series of checks, whose duration is related to the number and size
of the files on your disk, is the primary cause of the boot delay. The
checks will probably remain in place until the file system rewrite
(post DR8). We apologize for the inconvenience.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id490588"></a>Subject: OS Suggestions</h4></div></div></div><p>
Be should provide a way to programmatically retrieve and set the colors
that are used to draw GUI widgets (the encapsulation of such was termed
a "pen"). When it was pointed out that a single widget is often a blend
of many colors, the proposition became: The programmer should be able
to declare a window's title bar to be blue (for example), and the
system should provide all the appropriate shading within the bar.
</p><p>
On other subjects, developers are yearning for UI guidelines and for
the scoop on "App Modeler," the GUI-building tool.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The UI guidelines and App Modeler will be part of DR8.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id490616"></a>Subject: View/ListView and font info</h4></div></div></div><p>
An initial query about how to retrieve font info turned into a
discussion of whether it would be more intuitive/easier/elegant to
express coordinates as a device-independent measure (as compared to the
status quo where points == pixels).
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Monitor-dependent point measurement greatly enhances
drawing speed and app server efficiency. We don't expect this to change.

The necessity and desirability of the traditional UNIX /proc and /dev

How do you set the shell prompt to display the current working
directory? A number of solutions were offered. The cleanest was this
(type this in a shell to test it; add it to your .profile when you're
happy):
</p><pre class="screen">
PS1="`pwd`&gt; "
</pre></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id490669"></a>Subject: Better keyboard shortcuts for Edit, etc.</h4></div></div></div><p>
Some folks are frustrated by the keyboard bindings used by Be's text
editors. The Home and End keys, in particular, are less than ideal:
They put you at the beginning and end of an entire document; some folks
would rather they operate on the current line. A repeated-key solution,
cribbed from BRIEF, was suggested: 1st Home goes to the beginning of
current line, 2nd is the top of the screen, 3rd is the top of the
document.
</p><p>
In general, consensus favors user-settable keyboard bindings and
"swappable" editors (such that you could use the editor of your choice
from within the IDE, for example).

Application A can't intercept system messages intended for application
B; nor can you find out which window the cursor is over if that window
isn't yours. A call for both features was made. The utility of the
get-me-the-window feature was questioned: What could application A *do*
with application B's window? After an initial muddying of objects and
pixels, an answer was offered: Application A could send a message to
the "foreign" window.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id490713"></a>Subject: What about the desktop?</h4></div></div></div><p>
It was suggested that the Browser allow icons to be left on the "desktop"
(a la the Mac). But does a desktop filled with icons look too cluttered?
As an alternative, the dock could provide "drawers" for storing multiple
icons (this would replace the current dog-eared stack of icons).
