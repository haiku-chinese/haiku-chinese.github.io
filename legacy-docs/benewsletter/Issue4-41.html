One of the more compelling things that sets BeOS apart from many other
operating systems is its ability to get low-latency timing from user
applications. There have been a few articles talking about high
resolution timing for certain events, both from kernel and user space,
but I would like to talk a little more about general strategies for
writing timing critical apps, as well as giving a little more information
about how BeOS works under the hood.
</p><p>
BeOS is probably best described as a "soft real time" operating system.
It differs from "hard real time" operating systems—typically small
embedded systems—in being more general purpose and having higher-level
facilities, such as VM. However, it still allows very precise timing and
latencies.
</p><p>
I will be referring specifically to scheduling latency in this article,
that being the amount of time it takes an operating system to service
hardware or timing requests. This is important, for example, in real time
sound applications. Take a multitrack recorder app; you may want to lay
down one instrument track, then go back and record another one. The app
would play the first track as it recorded the second. You'd hear both
tracks mixed together as they played back. But, if the sound takes too
long to get from input to output, the user will notice an annoying delay.
</p><p>
In order to reduce this delay you need small audio buffers, which in turn
require the app to wake up more often to read and write buffers to and
from the audio device. If the app can't wake up fast enough you'll hear
glitching and pops in the output and/or recorded data. Even for an
amateur home producer, this would be unacceptable. One solution to this
problem is to move the app's timing-critical code into a device driver,
where it can be closer to the hardware. This is crufty, to say the least.
</p><p>
With BeOS you can get low latencies without resorting to this kind of
trickery, as the sample code will demonstrate:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#include &lt;OS.h&gt;

#define <code class="constant">SNOOZE_TIME</code> 150000

int main()
{
  <span class="type">bigtime_t</span> <code class="varname">start</code>, <code class="varname">elapsed_time</code>;

  <code class="function">set_thread_priority</code>(<code class="function">find_thread</code>(<code class="constant">NULL</code>), 120);
  for (;;) {
    <code class="varname">start</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
    <code class="function">snooze</code>(<code class="constant">SNOOZE_TIME</code>);
    <code class="varname">elapsed_time</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>() - <code class="varname">start</code>;
    <code class="function">printf</code>("%Lu microseconds late\n", <code class="varname">elapsed_time</code> - <code class="constant">SNOOZE_TIME</code>);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre><p>
This app simply measures how accurate <code class="function">snooze()</code> is. You may be surprised
to find that it's generally very close, depending on load. There are a
number of reasons why BeOS is this accurate. The first is that it
dynamically programs a hardware timer to go off exactly when the <code class="function">snooze()</code>
expires. Also, the kernel is preemptive, which means the scheduler can be
invoked, even while a thread is executing kernel code. It is the
convention of a number of operating systems, especially some of the Un*x
flavor, to reschedule in the kernel only when a thread explicitly blocks,
or when a system call returns. The reason is that these are known points
that are not in a kernel critical section. This simplifies the design of
the kernel, because intricate locking is not required.
</p><p>
For server machines, where latency is not as important, this is adequate.
However, this limits the system's ability to respond to interrupts as
quickly as you might like. For example, let's say thread A sleeps on a
semaphore, waiting for a hardware interrupt handler to release the
semaphore. Thread B begins to run, then performs a system call which
requires quite a bit of processing in the kernel. While thread B is doing
its thing, an interrupt comes in (such as the hardware timer interrupt in
the example used above) and sets thread A runnable. On some operating
systems, thread A would not actually start until thread B finished
whatever it was doing and returned from the system call. BeOS has been a
multiprocessor OS from its infancy, requiring fine-grained locking in the
kernel, and therefore does not have this restriction. Under BeOS, Thread
A would start running as soon as the interrupt was handled, leaving
Thread B ready but still in the kernel.
</p><p>
As a programmer, there are few things you need to be aware of when trying
to get tight latencies. Cyril wrote an informative article detailing how
the BeOS scheduler works at
</p><p>
<a class="xref" href="Issue1-37.html#Engineering1-37" title="Be Engineering Insights: The Kernel Scheduler and Real-Time Threads">Be Engineering Insights: The Kernel Scheduler and Real-Time Threads</a>
</p><p>
BeOS defines 120 priority levels, with priorities 100 and above being "real
time." Being real time has two implications for threads. First, the
thread will not be preempted, except by threads of higher priority. This
gives you a guaranteed execution time. It also adds the responsibility
that the thread get its work done in a short amount of time, lest it
degrade system performance. And it says that the thread will start
executing shortly after it becomes ready to run, even when the system is
under load. The kernel enforces a rule that a real time thread will not
sit in its ready queue unless an equal or higher real time thread is
running.
</p><p>
VM is another issue to consider. If a thread page faults, it can easily
wait 20 milliseconds for the data to be read off_the disk. While this is
barely noticeable for many apps, it can be really bad for timing-critical
apps. For this reason, you may want to store all your timing-critical
data in locked areas (that is, <code class="function">create_area()</code> with
the <code class="constant">B_FULL_LOCK</code> flag),
or use the realtime allocator defined in
<code class="filename">RealtimeAlloc.h</code>. Also, there are
two functions called <code class="function">media_realtime_init_image()</code> and
<code class="function">media_realtime_init_thread()</code>, defined in
<code class="filename">MediaDefs.h</code>, that lock image areas and thread
stacks, respectively.
</p><p>
Making VM calls, including <code class="function">create_area()</code>,
<code class="function">delete_area()</code>, <code class="function">resize_area()</code>,
<code class="function">find_area()</code>, <code class="function">get_area_info()</code>, etc.
can cause unnecessary delays, as they
perform quite a bit of locking in the kernel, and lower-priority threads
may be holding those locks. As BeOS doesn't currently support priority
inheritance, making these calls gives no guarantee that it will return as
quickly as you may need it to. Try to avoid making these calls from
timing sensitive code.
</p><p>
In many cases, it's desirable to perform file I/O associated with real
time processing. Even if the disk can support the data rate you need (it
generally can), disk access is very sporadic, being bound to the movement
of a mechanical head, which is orders of magnitude slower than the
processor. In this case, you can emulate async I/O by running another
thread that reads data into a buffer, then having the real time thread
work on the data within this buffer.
</p><p>
Note that a bit of restraint is important here. Locked memory is an
expensive resource, and doing too much CPU-intensive processing in a real
time thread can degrade system performance. Before trying some of these
techniques, you should determine what your latency tolerances are and how
well your app can handle them without locking memory or bumping up thread
priorities.

BeOS provides a collection of C++ classes that make it a little easier to
write networking software. These classes, <code class="classname">BNetAddress</code>,
<code class="classname">BNetBuffer</code>,
<code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code>, and <code class="classname">BNetDebug</code>,
give you friendly object-oriented access to networking.
</p><p>
In this article, we'll create a very simple server. It waits for
connections on a specific port (hardcoded to 4242, but you could expand
this to be configurable), and whenever a connection is made, it transmits
the contents of a given file over the connection, then automatically
closes the connection.
</p><p>
The program, called <span class="application">Responder</span>, is launched from the command line by
typing <code class="command">responder filename</code>,
where   filename  is the name of the file that
should be sent when connections are made. The file can be any size, and
can be binary or text. No attributes are preserved and no compression is
done (this is a simple protocol, but you can expand on it if you want
to). The assumption is that the connection is being established by a
client application that knows what the file name and attributes should be
(for example, a program that runs nightly to fetch updated data from a
central server for a database solution).
</p><p>
You can build this program by copying the code into a source file and
compiling it. Be sure to include the libnetapi.so library.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">main()</code> function's primary purpose is to parse the command line and
spawn the listener thread. In a more perfect server application, it might
also set up a user interface for configuring the server or monitoring the
server's status. Let's have a look:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;NetAddress.h&gt;
#include &lt;NetEndpoint.h&gt;
#include &lt;File.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;OS.h&gt;

static <span class="type">long</span> <code class="function">responder_proc</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">data</code>);
static <span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">send_file</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">filename</code>, <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> *<code class="parameter">connect</code>);
static <span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">send_error</code>(<code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> *<code class="parameter">connect</code>);

<span class="type">int</span> main(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">argc</code>, <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">argv</code>[]) {
  <span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">filename</code>;
  <span class="type">thread_id</span> <code class="varname">responder_thread</code>;
  <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code>;

  if (<code class="parameter">argc</code> != 2) {
    <code class="function">printf</code>("usage: responder &lt;filename&gt;\n");
    return 1;
  }

  <code class="varname">filename</code> = <code class="parameter">argv</code>[1];  <span class="comment">// Filename of file to send</span>

  <code class="varname">responder_thread</code> = <code class="function">spawn_thread</code>(<code class="function">responder_proc</code>,
        "File Responder", <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_PRIORITY</code>, <code class="varname">filename</code>);
  <code class="function">resume_thread</code>(<code class="function">responder_thread</code>);
  <code class="function">wait_for_thread</code>(<code class="function">responder_thread</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">err</code>);
  return 0;
}
</pre><p>
This is pretty basic stuff. The responder thread is spawned with
<code class="constant">B_NORMAL_PRIORITY</code>, the filename specified on the command line is passed to it, and
the thread is started by calling <code class="function">resume_thread()</code>.
Then <code class="function">main()</code> waits for
that thread to terminate before exiting the program.
</p><p>
The thread function, <code class="function">responder_proc()</code>, sets up a network listener on port
4242 and handles incoming requests:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="function">responder_proc</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">data</code>) {
  <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> <code class="varname">endpoint</code>;

    return -1;
  }
  <code class="varname">endpoint</code>.<code class="methodname">Bind</code>(4242);    <span class="comment">// Bind to port 4242</span>
  <code class="varname">endpoint</code>.<code class="methodname">Listen()</code>;      <span class="comment">// Listen for incoming connections</span>

  while (1) {

    <code class="varname">connect</code> = <code class="varname">endpoint</code>.<code class="methodname">Accept()</code>;    <span class="comment">// Wait for a connection</span>
    if (<code class="varname">connect</code>) {
      <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">hostname</code>[256];
      <span class="type">in_addr</span> <code class="varname">addr</code>;
      <code class="varname">connect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">RemoteAddr()</code>.<code class="methodname">GetAddr</code>(<code class="varname">hostname</code>);
      <code class="varname">connect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">RemoteAddr()</code>.<code class="methodname">GetAddr</code>(<code class="varname">addr</code>);
      <code class="function">printf</code>("Connection from %s (%08X)\n", <code class="varname">hostname</code>, <code class="varname">addr.s_addr</code>);
      <code class="function">send_file</code>((<span class="type">const char *</span>) <code class="parameter">data</code>, <code class="varname">connect</code>);
      delete <code class="varname">connect</code>;
    }
  }

  <code class="varname">endpoint</code>.<code class="methodname">Close()</code>;
}
</pre><p>
It begins by creating a <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code>
on the stack. The <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> class
represents one end of a network connection; all interactions on a
connection are done through <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> functions.
<code class="methodname">BNetEndpoint::InitCheck()</code> is called to ensure that the endpoint was
created without incident; it returns -1 at once if an error occurred
during construction.
</p><p>
Then the endpoint is bound to port 4242, and <code class="methodname">BNetEndpoint::Listen()</code> is
called to begin listening for incoming connections. By default, <code class="function">Listen()</code>
allows up to five connection requests to be backlogged, but you can
optionally specify this value. For our purposes, five is plenty.
</p><p>
A "while" loop, which never terminates, then begins. In real life, you'd
have this loop terminate when the user clicked a "Stop server" button, or
something similar. As it is, the server can only be terminated by
pressing <span class="keysym">Control</span>+<span class="keysym">C</span>
from the terminal, or by killing it. This loop
repeatedly attempts to accept incoming connections, and sends the file
over them.
</p><p>
First, the <code class="methodname">BNetEndpoint::Accept()</code> function is called. By default,
<code class="methodname">Accept()</code> blocks indefinitely until a connection attempt occurs; you can
optionally specify a timeout. Once a connection is made, a new
<code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> is returned, which duplicates the original endpoint except
that there's now a connection to the remote client. This new endpoint,
connect, is used to interact with the newly connected remote system.
</p><p>
We first use the <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> function <code class="methodname">RemoteAddr()</code> and the
<code class="methodname">BNetAddress::GetAddr()</code> functions to get the hostname and IP address of
the remote system, and then we print that information to the terminal as
a rudimentary log. Then we call send file(), which we'll see momentarily,
to actually transmit the file.
</p><p>
Finally, we delete the connection, which closes it and terminates the
interaction. The loop then continues, calling <code class="methodname">Accept()</code> again to get the
next client's request.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">send_file()</code> function does the real work of transmitting the file over
the connection:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">send_file</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">filename</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> *</span><code class="parameter">connect</code>) {
  <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code>;
  <span class="type">off_t</span> <code class="varname">filesize</code>;
  <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="varname">buffer</code>[65536];

  <span class="comment">// Open the file, abort if an error occurs.</span>

  <code class="classname">BFile</code> <code class="varname">file</code>(<code class="varname">filename</code>, <code class="constant">B_READ_ONLY</code>);

    return;
  }

  <code class="function">memcpy</code>(<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="varname">s</code>, <code class="varname">count</code>);
  <code class="varname">connect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Send</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="varname">count</code>);

  <span class="comment">// Now read the file, in chunks, and stuff them into the buffer,
  // sending the buffer each time.</span>

  while (1) {
    <span class="type">ssize_t</span> <code class="varname">size</code> = <code class="varname">file</code>.<code class="methodname">Read</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 65536);

    if (<code class="varname">size</code> &lt; 65536) {
      break;        <span class="comment">// We're done</span>
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>
A 64KB buffer is allocated on the stack, and we then open the file for
reading by creating a <code class="classname">BFile</code> object referencing the filename specified on
launch. If an error occurs (as determined by calling <code class="methodname">BFile::InitCheck()</code>,
we call send error() to transmit an error code (this is just the string
"ERROR\n") and return at once.
</p><p>
Otherwise we get the file's size by calling <code class="methodname">BFile::GetSize()</code>. If an error
occurs here, again, we send the error code and return.
</p><p>
Once we know the file size, we transmit it to the client by stuffing the
size (in <acronym class="acronym">ASCII</acronym>) into the buffer and then transmitting it to the client
using the <code class="methodname">BNetEndpoint::Send()</code> function, specifying a pointer to the
buffer and the number of bytes in the string, not including the null
terminator.
</p><p>
Then we use a loop to read the file in 64KB chunks, transmitting each
chunk to the client. Once the entire file is sent, the loop ends and the
transfer is complete. After <code class="function">send_file()</code> returns, the connection is closed
by the responder thread.
</p><p>
Again, this is a very simple server application, but with only a little
work, it can be adapted into a useful application. Add a little <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym>
protocol handling, and you have a rudimentary web server, for example.
The basics are there; all that's needed is some protocol handling and a
user interface.

No, this isn't my contribution to The Great Millennium (or Halloween)
Scare. It's about something much smaller—the size of transistors and
the end of Moore's Law.
</p><p>
We just heard a warning from an Intel scientist: With the next generation
of silicon fabrication technology, known as .1 micron, the basic storage
or switching building block might become too small to be reliable. Too
small, in this case, means the state of a building block might rely on
less than a hundred electrons. Several factors can affect the actual
number: manufacturing variances; quantum fluctuations; and various
sources, natural or artificial, of radioactivity generating stray
electrons.
</p><p>
When a binary state is built on millions of electrons dwelling in a
silicon junction, a few stray electrons can hardly make a difference.
With the base level down to a hundred or so, the scientist says, the
distinction between zeroes and ones becomes unreliable. As a result,
Moore's Law stops "working." In other words, we can no longer expect the
price/performance ratio of our favorite silicon devices to double every
18 months.
</p><p>
A historical note: When Gordon Moore, an Intel founder, first formulated
the observation subsequently elevated and christened into a law bearing
his name, the cycle was pegged at 24 months. Lately, meaning in the last
36 months, progress has been arguably swifter. Just compare a 400 Mhz
Celeron with a 100 Mhz Pentium of the Summer of '96 vintage.
</p><p>
Let's make two assumptions here. One, the Intel scientist is right and no
amount of human ingenuity, even from Intel's competition, will change the
situation. Two, I blush at the mere thought, this isn't a carefully
crafted message from our friends, an artful set-up for some upcoming
announcement.
</p><p>
Taking the story at face value, does it mean the end of the silicon go-go
days? Perhaps, but let's look more closely at the consequences. Today's
personal computers are imbalanced. By this I mean the speed of various
organs is wildly out of whack, as exhibited by all sorts of caching
schemes and memory and bus standards disagreements. I still wait for the
leading computer magazines to buy a good logic analyzer and tell their
readers how often one part of the system sits idle while another is
choking. And, while they're at it, how long does the program counter
point to OS code versus user applications?
</p><p>
I know, I know, good OS code does a lot of work so that applications just
have to call for the right OS routines... If processors stop making the
easy leaps we've learned to expect, generation after generation, perhaps
the rest of the beloved PC clone organ bank will receive more attention.
As a result, a 1GHz processor will run at full speed, instead of
twiddling its thumbs, waiting for memory.
</p><p>
But maturation of silicon technology might lead to other
reconsiderations. Moore's Law has been a source of cheap fixes, and we're
grateful for those. But with these fixes no longer available in some
version of the future, we might look again at our current brute force
approach. Today, it doesn't matter much if a silicon architecture is less
than perfect—tomorrow's generation will have twice the
price/performance. Therefore, backwards compatibility, in spite of the
layers of silt it generates, is inexpensive.
</p><p>
Actually, this holds true for software as well. That's why we have
bloated, backwards compatible software, sitting atop large, backwards
compatible microprocessors. The end of Moore's Law might cause a
re-evaluation of the balance between the benefits of backwards
compatibility and the cost of silt. Which is to say, new hardware and
software architectures might arise from such re-evaluation. This leaves
us with two partially interchangeable questions: When and on which life
forms might such new architectures arise? On existing computing devices
such as PCs, or on emerging ones in the sense that PCs were more than
just smaller minicomputers?
