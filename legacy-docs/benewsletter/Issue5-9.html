The other day, I was admiring the largish pond that was placidly
engulfing our parking lot, when I chanced to see someone sitting on the
curb at the other end of the lot, casting their fishing line into the
murky depths. At first I assumed it was someone catching trout for the
newly opened fish restaurant next door. When her eyes met mine, however,
I realized that it was none other than the infamous hacker, Morgan le Be.
</p><p>
"Hey, it's a good thing you're here," she called out to me. "Fishing
always brings out my philosophical side. So, tell me—how do I know
when a CD is inserted into or removed from a drive? For that matter, can
I tell if a drive itself is being inserted or removed from my system?"
</p><p>
The answer to this question is somewhat involved, so I promised her that
I'd write a newsletter article about it. And here it is.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518091"></a>Introducing devfs (to the Rest of Us)</h3></div></div></div><p>
The solution to this problem depends on a somewhat clever use of devfs to
get information about the drives and removable media in your system.
Unlike many previous articles on the subject, I'll assume that you're
approaching devfs from the application-writing level, not as a driver
writer. So here's a gentle introduction to devfs for the uninitiated.
</p><p>
devfs is the (not-so-) friendly name we give to the "device file system".
The device file system is a virtual collection of directories and files,
mounted at "/dev", that the system creates to give low-level access to
various devices in your system. This includes disk drives, input devices,
and peripheral cards. This low-level system allows you to communicate
directly with the drivers that work with the hardware on your system --
if you know what you're doing. (Of course, as with any low-level and
high-power construct, you have an immense opportunity to shoot yourself
and attendant hardware in the foot if you muck around with these devices
unadvisedly, so be careful!)
</p><p>
How do you work with these devices? If you're familiar with UNIX, you'll
recognize the paradigm instantly. Although the files in devfs are not
actual files stored on disk, you work with them as if they were actual
files, meaning that you can read and write to them using the <code class="function">read()</code> and
<code class="function">write()</code> system calls, among others. Similarly, the directories in devfs
aren't actual directories on a disk, but you can traverse them using
standard directory commands. Note that devices are identified primarily
by the directory structure (which is generally extensive and
descriptive); the files reside at the bottom of the directory structure,
usually with terse names, to provide the actual access to the device. For
a more complete introduction to devfs, read the Good Book:
</p><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/DeviceDrivers_Introduction-2.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs">DeviceDrivers_Introduction.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs</a>
</p><p>
So, to talk to a driver, you simply find the file that corresponds to the
driver you want to talk to, and invoke system functions on the file to
communicate with the driver—for example, <code class="function">read()</code> and <code class="function">write()</code> will
usually get raw data into and out of the driver. There is an additional
system call, called <code class="function">ioctl</code>, that's extremely handy when talking to
drivers—in fact, we'll be using it in just a moment. <code class="function">ioctl</code> (short for
"I/O Control", we pronounce it "eye-AWK-tul") is a generic interface that
allows you to send an opcode and a data structure to the driver to get
information into or out of the driver. For the curious,
<code class="filename">Drivers.h</code>
contains a big list of common <code class="function">ioctl</code> opcodes that drivers support, and
what they do.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518186"></a>Introducing Drive Daemon</h3></div></div></div><p>
Now that the introductory remarks are out of the way, let's look at the
code. Drive Daemon is a background process that tracks all the disk
drives in the system, and monitors their status. It sends out
notifications when certain actions happen that affect disk drives. You
can find the code at:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/storage_kit/DriveDaemon.zip&gt;
</p><p>
There are two basic kinds of actions that DriveDaemon detects and handles:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
The drive itself is added or removed (e.g., plugging in or unplugging
PCMCIA drives).
</p></li><li><p>
The media inside the drive changes (e.g., when you insert or eject a
CD).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The distinction between these two kinds of events is subtle, but it's
important, because these two different kinds of actions end up being
detected by DriveDaemon in totally different ways.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518234"></a>Enumerating the Drives in the System</h3></div></div></div><p>
The first task that befalls Drive Daemon is to locate all the disk drives
in the system. Do this by examining all the directories under
<code class="filename">/dev/disk</code>
and finding all the files named "raw." By naming convention, files in the
<code class="filename">/dev/disk</code> hierarchy called
"raw" are used to obtain raw access to a disk,
as opposed to access to specific partitions on a disk. Once we find one
of these files, we create a Drive object (which is in charge of
monitoring the status of this disk drive) and add it to a list of drives
that we're keeping track of.
</p><p>
To be a bit more selective about the kinds of disks we're interested in,
Drive Daemon can query the driver about what kind of disk a particular
device entry represents. This is done by using the <code class="function">ioctl</code> system call
mentioned above to issue the command <code class="constant">B_GET_GEOMETRY</code>. For example, here's
how we can tell if a particular drive is a CD-ROM drive:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">fd</code> = ...; <span class="comment">// this is the POSIX descriptor for the</span>
              <span class="comment">// raw disk, obtained via open()</span>
<span class="type">device_geometry</span> g;
if (ioctl(<code class="varname">fd</code>, <code class="constant">B_GET_GEOMETRY</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">g</code>,
    sizeof(<code class="varname">device_geometry</code>)) &gt; 0)
{
    if (<code class="varname">g</code>.<code class="varname">device_type</code> == <code class="constant">B_CD</code>) {
        <span class="comment">// it's a CD-ROM drive</span>
    } else {
        <span class="comment">// it's some other kind of drive</span>
    }
}
</pre><p>
See, <code class="function">ioctl</code>s are a piece of cake! But we're not done with them yet...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518359"></a>Checking Media Status</h3></div></div></div><p>
Next, let's figure out when the media inside a disk drive changes (this
affects floppy drives, CD-ROM drives, and other drives with removable
media). The way to do this is to have the Drive object periodically poll
the driver for its status using an <code class="function">ioctl</code> command that was custom-built
for this purpose, <code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code>. For example, here's how you can
tell if a new CD has been inserted into a CD-ROM drive:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">fd</code> = ...; <span class="comment">// this is the POSIX file descriptor for</span>
              <span class="comment">// the raw disk, obtained via open()</span>
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">mediaStatus</code>;
if (ioctl(<code class="varname">fd</code>, <code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">mediaStatus</code>,
    sizeof(<span class="type">status_t</span>)) &gt;= 0)
{
    switch (<code class="varname">mediaStatus</code>) {
    case <code class="constant">B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGED</code>:
        <span class="comment">// new CD to scan</span>
        break;
    default:
        <span class="comment">// something else happened</span>
        break;
    }
}
</pre><p>
One caveat here: the driver can only keep track of whether the media
changed if the driver is kept open while the CD is removed and reinserted
-- it forgets everything about its previous state when it is closed. So,
for this to work, we have to open the driver when the daemon starts, and
keep it open while the daemon is running, which is what Drive Daemon
does. For bonus fries, this also cuts down on the performance drawback to
opening and closing the driver every time we need to check on the status
of the drive.
</p><p>
More information about removable media can be found in the following
newsletter article:
</p><p>
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-44.html#Engineering3-44" title="Be Engineering Insights: Removable Media">Be Engineering Insights: Removable Media</a>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518471"></a>Checking Removable Drives</h3></div></div></div><p>
Whereas checking the status of removable media is super- simple, checking
to see whether a drive itself has been removed is a bit trickier. The
technique hinges on the fact that, when a removable drive is unplugged
from a bus, the corresponding device driver will republish its devices to
indicate which devices are no longer available. Similarly, when a
removable drive is plugged in, the driver must republish its devices to
reflect the new additions to the system. This publish/unpublish
methodology results in devfs entries being removed and added. So, you
can't just keep querying your "raw" file to see whether the drive is
removed, because the file might be swept out from under your feet.
</p><p>
"But wait," I think I hear you say. "I can check to see whether files and
directories are added or deleted on my hard drive by using the Node
Monitor. Couldn't I just use this in the device hierarchy as well?"
Indeed, you can do just that—which is where the real power and beauty
of devfs manifests itself!
</p><p>
Let's look at the specifics. First of all, for those of you who think the
Node Monitor is a diagnostic machine used by lymphologists, a bit of
orientation: the Node Monitor is a service the system provides to notify
you when files or directories are added, deleted, move their location, or
change their data. For a more complete description, I refer you, once
again, to the Good Book:
</p><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/The_Node_Monitor.html">The_Node_Monitor.html</a>
</p><p>
To use it, you need to call watch_node for every directory you want to
track. To see when entries get added or removed, we need to monitor all
the directories beneath <code class="filename">/dev/disk</code>.
To pick up all of these directories, we start with
<code class="filename">/dev/disk</code> and recursively walk down the directory structure
from there, picking up directories as we go. Later, when we receive
notifications that items are added or removed from one of these
directories, we start or stop watching those items, respectively. It's a
bit of a brute force method, but because devfs directory hierarchies tend
to be deep but not broad, there's not too much performance penalty for
all of this watching. See the code for more details.

Having gone through all the trouble of learning this stuff, you may wonder
what use you can put it to. The first, foremost, and most obvious use is
for writing an automounter (i.e., what Tracker uses to mount volumes when
media and disks are detected). But there are other more creative uses as
well—imagine popping up a CD window when a CD is inserted in a drive, or
setting up an automated system for formatting and burning Compact Flash
cards when they are plugged into your machine.

My last column described the Internet Appliance space as no space at all.
I tried to make the point that the term "Internet Appliance" covers a
diverse and motley assemblage of devices. I recall that once upon a time,
in an era far, far away, Chairman Gates shrugged off the suggestion of
creating an Internet Division at Microsoft. He more or less said, in the
famous 1995 Pearl Harbor speech, that the Internet was like electricity,
and you didn't need an electricity division, since everything runs on it
anyway. The wisdom of the Chairman notwithstanding, Microsoft announced
the creation of an Internet group two or three months later. This led
NeXT's Chairman Steve to remark, "Microsoft treats me the way I expected
Netscape to treat me and Netscape deals with me the way I feared
Microsoft would."
</p><p>
Back to appliances. What electrifies them is the Internet. Just as the
term "electrical appliances" requires subcategories, we need to organize
our thoughts a bit when looking at this new genre of devices. For the
time being, I have two simple proposals. First, use the PC as an organ
bank rather than a thought bank. The "sub-PC" appliance doesn't feel like
a very viable idea—a PC, only smaller and cheaper. When I look at my
Libretto, a very capable BeOS and Windows 98 machine, I don't really want
something smaller. The Libretto already fits easily on the kitchen
counter, on my lap in bed, or on the tray in a coach seat on Southwest,
and inside the pocket of my L.L. Bean field coat. Add a wireless PC-Card
Ethernet connection or a Ricochet modem and the size argument for a
"sub-PC" disappears.
</p><p>
Cheaper? There are free, or quasi-free PCs—PeoplePC, for one. For the
monthly subscription rate of a vanilla ISP, you get a PC, the Internet
connection and "much more," such as in-home service. Why bother with less
than a PC when such a deal is available?
</p><p>
I'm personally familiar with a related argument. I sold desktop
computers, minicomputers and, now, I sell a software platform for
appliances. At every turn I met the question, "why do I need this since I
already have ...." The worst sales situations were the ones where the
customer, or the salesperson, tried to shoehorn the contents, the
application, or the larger device into the smaller one, trying to do more
in less.
</p><p>
Most anything else could be made to work, as in making a good sale:
taking the order, shipping the product, having the customer keep the
product and pay the bill, getting the commission check and spending it.
More for less, less for less, different for less, or even more,
sometimes, but no shoehorn. VisiCalc was both more and different for
less, AppleWriter was less for less—you get the idea.
</p><p>
My second proposal is to look at two categories of appliances; those with
a hard disk and those without. It's a little simplistic, but it helps.
With the diskless appliances, we have a device managed from the network.
From IP telephony to information appliances, the heavy lifting is
performed by the network, by one or more servers. This kind of appliance
does less for less—the "more" part is simplicity.
</p><p>
Word documents are translated into HTML by the server, for instance;
software updates, when needed, are managed remotely. As some observers
noted, this sounds like a reincarnation of the NC. Well, yes and no. Yes,
the NC idea was to do less for less; no, in 1995, when it was aired, the
NC relied on X-Windows, which is neither simple nor less as a software
platform, nor as a user experience. In that regard, we're indebted to QNX
for showing what could be done on a small footprint, which led us to
experiment with what we informally called BeNC a little over three years
ago.
</p><p>
By virtue of having hard disk storage, appliances with such a feature
also afford the user more control. What do I keep, what do I throw away
(the "what" being mostly music or video). Think video recorders à la
Tivo or Replay, or stereos with a combination of local storage and a Net
connection.
</p><p>
At one end of the spectrum are "diskless" information appliances, at the
other end are "diskfull" entertainment devices. As noted before, we're in
the early stage of this emerging genre. With such a stage comes
considerable confusion and the possibility of being embarrassed later by
one's pronouncements. I like the confusion—to me it means opportunity.
As for the occasional embarrassment, it's a small price to pay for the
freedom to try thoughts out.
