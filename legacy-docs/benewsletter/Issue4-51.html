A while back, Ficus wrote a touching newsletter article about a kernel
engineer venturing out into the big world of user space. As he didn't
have time to finish his latest article before leaving for Christmas, he
asked me to fill in for him, so I thought I would tell the mirror story.
</p><p>
I am but a lowly apps engineer, comfortable in my world of object
oriented code and fancy tools, and the kernel is a big, strange place.
Perhaps the biggest oddity I find with the kernel is the lack of C++. No
multiple virtually inherited templatized functors, nor polymorphic
container iterators. Most kernel people I talk to shudder and turn white
when I mention using C double-plus in the kernel. Undeterred, I'm going
to write about issues that bear on doing just that.
</p><p>
Be does not currently support C++ in the kernel, nor has it officially
made any plans ever to do so. What I've been told (in a rather serious,
fatherly tone) is that you should use C for drivers. So, with that
disclaimer out of the way, and I hope without having brutally offended
Cyril or Ficus (or any other kernel engineers; they're a very sensitive
group), let's examine this more closely.
</p><p>
A driver is nothing more than a shared library that's loaded by the
kernel as an add-on. There are three requirements for a kernel add-on:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
The binary is of the ELF or PEF format (depending on your platform).
</p></li><li><p>
Calls to kernel functions, or from the kernel to driver functions
use the standard C style invocation; arguments are pushed onto the
stack right to left and the caller cleans up the stack.
</p></li><li><p>
The binary has all the runtime support it needs compiled in.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
That's it. You may notice that this is a pretty broad definition.
Language features such as name mangling, virtual method dispatch, and
templates are not taken into consideration. That's because these things
are totally internal to the compiler. The (gcc) compiler simply converts
a text file containing a high-level language into a text file containing
assembly language. The assembler knows nothing about C++ or its many
colorful features. You can look at the assembly output of the compiler by
using the  -S  flag for GCC. If you're unsure about the implementation of
some feature, don't guess. Use   -S  and pick through the assembly. It can
be very educational.
</p><p>
For starters, I'll point out that using high-level libraries like STL is
out of the question. Remember that memory used by the kernel is wired in
place and can't be paged out like application memory can. This reduces
the amount of physical memory available to the rest of the system. It
can't be emphasized enough how very important it is to be frugal with
kernel memory.
</p><p>
Although, as mentioned earlier, the assembler (and consequently the
binary) is language agnostic, it's important to consider the third point
mentioned above. C++ is a little more runtime-library intensive than C.
Certain low-level language primitives are partially implemented in a
runtime library that is statically linked automatically with user space
apps. The assembly output will have calls to these functions embedded
when needed. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
throw 2;
</pre><p>
produces the following code on Intel (I've condensed it a bit):
</p><pre class="programlisting asm">
pushl   %ebx
pushl   $4
call    __eh_alloc
addl    $4,%esp
movl    %eax,%ebx
movl    $2,(%ebx)
pushl   $0
call    __tfi
pushl   %eax
pushl   %ebx
call    __cp_push_exception
addl    $12,%esp
call    __throw
movl    -4(%ebp),%ebx
</pre><p>
The functions <code class="function">__eh_alloc</code>, <code class="function">__tfi</code>,
<code class="function">__cp_push_exception</code>, and <code class="function">__throw</code> are
implemented in a library. On Intel, this library is called <code class="filename">libgcc.a</code>.
Also, certain C++ specific initializations are done when an image is
loaded. The initialization code is implemented in <code class="filename">crt0.o</code>. These modules
are linked into user space apps automatically. However, neither of these
libraries gets linked into a driver. They can't, because they make
assumptions about being in user space. Some important C++ features that
are dependent on this runtime library support are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Exceptions
</p></li><li><p>
Run time type information (RTTI); this includes <code class="function">dynamic_cast</code> and
<code class="function">typeinfo</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">new</code> and <code class="function">delete</code>
</p></li><li><p>
The handler for <code class="function">pure_virtual()</code>
</p></li><li><p>
Static object instantiation
</p></li></ol></div><p>
There are two ways to work around the absence of these functions. One
could avoid using the feature, or reimplement it in the driver in a
kernel-friendly way. The latter can be more work, so consider carefully
before embarking on this path. The runtime library is shipped with the
compiler and statically linked into executables. Thus, if your driver
runs on both platforms, you'll potentially have to implement the same
feature for both Metrowerks and GCC, which usually differ in
implementation. Worse, if some compiler implementation changed in some
subtle way, in order to compile the driver with the new compiler,
implementation of these runtime functions would have to be updated.
</p><p>
It's probably best to avoid exceptions, for example. The current
exception implementation on GCC generates a lot of large static tables
when exceptions are enabled, and can increase the binary size
significantly. I've seen increases of around 25% with exceptions enabled,
and that's even if you never use them. As mentioned earlier, kernel
memory is a precious resource, not to be taken for granted. Also, the
effects of uncaught exceptions propagating out of your code and into the
kernel proper are fatal. Besides, implementing the stack unwinding code
in your driver would take a fair amount of work and be tedious to debug.
</p><p>
<code class="function">new</code> and <code class="function">delete</code> are arguably important C++ features, and you'll
probably want to implement them. Luckily, the compiler gives you an easy
(and relatively portable) way to do this, by treating them as global
operators. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="function">operator new</code>(<span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="parameter">size</code>, <span class="type">const nothrow_t&amp;</span>)
     throw() { return <code class="function">malloc</code>(<code class="parameter">size</code>); }

<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="function">operator new</code>[](<span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="parameter">size</code>, <span class="type">const nothrow_t&amp;</span>)
     throw() { return <code class="function">malloc</code>(<code class="parameter">size</code>); }

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">operator delete</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ptr</code>) { <code class="function">free</code>(<code class="parameter">ptr</code>); }

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">operator delete</code>[](<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">ptr</code>) { <code class="function">free</code>(<code class="parameter">ptr</code>); }
</pre><p>
Note the use of <code class="code">nothrow</code>. This is defined in the
<code class="filename">new</code> header. This is
important for handling out of memory conditions. You'll need to call new
like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="classname">SomeClass</code> *<code class="varname">obj</code> = new (nothrow) <code class="classname">SomeClass</code>;
if (<code class="varname">obj</code> == 0)
    <span class="comment">// handle this politely</span>
</pre><p>
This version of new will generate code to check that the returned pointer
is not <code class="constant">NULL</code> before calling your constructor or setting vtable pointers
(which occurs before your constructor is invoked). You'll have to check
to see if the result is <code class="constant">NULL</code> anywhere that you call new and handle it
properly.
</p><p>
Note also that if you have instance variables that are objects, you must
be very careful to check and make sure they initialize properly. This is
very subtle, but very important.
</p><p>
The handler for pure_virtual is just a C function. It can be implemented
simply as
</p><pre class="programlisting">
extern "C" <span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">pure_virtual</code>() { panic("pure virtual
function call"); }
</pre><p>
This generally only happens when something is really hosed anyway, say,
if you've trashed memory. But you'll get a linker error if you don't
include it.
</p><p>
Finally, if you have declare global instances in your driver, their
constructors will *not* be called (ever). It's probably not a good idea
to do this anyway, as initialization order in a driver is generally
important, and it is fragile to depend on the compiler to initialize
things in a predefined order. It's cleanest and most prudent to
explicitly instantiate everything.
</p><p>
It's important to mention that we often use a two- component driver model
in BeOS, where a user level add-on lives in a server, with a smaller
portion in the kernel. It's generally better to put all your C++ in the
user level add-on and write a thin driver in C to bang registers and
handle interrupts. This model can be faster (as you can perform certain
operations on the driver without having to enter the kernel), more memory
friendly (because the code in user space is swappable), and more stable,
because bugs in the user level add-on are potentially less fatal.
</p><p>
As you can see, writing a driver in C++ is more complex than writing one
in C. The official Be-sanctioned practice is to write drivers in C,
keeping them small and simple. However, it's important to understand the
issues involved.

Over the years, Be tech writers and engineers have produced a substantial
amount of prose and sample code on the subject of drivers for the BeOS.
Really. The problem is that it's not so easy to find it all.

Enter the BeOS Driver FAQs, which will give you a crib sheet that should
provide concise answers to your basic questions and serve as a launching
pad for your deeper explorations of the BeOS driver universe. This
document is making its initial appearance here in the Newsletter, but
will soon go to live in the Be Book's "Drivers" section

In general, a driver is software that directly controls a hardware
device, and may also provide an interface to the device for higher level
software.
</p><p>
In BeOS parlance, a driver is one of three types of kernel add-ons. The
other two are modules and file systems. As add-ons, drivers, modules, and
file systems can be loaded and unloaded by the kernel as needed at
runtime.

The driver binaries that ship with BeOS live in
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin</code>.
Driver binaries provided by third parties should be placed in
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/</code> because the
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/</code> hierarchy should not be modified.
</p><p>
For access from user space, the driver is published in the appropriate
locations in the <code class="filename">/dev</code> hierarchy.
<code class="filename">/dev</code> is managed by the devfs file
system. For more information on devfs and how drivers are published in
the <code class="filename">/dev</code> hierarchy, see the section "devfs"
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/DeviceDrivers_Introduction-2.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs">DeviceDrivers_Introduction.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs</a> in
"Device Drivers" in the Be Book.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id837177"></a><a id="id837180"></a>Q:</td><td><p>What is the driver API?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Drivers must implement the API declared in
<code class="filename">drivers/Drivers.h</code>, which has
two parts. One part is used by devfs
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/DeviceDrivers_Introduction-2.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs">DeviceDrivers_Introduction.html#DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs</a> to manage the
driver and publish it in the
<code class="filename">/dev</code> hierarchy. This part consists of the
following exported symbols:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="function">init_hardware()</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Called when the system is booted, to let the driver detect and reset the
hardware.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="function">init_driver()</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Called when the driver is loaded, so it can allocate needed system
resources.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="function">uninit_driver()</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Called just before the driver is unloaded, so it can free allocated
resources.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="function">publish_devices()</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Called to obtain a list of device names supported by the driver.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="function">find_device()</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Called to obtain a list of pointers to the hook functions for a specified
device.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">api_version</code></span></p></td><td><p>
This exported value tells the kernel what version of the driver API it
was written to, and should always be set to <code class="constant">B_CUR_DRIVER_API_VERSION</code> in
your source code.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Only devfs should call the above functions. So how does other code in
kernel space or user space manipulate the driver? Via the second part of
the driver API, which is a set of hook functions (the set returned from
<code class="function">find_devices()</code>) that maps directly to the familiar posix file-handling
functions <code class="function">open()</code>, <code class="function">close()</code>,
<code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, <code class="function">ioctl()</code>, etc. The full set of
hooks can be seen in the <span class="type">device_hooks</span> structure defined in
<code class="filename">drivers/Drivers.h</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
    <span class="type">device_open_hook</span> <code class="varname">open</code>;
    <span class="type">device_close_hook</span> <code class="varname">close</code>;
    <span class="type">device_free_hook</span> <code class="varname">free</code>;
    <span class="type">device_control_hook</span> <code class="varname">control</code>;
    <span class="type">device_read_hook</span> <code class="varname">read</code>;
    <span class="type">device_write_hook</span> <code class="varname">write</code>;
    <span class="type">device_select_hook</span> <code class="varname">select</code>;
    <span class="type">device_deselect_hook</span> <code class="varname">deselect</code>;
    <span class="type">device_readv_hook</span> <code class="varname">readv</code>;
    <span class="type">device_writev_hook</span> <code class="varname">writev</code>;
} <span class="type">device_hooks</span>;
</pre><p>
Thus you can manipulate a driver from kernel or user space by using the
API defined in <code class="filename">unistd.h</code> and
<code class="filename">fcntl.h</code> on its entry in the
<code class="filename">/dev</code>
hierarchy.
</p><p>
Some drivers may also implement a third kind of API: standard opcodes for
the control hook function (which maps to <code class="function">ioctl()</code>).
<code class="filename">drivers/Drivers.h</code>
defines some fairly generic opcodes your device can support if it makes
sense, such as <code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code> and <code class="constant">B_EJECT_DEVICE</code>. Arve describes
these opcodes as of R4.5 in his article, "<a class="xref" href="Issue4-32.html#Engineering4-32-2" title="Be Engineering Insights: Common ioctls and Error codes for Drivers">Be Engineering Insights: Common ioctls and Error codes for Drivers</a>.
</p><p>
There are also suites of opcodes that must be supported by devices
wishing to conform to specific Be protocols. For example, a driver that
wants to be compatible with the multichannel audio media node discussed
in Jon Watte's article "<a class="xref" href="Issue4-49.html#Engineering4-49" title="Be Engineering Insights: Do You Have 24 Ears?">Be Engineering Insights: Do You Have 24 Ears?</a>" needs to support the
opcodes defined in <code class="filename">multi_audio.h</code>.
This header file has not yet been
finalized, but if you would like to work with a preliminary version of
it, send a note to trinity@be.com.

A module is a kernel add-on that exports an API for use by drivers or
other modules. This API cannot be accessed from user space. A module is
useful for providing services to a class of similar devices so that each
device's driver does not have to implement those services independently.
Modules can also provide services to other modules.

Every binary in the <code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/</code>
hierarchy except the binaries in
<code class="filename">drivers/</code> and
<code class="filename">file_systems/</code> is a module.
</p><p>
For example, in
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/bus_managers/</code> you'll
find usb. This is the USB manager module. It exports an API declared in
<code class="filename">drivers/USB.h</code>
which implements useful functions just about every USB
device driver will need, such as <code class="function">install_notify()</code> and
<code class="function">get_device_descriptor()</code>.
</p><p>
On its backend, the USB manager interfaces with another example of a
module—a bus module—which knows the implementation details of a
particular USB host controller. For example,
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/busses/usb/uhci</code> is the bus module that
knows how to work with UHCI-compliant USB host controllers. Thus
individual USB device drivers can be written to one API and yet work with
potentially many different USB host controllers. For more information on
bus managers, see Arve's article, "<a class="xref" href="Issue3-20.html#Engineering3-20" title="Be Engineering Insights: Splitting Device Drivers and Bus Managers">Be Engineering Insights: Splitting Device Drivers and Bus Managers</a>"

</p><p>
Another example of a module is the Atomizer, which implements a virtual
device that returns a unique token for a null- terminated UTF8 string. In
this case, a module is being used not to support hardware devices, but to
extend the logical feature set of the kernel. For more information on the
Atomizer module, see Trey Boudreau's article,

Call <code class="function">get_module()</code> to get a structure that has the module's info and
pointers to its hook functions. Call <code class="function">put_module()</code> when you're done.
Modules are ref-counted, so if you're the last remaining client, the
module will be unloaded from memory when you call <code class="function">put_module()</code>.

Here's a quick chunk of sample code that demonstrates how to use the PCI
bus module to see if your device is on the bus:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;drivers/PCI.h&gt;

<span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">pci_name</code>[] = <code class="constant">B_PCI_MODULE_NAME</code>;

<span class="type">pci_info</span> <code class="varname">info</code>;

<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">ix</code> = 0;

if (<code class="function">get_module</code>(<code class="varname">pci_name</code>, (<span class="type">module_info **</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">pci</code>) != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
    <span class="comment">// handle error</span>
}

while ((*<code class="varname">pci</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">get_nth_pci_info</code>)(<code class="varname">ix</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">info</code>) == <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
    if (<code class="varname">info</code>.<code class="varname">vendor_id</code> == <code class="constant">YOUR_VENDOR_ID</code> &amp;&amp;
        <code class="varname">info</code>.<code class="varname">device_id</code> == <code class="constant">YOUR_DEVICE_ID</code>) {
        <span class="comment">// device is on the bus</span>
    }
    <code class="varname">ix</code>++;
}

<code class="function">put_module</code>(<code class="varname">pci_name</code>);

All public module API headers are found in

Here are some examples:

Bus Managers
PCI: <code class="filename">PCI.h</code>
ISA: <code class="filename">ISA.h</code>
SCSI (via Common Access Method): <code class="filename">CAM.h</code>

Module sample code is mixed in with the driver sample code at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/drivers&gt;, although it should get its own
directory soon. <code class="filename">atomizer.zip</code> and <code class="filename">xyz5038.zip</code> are good starting points,
while <code class="filename">buslogic.zip</code> and <code class="filename">symbios.zip</code> contain working bus modules for actual
SCSI controllers.
