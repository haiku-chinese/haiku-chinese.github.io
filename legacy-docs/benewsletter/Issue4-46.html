"Be creates software platforms that enable rich media and web experiences
on personal computers and Internet appliances."
</p><p>
You've probably seen statements similar to this many times during the
last few months. In engineering terms, the last two words—"Internet
appliances"—imply a new and significant constraint: memory footprint.
This is because many Internet appliances have no hard disk. Rather, they
have only a small, compact flash, usually with an IDE interface, and only
a limited amount of memory. Typically, this means 16-32MB of main memory,
and 8-16MB of storage space, at least for devices trying to be much more
than a cellular phone, text-based Web browser. As you can imagine, swap
space isn't even an option with devices such as these.
</p><p>
One consequence is that, more than ever, you need to be careful about
memory usage. Unfortunately, this is often difficult to measure, since
things can be shared by multiple teams or hidden by VM or heap
fragmentation. Also, there are two types of memory allocation: visible
and hidden. Visible memory allocation stores user data (like the buffer
of a Bitmap, the messages of a MessageQueue, the points of a Polygon, and
so on). Hidden memory allocation is used by BeOS objects and components
themselves, so you don't really know what's there. And that's what this
article is about—measuring the memory footprint of empty objects, or
how much does it cost to set up a mechanism even before sending any data
through it...
</p><p>
But enough talk, here are the numbers (tested under R4.5):
</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;less than 16 bytes range&gt;
1 or 2 byte(s) per 1K for areas:
VM maps each 4KB page using a 4 byte value. For very large areas, a
second word may also be allocated for virtual page info (some are
preallocated at boot time).

&lt;16 to 32 bytes range&gt;
creating a <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>
creating an empty <code class="classname">BPolygon</code>

&lt;32 to 64 bytes range&gt;
creating a port
creating a semaphore with short names (&lt;= 15 chars)
creating a <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> filtering a single command code
creating a <code class="classname">BFont</code>

&lt;64 to 128 bytes range&gt; creating a semaphore with long names (&lt;= 31
chars): as a general comment, long names are not free (no miracles here)
creating a <code class="classname">BHandler</code>
creating an empty <code class="classname">BPicture</code>
creating an empty <code class="classname">BMessageQueue</code>
creating an empty <code class="classname">BShape</code>
creating a <code class="classname">BLocker</code>: please notice it's a bit more expensive than a
semaphore. Not a big issue if you don't use a lot of them...
creating an empty <code class="classname">BMessage</code>

&lt;128 to 256 bytes range&gt;
~150 bytes: creating an empty <code class="classname">BRegion</code>

&lt;256 to 512 bytes range&gt;
~350 bytes: creating a bitmap (not accepting view), not counting the
buffer itself
~375 bytes: creating an area (not including the 4 bytes per 4K page
previously discussed)

&lt;1KB to 2KB range&gt;
~1600 bytes: creating a view
~1750 bytes: creating a view and setting a font context. As you can see,
the font context on the server side is optional and gets added lazily.

&lt;16KB and more...&gt;
~16 1/4 K: spawning a thread. At this point, the main hit is the kernel
stack (16K of locked memory).
~20 1/4 K: spawning and resuming a thread. At this point, the thread
starts to use another 4K page for the user stack.
~20 3/4 K: creating and running a <code class="classname">BLooper</code>. That's essentially the cost of
having a thread waiting to dispatch messages.
~32 K: creating a bitmap accepting view, not counting the buffer itself.
Most of it is used by the thread on the server side handling the drawing
commands. That's also the reason why you can't have too many bitmap
accepting views (the app_server team runs out of thread).
~34 K: creating a window, without running the looper. This only creates
one of the two threads required by a fully functional window.
~37 K: creating a TCP socket. This includes a server side thread and some
buffers.
~56 K: creating a window and running the looper by hand (you don't need
to do that usually). In this case, we effectively created both threads
(client and server sides). The rest (around 15K) is used by the client
and server side structs.
~70 K: creating a window, and showing it (outside the display area). As
you see, the memory footprint of the window jumps again one more time. At
this point the window is ready to go, but nothing is drawn on the screen
yet...
~79 K: creating a new team (doing nothing, linking against none of the
shared libraries except libroot). It's essentially:
~32K for the MMU tables
~20K for the thread
~16K for loader structures
~8K for team

~214 K: creating a new team with a <code class="classname">BApplication</code> object, but doing nothing
else but initialization. As expected, the <code class="classname">BApplication</code> is a fairly
respectable beast. Not very surprising, as it includes a couple of
threads, needs a relocated copy of parts of libbe, and provides many
services.
</pre><p>
Remember, these numbers don't include whatever memory will be used by the
objects once you start using them (and that can be a lot, depending on
what you do).

If you've ever ported a large UNIX application to BeOS you may have run
into the problem of building shared library versions of a set of
interdependent static libraries. One way to do this is to build a
shareable file for each library that contains only the exported symbols
of that library. The symbol files can be used to link the other shared
libraries in the set.
</p><p>
Here is a bash script that automates the process. It takes a list of <code class="filename">.a</code>
files and builds a corresponding <code class="filename">.so</code> file for each one. The only thing
missing from this listing is the <code class="function">extract_symbols</code> function, which is
described later.
</p><pre class="programlisting sh">
TMP_DIR=/tmp/so-builder.$$
GCC_ARGS=-nostart

while [ $# != 0 ]
do
  case "$1" in
    -*) GCC_ARGS="$GCC_ARGS $1";;

  gcc $GCC_ARGS -o ${arch%.a}.so *.o $SYMBOLS
  rm -f *.o
done


popd
rm -rf $TMP_DIR
</pre><p>
The <code class="code">while</code> loop scans the shell arguments, putting an absolute path to
each <code class="filename">.a</code> file in <code class="envar">$ARCHIVES</code>. The rest of the arguments are passed to the
gcc command which builds the <code class="filename">.so</code> files.
</p><p>
In a temporary directory, the first <code class="code">for</code> loop builds a symbol file for
each archive by compiling the result of the <code class="function">extract_symbols</code> function. The
  -soname  argument to the linker provides the name of
the <code class="filename">.so</code> file in which the symbols will ultimately be found.
</p><p>
The second <code class="code">for</code> loop relinks each archive into a shared library using
the symbol files just created.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">extract_symbols</code> function takes an archive and creates an assembler
file which contains only symbols. One way to do that is to use a <span class="application">sed</span>
script on the output of <span class="application">nm</span>:
</p><pre class="programlisting sh">
extract_symbols () {
  nm $1 | sed -n '

In this week's installment I intend to put a certain small function in
the Be API to rest. Although it was created with the best of intentions,
there are several subtle problems with its use, so we're deprecating it.
By describing these problems in detail, I hope to illustrate some of the
pitfalls of C++ syntax that may be haunting your code.
</p><p>
Our victim for solemn interment today is <code class="classname">BMessage</code>::<code class="methodname">BMessage</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>*).
</p><p>
Now, ever since the good old days, this function has lurked in the shadow
of its more hygienic partner, the standard <code class="classname">BMessage</code> copy constructor:
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>::<code class="methodname">BMessage</code>(const <code class="classname">BMessage</code>&amp;).
Recall that the copy constructor is called in either of the following two cases:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">a</code>;
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">b</code>(<code class="varname">a</code>);     <span class="comment">// copy constructor specified explicitly</span>
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">c</code> = <code class="varname">a</code>;    <span class="comment">// also calls the copy constructor,</span>
                   <span class="comment">// NOT operator=() !</span>
</pre><p>
This works, looks nice, and is the C++ Approved Way of Doing Things. So
why have a redundant variant that takes a <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span>
instead of a <span class="type">const <code class="classname">BMessage</code>&amp;</span>?
In a word, sloth. Consider the following code that uses the
copy constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MyHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
     <code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">tmpMsg</code>(*<code class="parameter">msg</code>);
     <span class="comment">// do something with tmpMsg</span>
}
</pre><p>
With <code class="methodname">BMessage</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>*) we could get away with this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MyHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
     <code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">tmpMsg</code>(<code class="parameter">msg</code>);
     <span class="comment">// do something with tmpMsg</span>
}
</pre><p>
As you can see, by using the <code class="methodname">BMessage</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>*) constructor, instead of
the widely acclaimed copy constructor, we get one really minimal gain --
we save an asterisk. (Note that dereferencing the pointer here and taking
a reference does not incur a performance penalty, as the compiler can
easily optimize it.) Nevertheless, since much of the Be API centers
around passing pointers to <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s around, it seems the most natural
way to express the copying of one message to another. So, its use is
pandemic in both our code and—I suspect—in many of your apps as
well.
</p><p>
Now, where are the subtle problems I spoke of? First, there is the
question of constness. Since copying a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> does not alter the
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>, we should be able to pass a
<span class="type">const <code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span> into the
constructor. Sadly, though, we overlooked this in the initial
implementation of the <code class="classname">BMessage</code> API, and we can't fix it because of
backwards compatibility issues. So if you have a <span class="type">const</span> <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, you have
to work around this bug in the API by casting away the constness of your
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">const <code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span> <code class="varname">a</code>;
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">b</code>(const_cast&lt;<code class="classname">BMessage</code>*&gt;(a));
</pre><p>
The C++-style cast I've used here looks ugly for a reason: a <code class="code">const_cast</code>
is a potentially dangerous operation, and should not be invoked
carelessly. Because you're bypassing the compiler's enforcement of
constness, you have to blindly trust our claim that the <code class="classname">BMessage</code>
constructor doesn't modify the original message. Because the regular
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> copy constructor handles const correctly, it's much easier to
use in this case.
</p><p>
Secondly, there are a couple of cases where a subtle error in your code
will result in an unwanted side effect which is difficult to debug.
First, there is the following code:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">msg</code> = new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>;
</pre><p>
In this case, I forgot to type an asterisk, and would hope that the
compiler would catch the error. But not only does this code compile, it
seems to run fine!
</p><p>
Why does this compile? It compiles because initialization invokes the
copy constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">msg</code>(new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>);
</pre><p>
There are two undesirable results of this code:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
There is a redundant copy of data from the message on the heap
to <code class="varname">msg</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
The pointer to the message you just created goes out of scope
when the constructor exits, meaning that you've just leaked memory.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
If this wasn't bad enough, things get even worse. There is also the
possibility of unwanted implicit conversions.
</p><p>
As a quick review of implicit conversions, recall that a constructor with
a single argument defines an implicit conversion from the argument type
to the class type. For example, you can define a conversion from a <span class="type">double</span>
to a complex number in the following manner:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <code class="classname">Complex</code> {
     <code class="methodname">Complex</code>(<span class="type">double</span> <code class="parameter">aReal</code>) : <span class="type">real</span>(<code class="parameter">aReal</code>), <span class="type">imag</span>(0.0) {}
     <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">real</code>;
     <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">imag</code>;
};
</pre><p>
Then, you can write the following:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">double</span> mag(<span class="type">Complex</span> <code class="parameter">c</code>)
{
     return sqrt(<code class="parameter">c</code>.<code class="varname">real</code>*<code class="parameter">c</code>.<code class="varname">real</code> + <code class="parameter">c</code>.<code class="varname">imag</code>*<code class="parameter">c</code>.<code class="varname">imag</code>);
}

<span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">a</code>;
<span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">aMag</code> = mag(<code class="varname">a</code>);
</pre><p>
because the <span class="type">double</span> will automatically be converted into a <code class="classname">Complex</code> object
for you.
</p><p>
Let's say we have the following function which takes a reference to
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> and modifies the message:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">FillMessage</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>&amp; <code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
     <code class="varname">msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddString</code>("password", "metatron");
}
</pre><p>
But when we use this function, we forget that it takes
a reference, and we pass it a pointer instead:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="varname">myMsg</code> = new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>;
<code class="methodname">FillMessage</code>(<code class="varname">myMsg</code>);
</pre><p>
Again, this is probably a simple typo in your code, and you'd want this
code to refuse to compile. But before the compiler rejects this code, it
will look for some way to turn your <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span>
into a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>&amp;. It can't
do this directly, but it can turn a <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span>
into a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, and then
it can create a reference to a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> from this resulting object. This
would be the same as writing:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="varname">myMsg</code> = new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>;
<code class="methodname">FillMessage</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>(<code class="varname">myMsg</code>));
</pre><p>
So, the code will compile and run with nary a complaint. The subtle and
dangerous problem with this conversion, as the latter piece of code
illustrates, is that you are creating a reference to a temporarily
constructed <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, NOT the original message itself. <code class="methodname">FillMessage</code> ends
up modifying a temporary <code class="classname">BMessage</code> that gets thrown away, and the original
message is left untouched. This is almost certainly not what you want!
</p><p>
Both this problem and the memory leak could be solved by declaring the
constructor to be <code class="code">explicit</code>. With the proper constness declared, this
would look something like:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BMessage</code> {
public:
     explicit <code class="methodname">BMessage</code>(const <code class="classname">BMessage</code>*);
     ...
};
</pre><p>
This prevents the constructor from being used in implicit conversions and
initialization—you have to call the constructor explicitly. However,
between these issues, the <code class="code">const</code> issue, and redundancy, we chose to
deprecate this constructor instead.

We're bound to run into questions, some teasing, and the odd bit of
trouble. One question I'm often asked is how the name came to Be. (I
forgot to mention feeble puns in the preceding list.) When Steve Sakoman
and I started the company, I wanted to call it UT, as in the music note
the Latin conjunction... and as in United Technoids. Steve was his usual
diplomatic self, not voicing such thoughts as "here we go again."
Instead, he offered to investigate other options by looking through the
dictionary with his kids over the weekend.
</p><p>
The following Monday, I called Steve from the road. How did it go? We
stopped at "be," he said. The letter "b," I asked? No, "to be," he
replied. And that was it. We looked for conflicting names and, to our
surprise, found none we thought might be troublesome. I fired up MacDraw
II and typed the two letters of the logo in 72-pt. Times Roman. The
spacing between the "B" and the "e" looked awful. However, by typing each
letter as a separate object and using the left cursor key, I was able to
arrange the letters just so, and we had our first logo.
</p><p>
As for name conflicts, we'd been a little too sanguine. One company,
Better Education, used its initials publicly. We visited them and reached
an amicable arrangement. We'd chosen Be Labs for our legal name, because
it sounded good to us. Bell Labs agreed that it sounded good; in fact,
they thought it sounded too close to their former, prestigious name. We
deferred, particularly since we didn't want a misunderstanding at a time
when we were working with AT&amp;T's Hobbit microprocessor. So Be
Incorporated became our legal name and we kept Be for our logo and
"common" name.
</p><p>
Naturally, we want to protect the value of our name, of our brand. This
is a lot easier with a name like Exxon or Hewlett-Packard than with a
word as common as "Be." If you call your windows replacement business
Better Windows, chances are the Redmond company will leave you alone. But
if you start a Windows management software company, or, worse, a Windows
management utility business, calling it Better Windows could get you into
trouble. Apple, for example, has had no end of trouble dealing with the
use of "Mac" in the names of products, services, magazines, newsletters,
stores...
</p><p>
Popularity is not a bad problem to have though, and on a smaller scale,
we see good news in the occasional problematic use of our name. (Osborne
has no such trouble.) Recently, we came to an amiable arrangement with
BeComputing. The name was obviously meant to indicate support of the Be
platform, but there was a problem with the perception it could create.
BeDepot is part of Be, Inc., but what about BeComputing? In fact, it's
not affiliated with us.
</p><p>
Fortunately, Eric Schlissel, the CEO of BeComputing, understood our
concern. That is, confusion, in one way or another, lowers the value of
the brand. This, in turn, hurts everyone associated with the platform --
probably what sages mean when they speak of "brand equity." BeComputing
will rename itself Geek Teknologies. We appreciate their understanding of
our efforts as well as their support of the Be platform.
