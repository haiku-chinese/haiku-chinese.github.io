The Node Monitor is a new service that will accompany the DR9 file
system. It lets your application ask to be notified when certain changes
are made to a file or directory. For example, you can "watch for" the
creation and deletion of files within a directory, for the modification
of a specific file's attributes or name, and so on.
</p><p>
As a built-in feature of the file system, the Node Monitor is part of the
kernel: It's always there. However, it's anticipated that most
applications won't need the Node Monitor; watching the state of the file
system is important to servers and to navigational applications like the
Tracker, but your Tetris killer—or even your Excel insulter --
probably isn't going to care.
</p><p>
The Node Monitor is, in our estimation, an advanced feature; the API for
the Monitor is, suitably, rather low level—it's not downright
unfriendly, but it does have a somewhat more mechanical view of the
identity of files, as we're about to see.
</p><p>
CAVEAT: The API that we'll be looking at throughout this article isn't
set in stone. Although the general concepts should remain valid, some of
the names may change before DR9 is released.
</p><p>
To tell the Node Monitor that you want to watch for changes, you use the
global watch_for() function:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">watch_for</code>(<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <span class="type">dev_t</span> <code class="parameter">device</code>, <span class="type">ino_t</span> <code class="parameter">inode</code>,
  <span class="type">const<code class="classname">BHandler</code> *</span><code class="parameter">handler</code>, <span class="type">const<code class="classname">BLooper</code> *</span><code class="parameter">looper</code>);
</pre><p>
The file or directory (or "node") that you're watching is represented by
the combination of the function's device and inode arguments. (Conversion
between device/inode and the <span class="type">entry_ref</span> structure/C++ objects, which were
described in last week's Newsletter, will be provided by the Storage Kit.)
</p><p>
The activities that you're interested in watching are represented by the
constants that you pass through the flags argument:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_WATCH_NAME</code> means you want to be told whenever the node is renamed.
This includes being moved to a new directory.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_WATCH_STAT</code> watches for changes to the stat structure. This is the
structure that records a node's size, creation and modification dates,
permissions, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_WATCH_ATTR</code> watches for changes to the node's attributes. (See Be
Newsletter #51 for more on attributes.)
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_WATCH_DIRECTORY</code> watches for any changes to the list of files that a
directory contains. In other words, it watches for files that are added
to or removed from the directory. Obviously, this flag only applies to
directory nodes.
</p></li></ul><p>
The special flag <code class="constant">B_STOP_WATCHING</code> can be passed to stop watching the node.
</p><p>
When a change is detected, the Node Monitor generates a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> and
sends it to the "watcher" (a <code class="classname">BHandler</code> object) that's specified in the
<code class="function">watch_for()</code> call. The watcher receives the message in its
<code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code> function. (The Node Monitor divines the target from the
handler and looper arguments through a series of logical steps that are
really not very interesting.)
</p><p>
Each of the watched-for flags corresponds to a particular type of
message: <code class="constant">B_WATCH_NAME</code> generates a <code class="constant">B_ENTRY_MOVED</code>
message, <code class="constant">B_WATCH_STAT</code>
generates <code class="constant">B_STAT_CHANGED</code>, and so on. We'll look at an example of the
Monitor's messaging later in this article.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551772"></a>Monitor Vs. Live Queries</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">Tres bien</em></span>, you dit to yourself,
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">mais, comment c'est en mieux a la
'Querie Vif!' en DRHuit?</em></span> ("How is this better than DR8's live queries?")
</p><p>
True, you could "watch" changes to files and directories in DR8 by
installing a live query with the Storage Server—this is how the
Browser kept its folder windows in synch with the file system, for
example. But a live query can (or could) only watch for changes to fields
in the database tables that represent the items in the file system. In
other words, this sort of monitoring worked because certain file system
parameters (file names, creation dates, and so on) were stored in the
database. But in DR9 we're going start supporting foreign file systems,
and these file systems (HFS and DOS, for starters) don't know anything
about Be-native database facilities. Thus, a live query can't work on a
foreign file.
</p><p>
This is where the Node Monitor can be useful: It's a "universal" service
for spying on files and directories in any file system. Some file systems
may not provide complete snoopage; it's likely that you won't be able to
monitor attribute changes in DOS simply because DOS doesn't know about
attributes. But one of the line items in the contract for becoming a
"File System Handler" is that stat and directory-content information MUST
be emulated. In other words, the DOS file system handler knows how to
fake a stat structure. Thus, you'll be able to, at least, watch for
changes to the arrangement of files in any mountable file system.
</p><p>
Note that the Node Monitor isn't a replacement for live queries. But
neither are live queries going away: In DR9, you'll have the best of both
worlds.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551806"></a>Example (Print Server)</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let's consider an application that uses the Node Monitor: the Print
Server. When you print, the data that you're printing is written to a
"spool file." It's the Print Server's responsibility to:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Detect the presence of a new spool file.
</p></li><li><p>
Wait for the file's "status" attribute to change to "waiting" (this
indicates that the file is ready to be printed).
</p></li><li><p>
Change the status to "printing" and print the file.
</p></li></ul><p>
Spool files are always written to a known spool directory; to detect new
spool files, the Print Server asks the Node Monitor to inform it of new
entries in this directory:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">PrintServer</code>::<code class="methodname">PrintServer</code>() : <code class="classname">BApplication</code>('PRNT')
{
  <span class="type">dev_t</span> <code class="varname">spoolDevice</code>;
  <span class="type">ino_t</span> <code class="varname">spoolInode</code>;

  <span class="comment">// Get the device and inode of the spool directory</span>
  <code class="function">get_inode_for_path</code>("/boot/system/spool", &amp;<code class="varname">spoolDevice</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">spoolInode</code>);

  <span class="comment">// Start watching for new files in that directory.</span>
  <span class="comment">// The final two arguments tell the Monitor to send</span>
  <span class="comment">// notifications to this object's preferred handler.</span>
  <code class="function">watch_for</code>(<code class="constant">B_WATCH_DIRECTORY</code>, <code class="varname">spoolDevice</code>, <code class="varname">spoolInode</code>, <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="varname">this</code>);

  <span class="comment">// We're also going to need another looper later.</span>
  <code class="varname">fStatusWatcher</code> = new <code class="classname">StatusWatcher</code>();
  ...
}
</pre><p>
When a spool file is created, a <code class="constant">B_ENTRY_CREATED</code> message is sent to
PrintServer's main loop. The <code class="varname">what</code> for Node Monitor messages is always
<code class="constant">B_FS_NOTIFICATION</code>. The Monitor message type is in the <code class="varname">opcode</code> field:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="classname">PrintServer</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
{
  <span class="type">dev_t</span> <code class="varname">fileDevice</code>;
    <span class="type">ino_t</span> <code class="varname">fileInode</code>;

  switch (<code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code>) {
  . . .

  case <code class="constant">B_FS_NOTIFICATION</code>:
    switch(<code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindLong</code>("opcode")) {

    case <code class="constant">B_ENTRY_CREATED</code>:
      <span class="comment">// Get the device and inode for the file;</span>
      <span class="comment">// these are stored in the message.</span>
      <code class="varname">fileDevice</code> = <code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindLong</code>("device");
      <code class="varname">fileInode</code> = <code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindLong</code>("node");
</pre><p>
At this point, the Server knows the identity (as a device/inode) of the
new spool file. Now it waits for the "status" attribute to change to
"waiting" by asking for an attribute-has-changed notification. Obviously,
the Server has to find a different watcher for these notifications --
that's why we defined the <code class="varname">fStatusWatcher</code> object:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
      <code class="function">watch_for</code>(<code class="constant">B_WATCH_ATTR</code>, <code class="varname">fileDevice</code>, <code class="varname">fileInode</code>, <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="varname">fStatusWatcher</code>);
      . . .
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>
(Note: There's a race condition in this code: What happens if the spool
file is already "waiting" when the first notification is processed? The
solution is left as an exercise for the reader.)
</p><p>
Over in the <code class="classname">StatusWatcher</code> handler, we find...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">long</span> <code class="classname">StatusWacher</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)

      <code class="methodname">SendToPrinter</code>(<code class="varname">spoolFile</code>);
      . . .
</pre><p>
Again, remember that the file system API is still subject to change, so
don't start porting your code on the basis of the names shown here.

The early adopters and developers on a new OS platform exhibit behavior
that might be considered obsessive and irrational. When I first received
my <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ last year, I couldn't help but read every shred of
information available in the newsgroups, and I hungered for e-mail
exchanges with like-minded folks. I longed for new web sites and new
software on any ftp site.
</p><p>
This hunger and desire reaches a fevered pitch as a 'release' date
approaches. DR5, DR6, DR7... Well, it's been a long time since a release,
and DR8.2 for many has been the first release. Not wanting anyone to
burst a blood vessel waiting for their next fix, we've decided to release
DR8.3. This is really just a maintenance release and doesn't offer any
new functionality. You'll find all the details about this release on our
Web site this week. The general gist is, this release is for the Power
Mac only, not for the BeBox (BeOS for BeBox does not have the limitations
that DR8.3 removes).
</p><p>
In DR8.2, the font renderer had a limited license that required us to
have a termination date, past which the OS wouldn't operate. We've
changed font providers, and this requirement has been removed.
</p><p>
Serial support wasn't included in the DR8.2 CD that shipped with MacTech.
This release includes it.
</p><p>
There may also be a few more bug fixes, but that was not the purpose of
this release. The long and short of it is, IF YOU'RE RUNNING DR8.2 ON A
POWER MAC, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY INSTALL THIS UPGRADE!!
</p><p>
You don't want to interrupt your endless stream of BeOS fun, so get this
thing and install it immediately!!
</p><p>
Since we're the digital content creation platform of choice for
discriminating artists, I thought I'd throw up some more code of the
digital content variety. There have been quite a few MPEG encoders and
decoders in the air for the BeOS. I thought I'd add the code for the
Berkeley decoder just for fun.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/mpeg_lib.tgz
</p><p>
This library isn't the fastest, or smartest, or highest quality thing in
the world. But the code is understandable, easy to make into a shared
library, and it's free. It should be useful to those who endeavor to do
similar things in the BeOS.
</p><p>
We will continue to provide innovative fresh fertile ground upon which
you can program your heart away. And in the long run, you'll be satisfied
with a job well done, until the next release.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-10"></a>Who's Stupid?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
We are, of course, not the programmer, or the user of our software.
Making your customer feel stupid should be prohibited by the
Constitution, and in any case, generating such feelings is always harmful
to business. Put another way, while we can sometimes be forgiven for
embarrassing mistakes, we won't make friends by generating feelings of
inadequacy, especially if they're followed by a realization that the
mistake was ours in the first place. Hence our decision to post our bugs
on our Web site. Starting with developers, we want to get in the habit of
mapping the minefield as accurately as we can. This will save everyone
time and energy, a good reason to start with. Then, as more eyes see the
range of reported problems, some pattern recognition might take place,
meaning one or more individuals will pick up on a bad habit, or a regular
trap, and share their knowledge with the community. In the same vein, our
example might encourage BeOS application developers to do the same for
their customers—and for the rest of us—with similar benefits.
</p><p>
This is all nice and good, but what about disadvantages? For instance,
will the competition use this against us? Possibly. We might save their
harried Competitive Studies people some time. But nasty bugs end up
reported one way or the other, so we might as well do the reporting
ourselves, thus minimizing distortion. Another possible criticism leveled
at us for posting our bugs is you don't show customers the inside of the
sausage factory. They don't want to know. To this, my answer is that if I
start a sausage factory, I have to make a much better sausage than the
established industrial meat processors. And, assuming I actually make a
better product, I then make a point of seeking out sausage connoisseurs
and taking them through the kitchen. They see the ingredients coming in,
they watch the mixing process... I sense some problems with this kind of
metaphor, the penalty, I guess for venturing out of my usual range.
Still, many great restaurants feature a visible kitchen. For us, letting
light in on our OS-making process is a healthy constraint. We'll be
embarrassed on a regular basis, always good for the product and the soul.
And we'll also get more helpful suggestions along the way than if we
didn't open our doors.
</p><p>
Of course, as the bug reports show, we still have a lot to do and a lot
to prove. Ironically, a maturing OS will mean even more bugs reported,
not fewer, as our system gains more flesh and is stressed by more
applications and more users.

More suggestions and discussion of features that are essential—or,
at least, desirable—for a baseline (future backwards-compatible)
release. This week:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Intelligent versioning
</p></li><li><p>
Coalesce view update messages from the app_server (when requested)
</p></li><li><p>
STREAMS support
</p></li><li><p>
Networked BMessages
</p></li><li><p>
UNIX-style man pages
</p></li><li><p>
A well-defined system directory tree
</p></li></ul><p>
There was some debate over STREAMS. Some folks think that BSD sockets
are not only better, but that having two network port models is
confusing.
</p><p>
Obviously, not all of the requests are essential to a baseline customer
release.

AKA: Intel port == bad!<br />
AKA: Dave's Raves
</h5></div></div></div><p>
Was Brad Taylor's article in last week's Newsletter, in which he
described the pitfalls that one should avoid when sending data between
machines that are, potentially, differently byte-ordered, a hint of
ports to come?
</p><p>
This speculation led to a discussion of the history of the
little-endian/big-endian battle of the (byte) sexes. The history lesson
then followed its own logic into the future, which led to general
crystal ball gazing and a fantasy about little brown men that, frankly,
I had trouble following.
</p><p>
We also heard arguments over the desirability of an Intel port. On the
pro side is the thought that general proliferation of the BeOS is a
Good Thing. Con has it that an alliance with Intel would be (for now)
an unnecessary, resource-guzzling distraction. No it wouldn't. Yes it
would.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: As many of you pointed out, Brad Taylor's article was a
sincere tutorial on good network programming practice. No "hints" were

This thread, which sprang from the endian-ness discussion, discussed
the benefits/detriments of "overclocking" (or, more accurately,
"undertiming") the CPU.
</p><p>
Overclocking increases the speed of the CPU beyond its rated limit;
typical overclocking techniques involve soldering a faster oscillator
onto the motherboard (think of it as dangling a bigger carrot in front
of the hamster). It works—but does it decrease the life expectancy
of the chip? Some folks say, "You bet it does."

Various listeners volunteered descriptions of their personal
programming projects (whether actually implemented or not). Among other
things, we heard about...
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A socket server that could be used as the basis for networked
scripting [Jon Ragnarrson]
</p></li><li><p>
A port of socket++ [Howard Berkey]
</p></li><li><p>
A network-playable Stratego game [Ficus Kirkpatrick]
</p></li></ul><p>
Other network ideas:
</p><p>
What about moving the network layer into the kernel? This idea met some
amount of horrified resistance.
</p><p>
Some old favorites, such as picking up an entire executable and sending
it down the wire, were trotted out and banged around.

Looking ahead to subsequent customer releases, will BeOS 2.0 break all
1.0 applications? Would modular libraries (rather than the monolithic
libbe.so) help?
</p><p>
This led to a discussion of relative pathnames in #include directives
and whether "greg" is "bill". Slow week.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: In DR9, libbe WILL be broken into separate libraries. The
divisions will primarily follow the kits.
