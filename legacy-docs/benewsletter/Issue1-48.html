Much has been written, and even more said, about those dark forces from
the Northwest, the evil willies of Redmond. Why does one little software
company evoke such harsh sentiment from almost everyone in the industry
(not to mention the occasional investigation from the Department of
Justice)?
</p><p>
The subject came up again at dinner last night, and I was unsurprised by
the unanimity and depth of feeling. "Unscrupulous bastards," "criminals,"
"lunatics." Round the table we went (myself included), in a game of "top
the epithet." I started to feel sorry for Bill Gates.
</p><p>
But... I've witnessed my share of Microsoft's "interesting behavior." Is
it coincidence that Microsoft announced PenWindows just one day before Go
Corporation announced its PenPoint operating system for portable pen
computers? Microsoft was a key PenPoint developer—Go had even invited
Microsoft to demonstrate their application at the PenPoint rollout. Yet,
somehow, the other half of Microsoft (the system software folks) chose to
repay this kindness by scooping Go with their own PenWindows intro. This
"coincidence" took a little of the steam out of Go's announcement.
</p><p>
Criminal behavior? I wouldn't like it if they did it to my little sister,
but... probably not illegal. Besides, wasn't Go asking for trouble by
inviting the fox into the preproduct introduction henhouse?
</p><p>
I see Microsoft as a remarkably persistent company whose business tactics
are extremely aggressive, bordering on ruthless. They push the limits,
but as any adolescent can tell you: That's What Limits Are There For.
Microsoft has a position of power in this industry that's unparalleled,
and they sometimes abuse it. But it wasn't always this way...
</p><p>
[WAVY LINES ACROSS THE SCREEN; HARP ARPEGGIOS ON THE SOUNDTRACK]
</p><p>
I first worked with Microsoft when they had a single product, a BASIC
interpreter. Not the stuff the world's largest personal fortune is made
of, but it was a good product. It actually worked. Then they made their
second product, a FORTRAN compiler for CP/M. It too was a good product.
It also worked. And it was documented. Again, this may not sound like
much, but it did serve to distinguish the product from its competition.
Microsoft was a scrappy little company (about the size of Be), but it was
just one of a number of scrappy little companies in the microcomputer
language market. In the years before their big break with DOS for the IBM
PC, Microsoft slowly but steadily increased their product line, their
quality and support, and their revenues.
</p><p>
Microsoft first showed a version of Windows in 1983. It was miserable.
Nobody bought it. They regrouped and refined and launched Windows 2.0. It
too was miserable. Nobody bought it. They regrouped and refined and
launched Windows 3.0 in 1990. Better. People started to actually use it.
Refinements known as Windows 3.1 made it a highly successful product.
Once again the traditions of persistence and refinement paid off.
</p><p>
There is a bumper sticker about Macintosh that really bugs me: "Windows
'95 = Macintosh '89."
</p><p>
It's not the logic that bugs me—yes, of course Windows '95 is no
better than Macintosh in 1989. But I want the companion bumper sticker,
which is just as true: "Macintosh '95 = Macintosh '89."
</p><p>
So next time people start complaining about the tactics of Microsoft, I
might be compelled to point out that while Bill Gates is our only modern
example of the robber baron, his company's drive and persistence in
continuously improving their products might also be part of their success.

What is a Technical Evangelist anyway? Well, it's a name that I made up
so that I could fit into this awesome company. A Technical Evangelist is
a person with a lot of engineering experience who has a fire in the belly
to become a marketing type person. The evangelism aspect of the job is to
spread the gospel of the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ as far and wide as possible.
</p><p>
The BeOS provides a platform upon which developers can "do the right
thing." As a company that's interested in longevity, and ready market
acceptance, we're interested in getting software from well-established
companies, but that's not the exciting stuff. What's really exciting are
the offerings of the small developers who take a risk on a new platform
and dare to create something a little bit different from the past—and
often a few levels better.
</p><p>
So, how can a Technical Evangelist help this process? Well... the
Technical Evangelist can write code. A lot of code. The Evangelist can
show developers how easy (or hard) it is to use the system in a
particular way for maximum effect.
</p><p>
In working with NeXT and Taligent, I always pressed hard for good
documentation and sample apps. So I believe this is the best thing for
the BeOS as well.
</p><p>
This week finds us looking at how to support something like Photoshop. We
have a modest application, Rraster! The primary function of this
application is as a replacement for the ImageViewer application, which
comes with the BeOS. I took a look at the ImageViewer code and thought,
"This could be made into a lot better and more useful example."
</p><p>
Rraster! is like ImageViewer in that it lets you drag and drop images on
it to view them. The twist is that it allows you to drag and drop images
of any type! It achieves this by use of add-ons. The interface is easy,
and a GIF and PCX add-on are included. There is a simple add-on manager
that shows how add-ons can be easily supported in any application. I
don't want to spoil all the fun, because this was also the basis for an
upcoming magazine article, but there's a lot of good stuff in here.
</p><p>
The other things you'll see in this sample are how to properly launch an
application and deal with parameters, whether you dragged and dropped
onto the icon, double- clicked a file, or launched it from the command
line. These are mundane issues, but they can be maddening if you can't do
them right.
</p><p>
You can get the code from:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/Rraster.tgz
</p><p>
The add-on support is very basic, and is meant to give you a good idea of
how easy it is to use add-ons. As far as data translation in general is
concerned, you should probably take a look at the DataTypes library by
Jon Watte.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id504968"></a>Tools For You</h3></div></div></div><p>
Writing graphics device drivers is a black art on a good day. If you have
been trying to do this of late, you know what a pain it can be. Well, our
graphics driver person has given me a tool that anyone writing graphics
drivers will probably find useful. The tool allows you to test your
driver like a normal app by hooking it up to an app_server dummy. You can
do source-level debugging without having to reboot all the time, and when
you're done, you can make it a full-blown driver. This is the very tool
that we use ourselves, so you have it as good as we do. If you really
want to get your hands on it, please send e-mail to me (wadams@be.com)
and ask for it. I won't make a general public release, because the code
is not very... pretty. But we'll give it to those who are really
interested in exploring the heart of darkness.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id504978"></a>Rallying The Troops</h3></div></div></div><p>
The BeOS is a fun and exciting operating system to write applications
for. The proof is in the number of applications that show up on our ftp
site every day. Developers at this stage are sharing and cooperating with
each other. This is a good thing and will only serve to make applications
better in the near term rather than later. We're currently creating a
sample CD that will go out to all our demo teams, and thanks to everyone
who sent in code to get on this disk!
</p><p>
More opportunities abound! Comdex is coming, Macworld is coming, and many
more opportunities will give our developers exposure. Keep those apps
coming! The more we can replace our own apps with yours, the better the
BeOS demonstrates. We're in a much better position if we can show
developer applications instead of our own. So keep them coming, we'll put
you in front people's faces.

My primary occupation is as a VLSI design engineer. My responsibilies are
a combination of circuit design and CAD software design and modification.
I've been fascinated with electronics since I was a kid. As I dabbled in
computer programming a few years later, I developed interests in
scientific software tools developement. What I've enjoyed most is the
continuous challenge and the constantly expanding base of knowledge from
which I could learn exciting new ideas.
</p><p>
In the late 80s I closely watched the development of the Amiga computer
system. It was a novel system with many features unmatched in other
systems of the time. A group of friends and I decided that it would be
cool to develop software for this system. We formed a small group that
collaborated on a few small projects. Unfortunately the Amiga entered a
long period of stagnation, and there was no attractive alternative
platform for our varied projects.
</p><p>
Last year we started hearing rumors of the upcoming BeBox. At first we
cautiously stood back and watched Be, Inc. The BeBox and BeOS seemed to
be well thought out. Designed from the ground up, not just for
multitasking, but for multiprocessing. The BeBox also had many nice
standard features, such as SCSI and IDE, PCI and ISA, PowerPC CPUs, and
the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™. (Clearly more than the cheapest common denominator sold
by many other companies.) However, a good product alone is not sufficient.
</p><p>
We wanted to make sure that the company was going to be committed to
developing a strong and unique product, and most important, that it was
willing to commit to helping developers and to pushing the development of
products on the new platform. Be seems to be doing precisely that. They
seem to be willing to accept and support small-time developers. It's
always been my experience that the majority of software used on systems
is not the major applications, but the small additions, utilities, and
tools developed by small developers. It's also these small things that
give a system the general functionality (if not the feel) that makes a
system so great. They also seem to be very open with information about
their system. The major manuals and information about the BeBox and BeOS
all seem to be freely accessible via the Internet.
</p><p>
I feel that developing for the BeBox is a unique oppurtunity. The user
base is clearly a cut above average, for being willing and able to work
with a new system such as this. Further, the market is probably going to
be much more open to new software, users aren't likely to be limiting
themselves to the "I've got the same software as everyone else" attitude.
This will hopefully give not only software my friends and I develop a
better chance of making it off the ground, but should also provide us
with a more diverse set of software and tools for us to choose from to
aid our work.
</p><p>
The BeBox also provides a lower-cost route to parallel processing. I look
forward to investigating parallelizing software algorithms, and
integrating these techniques in more responsive applications. The BeOS
seems much friendlier to multithreaded applications than any other OS
I've worked with.
</p><p>
The BeOS also seems to provide several other unique features that it
would be cool to use. Some of these include the object-oriented approach
used throughout the OS and the integrated file system and database.
</p><p>
Having only been accepted as a Be developer in the last few weeks, I'm
still investigating my options as far what products I (and probably
several of my friends) decide to work on. Numerous ideas I've been
considering include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
Schematic entry utilities
</li><li>
Circuit board layout tools
</li><li>
Circuit analysis programs (both digital and analog)
</li><li>
Mathematic analysis or spreadsheet software
</li><li>
And the old classic... games development
</li></ul><p>
Most likely none of these will be available before the middle of next
year. Most of these are targeted at electrical engineers and hobbyists.
They would probably be released as low-cost commercial packages.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing1-48"></a>Be Marketing Mutterings: Recruiting</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Alex</span> <span class="surname">Osadzinski</span></span></div></div></div><p>
I like bananas. In fact, I like them a lot. I bring a few of these
wonderful fruits to the office every day and my colleagues have probably
noticed that I munch on one sometimes as I wander from cube to cube. I
hope that they don't mind when I absentmindedly drop banana skins into
their waste baskets. I guess I should retain my banana detritus and
dispose of it in the Be kitchen, where it could aid in the evolution of
the strange lifeform that is beginning to write code with pseudopods as
it grows in the refrigerator.
</p><p>
Whether or not my Be colleagues have noted my passion for bananas, I know
someone who definitely has: The management of a hotel in Hong Kong.
</p><p>
Last year, I had the pleasure of visiting Hong Kong eight times, to work
at the Asian HQ of my then employer. On each occasion, having survived
the truly unique final approach and landing to Hong Kong's tired,
overloaded airport, I would present myself at the same hotel's checkin
somewhat worse for wear and ready for bed. The first time I stayed there,
I was greeted professionally and quickly checked in, and my room featured
a little bowl of fruit. During the next 48 hours, I consumed, of course,
the two available bananas but eschewed the kiwi fruit and apples. During
the next seven stays, the level of greeting escalated from the regular
checkin staff through to the manager herself and the bowl of fruit (and
room) grew bigger and, on my last stay, included no less than eight
bananas and a note indicating that more of them were available on request.
</p><p>
Imagine what kind of customer service system notes guests' banana eating
patterns and adjusts the room inventory accordingly. And, although I have
my peculiarities, they pretty much limited themselves in Hong Kong to
unusually high banana consumption. Imagine, if you will, how this hotel's
customer service system adjusts to a much wider range of guests'
preferences and idiosyncracies. Impressive, and not a little scary.
</p><p>
Be's first distribution channel is direct sales of our products through
the web and other methods involving direct contact between the customer
and Be. When you order a BeBox, send in a check, ask for the shipping
date, deal with warranty issues, or have general product and logistical
questions, you're working with Customer Service. Right now, that usually
means working with Lilia Simbe, who's built a reputation with our
customers for quick, pleasant, useful responses. We're building our
customer service function to enable us to deal personally and efficiently
with our growing customer base while not losing that personal contact
between the customer and someone who knows Be and its products and cares
that customers are satisfied. Early next year, when we ship our BeOS for
PowerMac product, we expect (and hope!) that our unit volume grows by two
orders of magnitude, and we very much want to keep direct contact with as
many customers as possible. That's why we'll continue to focus on direct
sales while simultaneously building other channels for our products.
</p><p>
Direct customer contact is not, by the way, a way to make more margin on
products. Life being what it is, and the "no free lunch" law continuing
to apply, all channels tend towards generating the same bottom-line
profit for a company. The main purpose of direct customer contact is to
see, hear, and feel what customers think about Be and our products.
</p><p>
So if you get in touch with Be next year to order the BeOS for PowerMac
and someone asks you if you like bananas, don't be too surprised.

The Be philosophy calls for a break from "legacy" software. But is Be
true to the call? This long-winded thread was a thoughtful (if somewhat
abstract) look at certain appropriations that, perhaps, shouldn't have
been made. The centerpiece was the concept of files: Are files
(containers of "sequential bytes of data") obsolete? Does Be pledge a
misguided allegiance to "unstylized" ASCII?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id505325"></a>Subject: Filesystem/database thoughts</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Are files really what you want?</h5></div></div></div><p>
In anticipation of the DR9 filesystem rewrite, many developers are
offering proposals of their own (and hoping out loud that Be is
listening). Too many ideas here to summarize—many of the messages
were quite detailed—but the gist of most of the offerings hinged on
whether the filesystem should be "natively" hierarchical or "databased."
</p><p>
In a related thread, a contributor posted the results of the IOZone
benchmark (which measures disk I/O speed). The results were not
glorious, but judgement is being withheld until the new filesystem
appears.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id505353"></a>Subject: Database thoughts (not filesystem related)</h4></div></div></div><p>
Some general questions about the database lead to observations and
theories of query performance as the database swells with records. The
highest number of records reported was 60,000 (with no appreciable
performance loss). Good, as far as it goes, but some folks think
billions of records (2^31) would be a reasonable and practical test.

Some thoughts on the recent announcement of chips that run at N zillion
MHz. Will they fry the user? What will the cost be after you've added

speed?

This thread was spawned from the "Why aren't two threads better..."
affair that started a couple of weeks ago. Here, we concentrated on how
multiple CPUs share the contents of the individual caches, whether one
big cache is better than many small ones (yes), and, somewhat
unrelatedly, whether a thread can (or should) pass a pointer into its
stack to another thread (not a great idea).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id505404"></a>Subject: GUI</h4></div></div></div><p>
This highly speculative thread discussed the possibility/advantage of a
3D user interface. Would it be fast enough? Would the user intuitively
understand how to fly around 3D objects? Would it just be a toy? (The
answer to this last question: Yes... but what GUI isn't?)

William Adams (the Be Evangelist) solicited specs for event data that
developers would like to "inject" into (and so be able to detect from)
the app_server. Developers responded and also debated different
approaches to various event detection techniques.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id505436"></a>Subject: Fresh Programs</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should programmers concentrate on porting existing programs, or,
instead, take the ideas of the old and rewrite them to take advantage
of Be's "fresh" software? Many folks wrote in to point out that you
have to start somewhere—porting is important if you want to get a
set of basic utilities up and running quickly. The thread then veered
into scripting.

Some words about protecting your product from piracy, the desirability
of source code escrow, and the pains of hardware-specific software.
This lead to some difference of opionion regarding the merits of free
software. Does "free" mean "not good enough to pay for?"

AKA: DSP Performance Comparison<br />
AKA: DSP on the BeBox
</h5></div></div></div><p>
The performance of PPC chips was compared to that of dedicated DSP
chips. While it was admitted (in theory) that DSPs are faster than the
PPC, it was generally agreed that programming a DSP is a pain. Also,
one contributor found that the PPC is actually faster than most (15 out
of 19) DSP chips (see http://www.bdti.com/articles/bench.html).

The thread started with a simple question about select(): Are you
limited to 32 sockets because of the 32-bit fd_set mask? (No.) This led
to a discussion of whether Be should abandon the BSD socket API in
favor of an object-oriented interface (or similar high-level layer).
Opinions were divided: Some folks find the BSD calls clunky and
limited, others think that these calls are here to stay—why accept
the overhead of a cosmetic layer?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The BSD approach was taken to make it easier to port
existing socket code. A higher-level interface is being consider (time
permitting).
