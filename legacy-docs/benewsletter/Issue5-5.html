There have been a fair number of questions recently in BeDevTalk and
BeUserTalk regarding the networking rewrite. I thought I'd use my shift
in the newsletter sweatshop to describe the new architecture and give
some details on its status.
</p><p>
This article is an attempt to roughly describe the stack internals and
give developers who might wish to create new protocols or NIC drivers
with some tasty tidbits of info. For sane, normal developers who have no
desire to work on networking internals, be assured that the sockets API
will be just as it is on your favorite BSD clone and skip down to the
$ales Pitch.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id438813"></a>Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>
BeOS networking is being completely replaced by a new architecture,
called the BeOS Networking Environment, or <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>. None of the existing
R4.x networking will survive the change; it's either being ported over to
the new architecture (in the case of drivers), or discarded completely
(in the case of the net server, net kit, netdev kit/net server add-on
architecture, PPP, Netscript, etc.) The new architecture focuses on
performance, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility, in no
specific order. It is simpler than the current net_server, yet far more
flexible.
</p><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> architecture is a modular design that allows for easy removal or
replacement of any of its individual parts, by users or by Be. In this
regard, <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> is an API spec for a networking architecture, and a
description of how those modules interoperate. The implementation Be will
ship can have parts replaced by users at will if they so desire, provided
that they adhere to the specification.

</pre><p>
As you can see from the diagram, <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> consists of a library in user space
which is linked with user programs, and a driver and several modules in
kernel space which implement the networking services. There are several
networking protocol and framing modules, as seen in the diagram, which
are structures that extend the <span class="type">module_info</span> structure to provide the
standard API used by each module type. Put another way, each module in
the above diagram is a concrete instance of an abstract C class
representing each networking module type.
</p><p>
Let's look at each driver and module type in the architecture.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
libsocket/Net API driver/kernel sockets module
</p><p>
All networking functionality visible to user programs is provided by
libsocket, which is a very thin library that opens a driver (which
provides the socket "file descriptor") and communicates with it via
<code class="function">ioctl</code>s to provide the networking API. The net API driver instantiates the
internal data structures associated with a socket (the <span class="type">bone_endpoint_t</span>),
sets up the protocol stack for each socket, and handles all communication
between the socket and the stack.
</p><p>
Other networking APIs besides BSD sockets interface could be implemented
to talk to the net API driver using the same <code class="function">ioctl</code>s
that <code class="filename">libsocket</code> does.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> also provides a libnet emulation library which allows programs
linked against the R4.x <code class="filename">libnet.so</code> to continue to function, ensuring
binary compatibility.
</p><p>
And finally, for the truly ambitious amongst you who are developing
networked file systems and such, you'll be happy to hear that there is a
kernel module interface to the sockets API so you'll be able to use
networking from kernel land.
</p></li><li><p>
<acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> utilities module
</p><p>
The <code class="filename">bone_util</code> module contains functionality that the other modules need
and/or that doesn't fit elsewhere. <code class="filename">bone_data</code> (see below) manipulation,
benaphores, fifos, masked data copying, and other "generic" utilities are
provided here. All parts of the <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> system use this important module. It
defines operations for several data types.
</p><p>
A <span class="type">bone_data_t</span> is a data type that is used in <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> as a container for
transient networking data. While it fulfills the same requirements as
<span class="type">mbuf</span>s do under a BSD networking architecture, <span class="type">bone_data_t</span> are quite
different than <span class="type">mbuf</span>s and suffer from none of <span class="type">mbuf</span>s' limitations or
problems.
</p><p>
Central to the efficiency of a networking stack is reducing the amount of
data copies. Unlike <span class="type">mbuf</span>s, <span class="type">bone_data_t</span> are containers of lists of iovecs.
A <span class="type">bone_data_t</span> contains two such lists: a "freelist," which contains
pointers to actual memory addresses that need to be freed, and a
"datalist," which contains a virtual "view" of networking memory that can
not only be very efficiently accessed, but also easily modified.
</p><p>
Consider the following scenario. A user calls "sendto" with a buffer
containing a udp datagram that is 2000 bytes long. This results in a
<span class="type">bone_data_t</span> with the following layout:
</p><div class="programlistingco"><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">bone_data_t</span> {
    <code class="varname">datalist</code>: {<code class="varname">iov_base</code> = &amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="varname">iov_len</code> = 2000}
    <code class="varname">freelist</code>: {&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 2000}<a id="bone_data.freelist"></a><span class="callout"><img src="images/callouts/1.png" alt="1" /></span>
}
</pre><div class="calloutlist"><table summary="Callout list"><tr><td><a href="#bone_data.freelist"><span class="callout"><img src="images/callouts/1.png" alt="1" /></span></a> </td><td>
actually this wouldn't be here in this case since on datagram sends
<acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> is zero-copy and would pass the user's buffer directly to the NIC
driver rather than allocating a new buffer that would later need freeing.
But we'll leave it here for demonstration purposes.)
</td></tr></table></div></div><p>
The udp layer would then add a header to the data. This is easily done by
simply adding an <span class="type">iovec</span> to the chain:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">bone_data_t</span> {
    <code class="varname">datalist</code>: {&amp;<code class="varname">udp_header</code>, 8}, {&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 2000}
    <code class="varname">freelist</code>: {&amp;<code class="varname">udp_header</code>, 8}, {&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 2000}
}
</pre><p>
(Again, the <span class="type">udp_header</span> would not *really* be added to the free list,
since the udp layer would be using a local buffer for it that would not
need freeing, but we'll use it as an example, as with the IP header
below.)
</p><p>
Now, suppose the interface it's being sent on has an MTU of 1500 bytes.
IP would need to fragment the data and add an IP header to each frag.
</p><p>
On other systems (especially BSD-based systems that use mbufs), multiple
copies would need to be done here. <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> simply manipulates iovecs in
their lists:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">bone_data_t</span> {
    <code class="varname">datalist</code>: {&amp;<code class="varname">ip_header</code>, 20},{&amp;<code class="varname">udp_header</code>, 8}, {&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>,
   1472}, {&amp;<code class="varname">ip_header_2</code>, 20},
{&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code> + 1472, 528}
    <code class="varname">freelist</code>: {&amp;<code class="varname">ip_header_2</code>, 20},{&amp;<code class="varname">ip_header</code>,
20},{&amp;<code class="varname">udp_header</code>, 8}, {&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 2000}
}
</pre><p>
By manipulating the logical view of the data rather than copying, bone
will see a big scalability and performance win when using large datagrams
(such as during bulk data transfer of things like large image files).
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="type">bone_proto_info_t</span>
</p><p>
All the protocols are implemented as instances of <span class="type">bone_proto_info_t</span>.
These are chained together as appropriate in structures called
<span class="type">bone_proto_node_t</span> for each networking endpoint instance when it is
created. A <code class="filename">driver_settings</code> configuration file specifies which protocols
to put in a socket's stack when the socket is created.
</p><p>
(If you're afraid of looking at a config file for efficiency reasons,
don't be; the bone_util module contains optimized functions for reading
the <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> settings. On average, opening a socket under <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> takes on the
order of 300 usec (microseconds)).
</p><p>
When networking operations occur, the net api driver calls the
appropriate function in the <span class="type">bone_proto_info_t</span> module on top of its
protocol stack. The protocol then performs all necessary
protocol-specific operations and calls the next protocol in the chain, on
down to the network layer protocol, which passes the final data on to the
datalink layer.
</p><p>
To add a new protocol to bone, one essentially creates a <span class="type">bone_proto_info_t</span>
"subclass" for the protocol, and adds entries for it to the <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>
configuration file. It will be loaded at runtime by either the API driver
(for new sockets) or the datalink layer (for inbound data).
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="filename">bone_datalink</code>
</p><p>
The datalink module is the center of the <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> architecture.
</p><p>
The datalink module handles things like routing,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Address Resolution Protocol">ARP</acronym>, interface
management and link-level framing. The first thing the datalink module
does is load the network interface driver modules. Each of them then
scans hardware and does its hoodoo magic, and calls back into the
datalink module to register an <span class="type">ifnet_t</span> structure for each instance of the
networking card that they find. The modules reregister at any time they
need to, responding to things like new cardbus cards being inserted, new
USB interfaces being logically added, etc.
</p><p>
Each time an interface is brought up (via <span class="application">ifconfig</span>, etc.), the datalink
module spawns off a thread which blocks on the interface module's receive
method. When new data arrives on the interface, it's read by that thread,
demuxed, and pushed up the appropriate protocol stack to the receive
queue of the appropriate <span class="type">bone_endpoint_t</span>.
</p><p>
The fact that each interface has its own reader thread associated with
it, in addition to the fact that multiple user-level threads will be
pushing data simultaneously through the system, should provide <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> with
greater scalability than other systems, particularly in the area of stack
latency. Multiple-interface BeOS systems perform quite well under <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>.
</p><p>
Networking Interfaces are represented using the traditional BSD struct
ifnet data structure, modified for BeOS. This structure contains much
info about an interface, including the various addresses associated with
it, volatile statistics, the <span class="type">bone_interface_info_t</span> module to use for the
interface, and the <span class="type">bone_frame_info_t</span> module to use for framing the data.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="type">bone_frame_info_t</span>
</p><p>
Since many different interfaces use the same link-level framing types,
these were isolated out into modules to facilitate reuse. For example,
any number of ethernet card driver modules can load the single bone_802.3
module for their framing needs.
</p><p>
Similarly, by decoupling framing from the rest of the link layer, a
single NIC driver module can use different types of framing. For example,
a HiPPI interface that is configured to use the HiPPI physical layer vs.
its logical layer framing. Another example would be an ethernet interface
that wants to send jumbograms rather than 1500-byte ethernet frames.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="type">bone_interface_info_t</span>
</p><p>
A networking-oriented interface to device drivers is added in <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>, to be
used in writing NIC drivers. If desired, a traditional device driver can
also export a <span class="type">bone_interface_info_t</span> module interface, which makes porting
existing drivers easy.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id433343"></a>Sample Code</h3></div></div></div><p>
In the way of sample code, I have included the current snapshot of
<code class="filename">bone_proto.h</code> and
<code class="filename">bone_interface.h</code>, the two headers most useful to the
majority of you who will be writing <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> modules. I have also included a
snapshot of the <code class="filename">bone_util.h</code> <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> utilities header file, since the other
files use it so much. Finally, I've included the source code to the <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>
loopback interface module to illustrate how to write a network interface
module. To get the code: &lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/bone/bone.zip&gt;.
</p><p>
Note that these files should be considered alpha-level software. They are
likely to change in the future. The loopback module is (purposely)
nonoptimized and provided as an illustration; real loopback operations
are heavily optimized in <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> and bypass this module entirely.
</p><p>
While these files aren't everything you need to start developing for
<acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym>, they should give you an idea of the directions you should be
heading in.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id433412"></a>Massively Cool Features (the $ales Pitch)</h3></div></div></div><p>
In addition to the traditional BeOS GUI-based tools, all of your favorite
UNIX networking utilities are either already ported or will port readily.
Examples include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
BIND 8.2 tools: addr, dnsquery, irpd, named-bootconf, nslookup, dig,
host, mkservdb, named-xfer, nsupdate, dnskeygen, named, ndc
</p></li><li><p>
Configuration Tools: route, ifconfig, etc.
</p></li><li><p>
Utilities: telnet, ping, ftp, traceroute, tcpdump, libpcap, etc.
</p></li><li><p>
and many more.
</p></li></ul><p>
Almost every feature that BeOS net developers have been asking for is
there; sockets are file descriptors, the sockets API is much more
compliant, raw sockets are there, it's relatively easy to add new
protocols, there is a kernel networking interface, and so on.
</p><p>
Net performance has improved massively; there are no hard numbers (and we
haven't finished optimizing) but our benchmarks are putting <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> around
twenty times (2000%) the speed of the current net_server; <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> is in the
same league as Linux and FreeBSD, though not fully competitive with their
speed yet. Yet. :-)
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id450451"></a>Schedule</h3></div></div></div><p>
OK, I realize that the biggest question all of you are asking is "when?" In
traditional Be style, I can only say "soon." The new stack is almost ready
for beta. And that's all I can say for now.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevWorkshop5-5"></a>Developers' Workshop: Optimize Anytime with cputime</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Marco</span> <span class="surname">Nelissen</span></span></div></div></div><p>
As one of the new guys at Be, I've been able to avoid the task of writing
a newsletter article for a while. Today though, my fellow DTS engineers
finally located my secret hideout, and promptly assigned me the task of
writing this week's Engineering Insights article. So, as we say in the
Netherlands: "here it is."
</p><p>
In this article I'll present a small application, written a long time ago
when I wanted to measure cpu usage of the <span class="application">SoundPlay</span> mp3 player (you may
have heard of it). Specifically, I wanted to compare its cpu usage with
that of the other players available at the time: I wanted to see which
threads used the most cpu and when they used it. The resulting app is
(not surprisingly) called <span class="application">cputime</span>. You can download the source code at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/kernel_kit/cputime.zip&gt;.
</p><p>
You can start from the command line this way:
</p><pre class="screen">
cputime application arguments
</pre><p>
where "application" is the application you want to measure and
"arguments" are the arguments (if any) you want to pass to the
application. <span class="application">cputime</span> will launch the specified application with the given
arguments. While the application is running, <span class="application">cputime</span> will continuously
monitor its cpu usage, either until the application exits or <span class="application">cputime</span>'s
sampling buffer is full. When either of these happens, <span class="application">cputime</span> will open
a window and graphically display the cpu-usage over time of each thread
of the application.
</p><p>
Because of the way <span class="application">cputime</span> works, threads that are created and destroyed
within one sampling interval are "lost" and don't show up in the display.
If the application you want to monitor rapidly spawns new threads that
run for only a very short time and then die, you may want to modify

Not surprisingly, last week's column brought more questions and one or
two arguments to my BeMail mailbox. I appreciate these responses—they
help me understand where we need to make ourselves "even" clearer. More
than one reader noted that I've become more cautious, shall we say, a
little less "colorful" in my observations. It's not clear whether this is
seen as regrettable or, au contraire, a welcome change.
</p><p>
And, yes, my column is vetted by our legal counsel for statements that
would in fact or appearance cause trouble with the powers that oversee
the stock market. It's one thing to believe in emerging opportunities,
but one's optimism can to easily be interpreted as promoting not the
product, but the company's securities (notwithstanding the potential
entendre-doubling the latter noun might suggest). The fact that our
company's stock is publicly traded impacts what I can and cannot say.
</p><p>
Second, several readers proclaimed they don't care for Internet
Appliances, don't need them, and feel we're misguided for getting into
them. This suggests that we haven't made a good enough case yet for this
emerging genre of connected devices—for their benefits in general and
for the role our technology can play in this emerging area. Readers
object that "my PC does everything I need, so I have no use for any of
these Internet devices." But this is not a PC versus IA (Internet
Appliance) debate. It's PC and IA, not PC versus IA.
</p><p>
In theory, a PC is capable of infinite mutability through software and
hardware add-ons that can simulate any experience. I'm exaggerating, of
course, but the idea that the PC is a simulation engine is fundamentally
correct. So is the idea that dedicated, specialized devices always appear
in a prosperous ecological niche and coexist with the general purpose
ones.
</p><p>
Let's put Swiss Army knives and screwdrivers aside and look at
automobiles. The last 20 years have brought us specialized vehicles such
as minivans and SUVs. The same kind of specialization is appearing in the
digital realm, with telephones, Palm VIIs, TVs, stereos, alarm systems,
WebPads, Tivo video recorders, pagers, Web Minitels, and similar
information appliances and, yes, PCs. And for everything that we can see
or imagine now, there are many other kinds of devices our inevitably
derivative thinking prevents us from intuiting in the present moment.
</p><p>
As for myself, whether or not I can make good guesses as to which
Internet Appliances will survive beyond the concept stage, I know we're
onto something. Go buy a Tivo hard disk video recorder. Today, it
connects to the Net through a slow telephone line. Watch your children
use it and quickly forget that there was a time when Tivo didn't exist.
Now let's muster our available derivative thinking and "picture" what
will happen when the Net connection is always open, say via cable modem
or DSL. We'll be able to program the recorder from anywhere in the house,
or in the world, through a browser, with no need to download the TV
schedule at night as the Tivo box does today.
</p><p>
No, it's not video on demand—that will come later with a beefier Net
infrastructure. And no, we don't really need these appliances. Nor do we
really need PCs, or cars, or chocolate. Personally, I'd rather give up
PCs than books. But just as we don't seem to want to live without
personal transportation, there's a good chance that we'll find these
appliances exciting or liberating enough to want them, regardless of what
we call need.
</p><p>
Next week, I'll describe how one of us uses PCs, appliances, and wireless
technology for home entertainment.
