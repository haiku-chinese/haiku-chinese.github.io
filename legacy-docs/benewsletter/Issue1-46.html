A lot of Be developers have expressed interest in writing drivers for all
sorts of network media, such as ATM, 100VG, 100Base-T, alternative ISA
and PCI Ethernet cards, PLIP, and SLIP. In fact, I've had more requests
about doing network media drivers for the BeOS than doing anything else
that's network-related, whether it be alternative protocol stacks, TCP
enhancements, or application issues. It isn't what I expected, but then
again, things never are.
</p><p>
In response to the great developer interest in doing network drivers,
I'll do two things:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
First, I'll increase the priority of developing a netcard driver
architecture for BeOS, aiming for release in DR9.
</p></li><li><p>
Second, I'll start an "early adopter" program where you can get
started with DR8. To enroll in the program, all you need to do is read
this article and download some stuff from the Be FTP site. I won't ask
you for money, date of birth, spending habits, or how often you pick
your nose.
</p></li></ul><p>
Now, for some caveats and limitations:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The DR8 version of the driver architecture will only support Ethernet
drivers or things that look like Ethernet. In other words, your driver
had better be prepared to read and write 1514-byte packets, including
the 14-byte Ethernet header. The header contains the 48-bit destination
address, followed by the 48-bit source address, followed by the 16- bit
protocol field.
</p></li><li><p>
A lot of things will change when the API is officially released, so
please don't start flaming me when your code doesn't recompile or your
binary stops working.
</p></li><li><p>
The interface presented here is somewhat messy. Its purpose is to get
you started getting real work done, not to be framed, placed lovingly
upon a wall, and admired for hours on end.
</p></li></ul><p>
OK, now that we have that out of the way, let's get down to business.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id503058"></a>The DR8 Version</h3></div></div></div><p>
For the DR8 version, an Ethernet driver consists of two binaries. The
first is the low-level device driver for the card you're interested in.
The second is a high-level add- on, which is used to configure the card.
For example, let's say your card is the fictional "Ackme" card. Your
device driver would be stored in "/system/drivers/ackme", and your add-on
would be in "/system/add-ons/net_server/ackme".
</p><p>
The device driver needs the following standard device driver entry
points: <code class="function">open()</code>, <code class="function">control()</code>,
<code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, and <code class="function">close()</code>.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="function">open()</code>, in most cases, should always return
<code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>. The actual
opening of the card is performed by...
</p></li><li><p>
...the <code class="function">control()</code> call. There are two messages for the control call:
<code class="constant">ETHER_INIT</code> and <code class="constant">ETHER_GETADDR</code>.
<code class="constant">ETHER_INIT</code> takes card-specific parameters
—such as IRQ values or I/O port numbers—and attempts to open the
card. <code class="constant">ETHER_GETADDR</code> returns the 48-bit Ethernet address associated with
the card.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">read()</code> blocks until a packet is received, and then fills in the input
buffer with the packet contents (including header) and returns the size.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">write()</code> does the opposite of <code class="function">read()</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">close()</code> does pretty much what you would expect.
</p></li></ul><p>
The add-on contains three entry points: <code class="function">configure()</code>, <code class="function">driver_open()</code>, and
<code class="function">get_pretty_name()</code>.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="function">configure()</code> is the main guts of the add-on. It's called by the
Network preferences application, and its job is to put up a window to
ask users how they want the card configured.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">driver_open()</code> is called by the net server to open the driver. It
returns a file descriptor that the net server will invoke <code class="function">ioctl()</code>,
<code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, and <code class="function">close()</code> on.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">get_pretty_name()</code> is called by the Network preference application to
print a more mnemonic name for the driver, such as "3Com Etherlink II"
rather than "3c503".
</p></li></ul><p>
There are a lot of details that I've left out here, but the source code
from the FTP site should be pretty self- explanatory.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id503249"></a>The Future</h3></div></div></div><p>
The API for the "real" architecture will be a lot cleaner than this. Most
likely, it will be an object-oriented add-on that the net server and
Network preferences application can both use. The add-on, in turn, may
invoke its own device driver, but that's an implementation detail that
only the add-on will need to know about. Therefore, some network drivers
can be written completely as user programs. However, anything that wants
to catch interrupts must have a device driver component.
</p><p>
Stay tuned for further details. In the meantime, check out

The BeOS is full of lots of nifty things that make programming a breeze.
We'd like you to think that the API presented by the system is much
easier to use than a lot of legacy systems. Well, this is true to a
point. And that point is what distinguishes Be, Inc. from everyone else.
Even if the API isn't easier in some areas, we will make sure that it is
at least well understood so that useful work can be done as painlessly as
possible.
</p><p>
On BeDevTalk and comp.sys.be there has been much discussion about issues
at as low a level as the effects of cache line contention on
multithreaded applications, and as relevant as optimal graphics blits
using the vertical blanking area of a graphics card.
</p><p>
Well, I've also received requests for some very basic information on how
to get started using the BeOS. This week I'd like to address this very
basic need.
</p><p>
"The Be Book" is very good at explaining the API of the system as it
exists. There are now currently a number of sample programs that
developers can look at to get started. But there doesn't necessarily
exist a straightforward tutorial on how simple things should actually get
done.
</p><p>
So... You will find such a tutorial in:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/January.tgz
</p><p>
It's about time! Well, actually it's not, it's just a simple calendar
program.
</p><p>
In this tutorial you will find things such as:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
How do I create a basic GUI based application?
</li><li>
How do I draw to the screen?
</li><li>
How can I display text quickly?
</li><li>
How do I deal with messages?
</li><li>
How do I close down the application cleanly?
</li></ul><p>
The sample application is a simple calendar display of the month of
January. The application itself isn't too fancy, as we don't want its
functions to get in the way of a clear understanding of what's going on.
But there's enough interesting stuff to make it less trivial than the
HelloWorld application.
</p><p>
Most of the information in the tutorial can ultimately be found in "The
Be Book," but this tutorial puts it together in a succinct way so that
you don't have to go read the whole book to figure things out.
</p><p>
I have a particular agenda for what things will be introduced in
tutorials in the near future, and in what order. If you have any
requests, please feel free to e-mail me and tell me what you want
(wadams@be.com).

Here are some recent ftp.be.com uploads that you might find interesting
and want to employ.

Title: BeInfo<br />
Location: ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/util/BeInfo.tgz<br />
Author: Frederic Tessier (tessier@moebius.qc.ca)
</p><p>
This is a nice system info display that shows you things like memory
used, pages, semaphores, ports, threads, teams. It also shows machine ID,
type of CPU, clock rate, and PCI bus clock rate. The display of resource
information is updated periodically.
</p><p>
Title: New games including BeTetris, XOIDS<br />

</p><p>
Need I say more? Everybody needs a way to burn all those extra cycles on
their machines. Here are a few games that will help you do this with ease.
</p><p>
Title: DataTypes<br />
Location: ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/libraries/Datatypes13.tar.gz<br />
Author: Jon Watte (hplus@ix.netcom.com)
</p><p>
This is one of the most powerful concepts that exists on the BeOS. The
problem is simple: How can you translate between file types without
having to write a whole bunch of code? This library provides a framework
that should be used by all developers interested in integrating foreign
data.
</p><p>
Jon Watte, who happens to work for Metrowerks, has developed and provided
this library on his own time to make the BeOS incrementally better than
what's available on other platforms. You can't go wrong using this free
software, or at least learning from it and trying to implement your own
framework (please don't do this).
</p><p>
Jon is very receptive to suggestions as to how this library can be
improved and has been trying to get it adopted for the longest time.
There is probably no better endorsement than from the horse's mouth, so I
say, "Go use this thing." It will be used in future tutorials as a matter
of course. Get used to it, feel comfortable with it, make suggestions as
to how it can become better.

We are presently in the process of compiling a demo CD, which will be
used by the Be demo team to show off the BeOS around the world. We have
asked that developers wanting their software to show up on this CD make
it available real soon. The first CD will be pressed within a week (by
October 28). Don't panic if you can't make it for this one. There will be
more in the future, because we always want to put our best foot forward.
</p><p>
If you have any ideas or votes for your favorite demos, please feel free
to drop me e-mail and voice your opinion. You probably know as well, if
not better than we, what really excites people about the BeOS.

I'm not a professional programmer. I'm a chemist working on organic and
inorganic hybrid materials for a Japanese automobile company. Currently,
I'm studying the reaction of silane compounds and the product consequent
to such reactions.
</p><p>
In my laboratory I use a number of different scientific instruments,
which output data in various formats: MS-DOS text from the X-ray diffract
meter, CP-M unknown files from the Infrared spectrometer, USCD P-sytem(!)
files from TG/DTA. Most modern instruments are computer-controlled, but
some of the older instruments—the pH meter, thermometer, and so on --
give me only DC voltage, and I have to store the data on an analog chart
recorder.
</p><p>
Old or new, almost all my instruments have either a serial port or an
analog voltage output. To manage all my instruments in a uniform way, I
need a PC that accepts both analog data and digital data. This PC is
called the BeBox. It has a nice "GeekPort" and many serial ports
(including the MIDI ports—it can convert physical properties to
musical data!). I want the BeBox to be the interpreter between my
instruments, and to control the machines that don't naturally understand
digital signals.
</p><p>
I have just received DR8 and am studying the GeekPort. My plans are only
just forming, but here's what I'm thinking: One of my ideas as a chemist
is to make an easy-to-use, data-collection/analysis/synthesis-control
program. As a geek who likes music, I'd also like to make a MIDI-to-CV
converter application that can play the antique music synthesizers I have
(the one that don't understand MIDI signals).
</p><p>
Of course, the BeOS isn't perfect; I wish it could handle the 2-byte
character codes we use to represent the Japanese language. I've heard
that the BeOS will support Unicode in the near future. This is a start --
but in Japan, we use JIS code on the internet, and S-JIS code on PCs and
Macs. If the BeOS is going to compete with PCs and Macintosh in the
Japanese market, I think it must at least support S-JIS Kanji code.

Last time I started to describe our channel strategy and promised future
articles to elaborate on it. I haven't forgotten this promise, but, this
time, I wanted to take a side trip into a topic that's always on our
minds at Be: recruiting.
</p><p>
Startup companies tend to have two distinct recruiting modes: "Pain
relief" and "go for it." You may not be familiar with these terms (I just
made them up), so let me explain.
</p><p>
The "pain relief" mode of recruiting involves hiring people into the
organization when the workload on people already in the company has
attained maximum tolerable pain level. For example, if you find yourself
waking up in the morning with your face down on your keyboard, you've
probably reached this level. I should hasten to add that this is a rare
occurrence at Be and, when it does happen, has occasionally resulted in
the production of useful code, C++ being a sufficiently flexible language
that random nocturnal movements of one's face on the keyboard during REM
sleep can generate compilable code. "Pain relief" recruiting is partly a
way of conserving cash during a company's formative years, mostly a
consequence of the fact that, when you're busy, it takes longer than it
should to hire new people.
</p><p>
The "go for it" mode of recruiting involves eyeballing a one, two, or
three-year business plan, deciding that the company is destined for
continued, solid growth, and hiring ahead of the curve to ensure that the
growth is actually supportable.
</p><p>
You're probably ahead of me at this point: Be is about to enter a phase
of "go for it" recruiting in the sales, support, and marketing areas.
Next month, we'll be shipping Developer Release 8 of the BeOS for
PowerMac, and "MacTech" magazine will be bundling a free copy in its
January issue (which will also ship next month, because magazine
publishers have a different calendar from the rest of us). Early next
year, we'll be shipping a release of the BeOS for PowerMac targeted at a
wider audience, not just at developers. This translates into big volumes,
which in turn translates into the need for excellent order fulfillment,
customer support, and technical support organizations.
</p><p>
Our web site will carry detailed job descriptions of positions as they
come open; check out http://www.be.com/aboutbe/jobs/index.html if you're
interested. During the next two months, we'll be building the support
organizations designed to carry us through what promises to be a very
interesting 1997.

The one-two punch of good news from Apple deserves more than a
perfunctory cheer, it signals a new competitive stance and raises
interesting questions for the Mac clone makers, including Motorola (who
makes the PowerPC chips and is to supply Mac motherboards to cloners).
Apple's numbers surprised most analysts. They expected a loss in the
$30-60 million range. Instead, Apple posted a $25 million net profit.
Perhaps more important, Apple's cash flow from operations amounted to
$410 million. The next day, the company made headlines again by
announcing some of the models Apple's COO had energetically previewed the
week before—with surprisingly low prices. The new Performa 6400 models
are priced several hundred dollars lower than Wintel clones with
comparable processor speeds. The announcement was so sudden it must have
caught some resellers off guard. This Sunday's "New York Times" offers an
IQ test in the same J&amp;R ad: would you rather buy a 120MHz 7200 with 16 MB
RAM, a 1.2 GB drive, and a 4X CD-ROM, or a new 200 MHz 6200 with 16 MB
RAM, a 2.4 GB drive, 8X CD-ROM, and 28.8 Kbps modem, microphone, and
speakers thrown in? We can expect a little scrambling here and there. The
rumor is Marco Landi won the decision for these aggressive prices at the
last minute. Planned or not, this is exquisite timing, right at the edge
of the Christmas buying season. First, announce financial results showing
Apple coming out of a tailspin. This tells potential buyers they can
trust Apple to be around for a while. Second, blow away the old Wintel
selling point—price. This should make for an interesting quarter.
Writing Apple's obituary isn't new: When I first started at Apple,
naysayers were already predicting Apple's impending demise by reason of
lacking CP/M and 8-inch floppies—and the company's imminent
destruction by Fortune Systems homing in on Apple with 68000-based Wang
emulation. Not then, not now. And marketing being just as much about
minds as things, there's reason to hope Apple is beginning to reverse its
downward momentum.
</p><p>
A few interesting questions remain, though. FY 96 revenues fell about 11
percent below the FY 95 $11 billion level, and this past quarter sales
fell 23 percent under last years comparable level, this at time when the
PC industry continues to experience double-digit growth rates. This could
explain the aggressive pricing for the new models. Notwithstanding the
dangerously naive "Win 95 = Mac 89" bumper stickers, the Macintosh had
lost its technical edge over the Wintel machines and it was more
expensive. This is no longer the case. It will be interesting to watch if
and how new entrants, such as Sony and Toshiba, react and reprice their
new 200 MHz machines and how the established home Wintel machines get
repositioned against an aggressive 160 Mhz Performa at $1,499.
</p><p>
This, in turn, raises another question: What about the PowerMac clone
makers? A few days before the latest announcement, a new Mac compatible
maker appeared on the scene, APS, well-known in the Mac market for their
storage devices and accessories. ("Maker" is probably a misnomer, as
Motorola will make the motherboard and chassis for APS's clone.) The
prices posted on their web site are not materially different from
comparable Apple machines. Apple even appears to enjoy an advantage in
bundling a modem and an interesting collection of software. Apple execs
have been heard grumbling that clone makers were "cherry picking," that
is, going for the juiciest higher-end segments of the Mac market instead
of obediently focusing on the low end, where Apple couldn't make money.
Things will get interesting and will test Apple's genuine will to create
a vibrant hardware market based on the Macintosh platform. The
conversations among Apple, Motorola, and clone makers are likely to be
animated. Who gets the best price for processors, and by how much? Apple,
the Motorola division making Mac motherboards, or Power Computing if they
buy CPU chips from IBM? Besides the cost of the microprocessor, who
manufactures the lowest cost motherboard: Apple, Motorola, Power
Computing? We'll be watching to see whether the Mac clone market becomes
