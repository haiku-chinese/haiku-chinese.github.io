“<span class="quote">The needs of digital content design, not to mention physics and
economics, are coming into conflict with current OS architectures. A new
definition, the Media OS, can unlock the door to more powerful
media-based personal systems, and extract more performance from the
systems we are using today.</span>”
</p><p>
This is the summary of a very interesting technical white paper, The
Media OS, http://www.be.com/products/beos/mediaos.html, which points out
a harsh reality of today's computer systems: Even though the hardware
necessary to create a blazingly fast media workstation is available now
(and at affordable prices), legacy operating systems won't let go of the
leash. Unshackling the hardware is exactly what we have been trying to
address in designing the BeOS to smoothly handle multiple heavy duty
tasks at the same time.
</p><p>
Be's commitment to the media world has been strongly strengthened in the
last few months, thanks to the work of our new media team. On the graphic
server side, adding support for 15 and 16 bits per pixel color depth was
the first step toward integrating the new media framework. The creation
of <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>, the topic of today's lecture, is a second step.
</p><p>
Let's imagine you have a fast and cheap piece of video acquisition
hardware—say, the Bt848 based card ($90.00)—and a fast,
moderately-priced Matrox AGP graphics accelerator ($200-250). You want
the AGP to display a video stream sent in realtime by the Bt848. How are
you going to do that? On a legacy OS, the standard answer is to DMA every
frame to an off-screen buffer in main memory and then shuffle each buffer
to the screen using the graphics system. In no time you've earned
yourself a hefty overhead and some synchronization problems.
</p><p>
So the geek in the corner raises his hand and asks: "Why not DMA directly
into the frame buffer?"
</p><p>
Good question.
</p><p>
It's possible—but you'll have to switch to exclusive full screen mode.
No more windows, and, in many cases, no more graphic system support (who
needs that ;-). What you gain in improved bandwidth, you lose in
extensibility, scaleability, and general usefulness.
</p><p>
Then our friend speaks again: "So why not access the frame buffer
directly, but stay synchronized with the windowing system at the same
time?"
</p><p>
And the rest of the class laughs.
</p><p>
Back in the real world, there are a few architectures that attempt to
juggle direct buffer access with a general windowing system, but they're
usually limited to "temporary exclusive access." This means you can lock
the entire screen, query the state of a window, do whatever direct access
you need, and then unlock the screen.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, these implementations perform poorly, they're very heavy
to use, and they don't respect any reasonable scheduling expectations
(it's impossible to avoid dropping frames if you do anything else at the
same time). Clearly not what you would expect from a multimedia
workstation.
</p><p>
Now it's time to look at <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>.
</p><p>
Simply put, <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> gives you exactly what we've been describing --
except it should really work. <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>
is derived from <code class="classname">BWindow</code> and,
unlike its bastard cousin <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>, it quacks
just like a <code class="classname">BWindow</code>.
Every function implemented by <code class="classname">BWindow</code> is
supported by <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>; even
the constructors use the same parameters. <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> is so similar to
BWindow that you can replace all your <code class="classname">BWindow</code> objects with
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>s, and your app would look and perform exactly as it did
before.
</p><p>
In addition to supporting the <code class="classname">BWindow</code>
API, <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> defines five new
functions, the most interesting of which is the hook function
<code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
virtual <span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">DirectConnected</code>(<span class="type">direct_buffer_info *</span><code class="parameter">info</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> communicates directly with the window manager in the
app server. It gives you a full description of the region of the graphics
frame buffer that you're allowed to access directly (i.e. the visible
part of the content area of your window) and is called whenever the state
of the region changes, such as when your window is obscured by some other
window. You job is to do whatever you need to do to and then get out --
the window manager is waiting for you!
</p><p>
(Typically, "what you need to do" means changing the graphic context
that's used by the thread that you created to control the animation or
streaming—or whatever you're doing.)
</p><p>
The argument to <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> is a
pointer to a <span class="type">direct_buffer_info</span>
struct:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
typedef struct {
  <span class="type">direct_buffer_state</span>    <code class="varname">buffer_state</code>;
  <span class="type">direct_driver_state</span>    <code class="varname">driver_state</code>;
  <span class="type">void          *</span><code class="varname">bits</code>;
  <span class="type">void          *</span><code class="varname">pci_bits</code>;
  <span class="type">int32</span>          <code class="varname">bytes_per_row</code>;
  <span class="type">uint32</span>         <code class="varname">bits_per_pixel</code>;
  <span class="type">color_space</span>    <code class="varname">pixel_format</code>;
  ...            ...
  <span class="type">uint32</span>         <code class="varname">clip_list_count</code>;
  <span class="type">clipping_rect</span>  <code class="varname">window_bounds</code>;
  <span class="type">clipping_rect</span>  <code class="varname">clip_bounds</code>;
  <span class="type">clipping_rect</span>  <code class="varname">clip_list</code>[1];
} <span class="type">direct_buffer_info</span>;
</pre><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="varname">buffer_state</code>, when masked with
<code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODE_MASK</code>, tells you the state
of frame buffer access:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
switch (<code class="varname">info</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">buffer_state</code> &amp; <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODE_MASK</code>) {
  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_START</code> : <span class="comment">/* Access is initiated. */</span>
    ...
  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_STOP</code> : <span class="comment">/* Access has ended. */</span>
    ...
  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODIFY</code> : <span class="comment">/* The buffer has changed. */</span>
    ...
}
</pre><p>
You always get a <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_START</code> when the window is opened, followed by
any number of <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODIFY</code> states, and
then a <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_STOP</code> when the
window is dragged or closed, or if the screen resolution changes. (A
"window dragged" or "resolution changed" stop command would be followed
immediately by another start.)
</p><p>
Other buffer_state masks tell you if the visible portion of the buffer
has changed (<code class="constant">B_CLIPPING_MODIFIED</code>), if the window has been resized
(<code class="constant">B_BUFFER_RESIZED</code>) or has moved
(<code class="constant">B_BUFFER_MOVED</code>), or if the frame buffer
has been reset (<code class="constant">B_BUFFER_RESET</code>).
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">driver_state</code> indicates the state of the
graphics card. <code class="constant">B_MODE_CHANGED</code>
means that the resolution/depth of the screen changed since the last
DirectConnected was called. <code class="constant">B_DRIVER_CHANGED</code> means that your window was
moved onto another monitor.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">bits</code> is a pointer to the frame buffer data (in your app's memory space).
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">pci_bits</code> is the address of the frame buffer in the pci memory space.
You need this if you're doing <acronym class="acronym">DMA</acronym>.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">bytes_per_row</code>, <code class="varname">bits_per_pixel</code>, and
<code class="varname">pixel_format</code> describe the size and
format of the frame buffer pixel data.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">window_bounds</code> and <code class="varname">clip_bounds</code>
are bounds rectangles that enclose the
entire window and the visible portion of the window.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">clip_list_count</code> and <code class="varname">clip_list</code>
are the number of rectangles that make up
the visible portions of the window, and the rectangles themselves.
RESPECTING THE CLIPPING AREA IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. It won't be
enforced for you by the system (it can't, as you get direct access to the
frame buffer). This means your clipping code has to be as good as the
system clipping code. This is probably the biggest drawback of
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>.
</p></li></ul><p>
The <span class="type">direct_buffer_info</span> structure itself is obsolete as soon as
<code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> exits, but the information it contains remains valid as
defined by the protocol.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id675942"></a>An Example</h3></div></div></div><p>
This brief excerpt shows a simplified <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> constructor,
destructor, and <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> implementation. The object is designed
to use DMA:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MyDirectWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">MyDirectWindow</code>(...) : <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>(...)
{
  <code class="function">open_dma_control</code>();
  <code class="varname">connected</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
  <code class="varname">connection_disabled</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
  <code class="varname">my_locker</code> = new <code class="classname">BLocker</code>();
}

<code class="classname">MyDirectWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">~MyDirectWindow</code>()
{
  <code class="varname">connection_disabled</code> = <code class="constant">true</code>;
  <code class="methodname">Hide</code>();
  <code class="methodname">Sync</code>();
  delete <code class="varname">my_locker</code>;
  <code class="function">close_dma_control</code>();
}

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyDirectWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">DirectConnected</code>(<code class="parameter">info</code>)
{
  if (!connected &amp;&amp; connection_disabled) return;
  <code class="varname">my_locker</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Lock</code>();
  switch (<code class="varname">info</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">buffer_state</code> &amp; <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODE_MASK</code>)
  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_START</code> :
    <code class="varname">connected</code> = <code class="constant">true</code>;
    <code class="function">init_direct_screen_access_context</code>();
    <code class="function">start_dma</code>();
    break;

  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_STOP</code> :
    <code class="function">stop_dma</code>();
    <code class="varname">connected</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
    break;

  case <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_MODIFY</code> :
    <code class="function">update_direct_screen_access_context</code>();
    <code class="function">modify_dma</code>();
    break;
  }
  <code class="varname">my_locker</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Unlock</code>();
}
</pre><p>
Note the <code class="methodname">Hide()</code> and <code class="methodname">Sync()</code>
calls in the destructor. This sequence, and
the "connection" flags that predicate the <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> call, ensure
that the <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> will stop direct access after the destruction has
started.
</p><p>
Many more examples using <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> should be available in the
following weeks.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676155"></a>BDirectWindow as a BWindow</h3></div></div></div><p>
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> is a dual object, with two completely independent parts (a
regular <code class="classname">BWindow</code> and a direct screen access context). The parts should
intermingle as little as possible. This split is necessary for two
reasons:
</p><p>
Reason #1: The direct window context lives in the present; <code class="classname">BWindow</code> lags
behind. The graphics state information you get from <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> is
guaranteed to be valid (within the limits defined by the protocol)
because the function is synchronized with the app server. <code class="classname">BWindow</code>, on the
other hand, is detached from the server by a mostly asynchronous protocol.
</p><p>
Reason #2: The two parts use entirely different protocols for
communicating with the app server. If you mix the protocols—in other
words, if you make normal <code class="classname">BWindow</code> calls from
within <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> --
you'll deadlock. If that happens, the app_server will look for any teams
that aren't responding to <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> calls within a reasonable
amount of time (a couple seconds), and kill them. (It's not pretty, but
at least you won't bring the whole graphics system down.)
</p><p>
Unfortunately, you have to use <code class="classname">BWindow</code>
(or <code class="classname">BView</code>) calls to get event
messages, so you can't shut out the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> world altogether. Just be
extremely careful to never use a "normal" <code class="classname">BWindow</code> call in a portion of
code that can block <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code>. Note that it's possible for the
Interface Kit and the Game Kit contexts to share the content area of a
window, but, again, you have to be very careful. We'll post some sample
code to the web site to demonstrate how to do it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676249"></a>BWindow or BDirectWindow?</h3></div></div></div><p>
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> is certainly a very powerful API, but at the same time it's
a tricky one. When you use the direct frame buffer access capability of
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>, you assume responsibility for two non-trivial operations:
You have to...
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Perform all drawing operations yourself (no drawing functions are
available to help you), and...
</p></li><li><p>
Respect the clipping region.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The first task usually means writing more drawing code (including
handling different frame buffer formats, which means recognizing
different pixel depths and endiannesses). The second task just makes the
first one much more complex, since you need to do both drawing and
clipping in one pass. This compounded complexity should weed out "casual"
development. (In the future, we'll work on a low-level API that combines
software and the hardware's accelerated functions to help you perform
these tasks, but for this release you're on your own.)
</p><p>
Furthermore, <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>s can be difficult to debug since a deadlock or
crash in the <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> function will force the app_server to kill
your team...which doesn't leave you much to debug. But, by design, only a
small portion of code should be executed in <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code>—it
should only change the drawing context, it shouldn't do the drawing
itself—so deadlocks and crashes should be rare.
</p><p>
We recommend <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>s for use in these four scenarios (only):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> is ideal if you're DMAing a stream of graphic frames
(like video) directly from another PCI card. It will be very fast,
will use barely any CPU cycles, will use your PCI bus more efficiently
and will get you a much smoother streaming.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> is also the way to go if you want to smoothly animate
a small number of pixels inside a big area of the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
If you need to guarantee that your animation (in general) is as
smooth as possible, <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> can give you *some* advantage. A
thread that's performing <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>-based animation is limited only
by scheduling issues and the frame buffer's bus bandwidth limitations,
whereas threads going through the app server are limited by the
client/server protocol and the server synchronization mechanism.
Nevertheless, in common cases this difference isn't perceptible, so
only people who really know what they're doing (and what they want)
should try to use BDirectWindow in this case (crazy geeks for example
:-).
</p></li><li><p>
The last scenario is a more specific application: If you're
creating an engine that processes an input stream to generate a big
graphic output stream (typically video), then you can benefit by
sending the output directly to the frame buffer instead of through an
off-screen buffer. The idea is that you'll avoid a useless pass
through the main memory system, and, in some cases, you'll also reduce
the bandwidth going through your L2 cache since you're reducing the
exchange between your L2 and your main memory system. This sort of
bandwidth reduction can significantly improve the overall performance
of the system. Also, since you have to do both processing and clipping
at the same time, this is a very nice way to implement lazy processing.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In all other cases, we strongly recommend that you either...
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Use the standard <code class="classname">BView</code> drawing function to draw directly on screen,
or...
</p></li><li><p>
Draw into a (main memory) off-screen buffer (i.e. a <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>) first,
and then blit the bitmap through <code class="classname">BView</code>'s
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code> function.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
An aside: One thing we *strongly* discourage is the reimplementation of
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>. You may think you've found some great trick that makes
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code> faster, or that extends its features, but by cutting
yourself loose from Be's drawing mechanism you lose any future
improvements that we incorporate into the system (due to graphic driver
architecture changes, for example).
</p><p>
In conclusion, we would like you to imagine what will happen when you use
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> in your applications. You will see ordinary apps that are
streaming live video, doing smooth pixel animation, doing real time lazy
video buffering, and certainly a lot of other cool effects (I'm scared
just thinking what our geeks are going to do with this :-). You will move
direct windows, resize them, superimpose them, switch resolutions on the
fly. For example, we tried 3 video windows streaming 30 fps, two 320x240,
one 640x480, 16 or 32 bpp, or 8 software animations in 400x300.
</p><p>
And the great thing is that it all looks like a "normal" graphics system;
The user won't notice that <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code> functions are being sent in
parallel, or that multiple threads are generating new DMA commands as the
window sizes change, or that interrupts are reprogramming DMA controllers
on the fly for every change...
</p><p>
And that's when innovation is at its best, when it gives us more of what
we want, but with a transparency that "hides" the machinery.

This week brings a bevy of topics from the BeDC and BeDevTalk.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676501"></a>Importing and Exporting Symbols</h3></div></div></div><p>
There was quite a furor on BeDevTalk over this topic following my last
Newsletter article previewing Release 3. Many of these concerns and
questions reappeared during various sessions at last week's BeDC. I
figured I'd take the opportunity to clarify our position regarding
importing and exporting of symbols, and to go into detail about the issue
overall.
</p><p>
First off, we are specifically discussing the exporting of symbols from
libraries (including add-ons), and the importing of those symbols into
applications. There are three different methods that work for both PPC
and x86, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Before detailing
these, however, we need to review some general issues that affect all of
them.
</p><p>
The main caveat is that on x86 whether a symbol is exported or imported
is determined at compile time, not link time. Furthermore, the very first
time a symbol is found determines whether it is imported or exported.
This is very important. If you want to import or export a symbol it's
important to specify it at the very beginning of your code. Any other
import or export specification is ignored.
</p><p>
Another caveat is that the import and export of symbols is compiler- and
linker-specific. A method that is supported in one compiler is not
guaranteed to be supported by another. For now, while only the Metrowerks
compiler and linker are available for the platform, this is not an issue.
But in the future, as more compiler vendors choose to support the BeOS,
this will become significant. Before questions about additional compiler
support start rolling in, we are actively pursuing the matter, but
Metrowerks will be our provider for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>
Importing symbols is of primary importance when linking against a
library. When you are loading an add-on you are explicitly finding the
symbols yourself, so they only need to be exported. Even when you are
dealing with a library, importing symbols from that library isn't
mandatory. On PPC, there is no need to declare any global symbols as
importable (although there is no harm either).
</p><p>
On x86, however, there is an advantage to declaring symbols importable:
speed. With the symbol declared importable, you need only a single
instruction to find the associated code. If the symbol is not declared
importable, two instructions are required. This slows down your code,
perhaps imperceptibly, but slows it nonetheless. We recommend explicitly
importing symbols, to gain the speed benefit on x86.
</p><p>
Now, on to the various import and export methods.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676567"></a>Export Files</h3></div></div></div><p>
The first and least compatible method for importing and exporting symbols
is through the use of export files. The theory behind this method is to
first compile the library and explicitly export all global symbols to a
text file. Then this text file is edited and used to define exactly what
symbols are imported or exported.
</p><p>
While this method works for both platforms, the format of the export
files differs across platforms. On PPC an .exp file is used, and on x86
either the CMD or <code class="filename">.def</code> file format is used. This requires a different
file for each platform, and these files require updating whenever new
symbols are needed for export. This could lead to a lot of management
issues.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676597"></a>#pragma export &amp; #pragma import</h3></div></div></div><p>
The traditional PPC method for exporting symbols is to wrap a group of
symbols in <code class="code">#pragma export on</code> and <code class="code">#pragma export reset</code>. These symbols are
then exported. This is what you are probably familiar with in your
current code. It works perfectly well with the current compiler (much
better than the export files, as the declarations are contained in your
current header or code files) and is much easier to keep updated.
</p><p>
There will be some amount of shuffling to make sure that the export or
import declarations are wrapped around the first declaration of the
symbols, but this system works well on both platforms. The shuffling
needed could either be a good deal of work, or not, depending on the
state of your current code. However, this method is unlikely to be
supported by different compilers for the BeOS, as <code class="code">#pragma</code>s are by
definition very compiler specific.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676637"></a>__declspec(dllimport) &amp; __declspec(dllexport)</h3></div></div></div><p>
As you may have heard by now, this is our recommended method for both
platforms. While it's not very pleasing aesthetically, <code class="code">__declspec()</code> does
have redeeming qualities. Foremost among them is that it is "the way," as
defined by a large, unnamed software company with close to 95% of the OS
market. Also, compiler vendors who cater to that market (and who are the
most likely candidates for new tools for the BeOS) already implement that
method. To put it plainly, most if not all development tools we are
likely to see ported to the BeOS will support this method.
</p><p>
Regardless of whether you choose to use <code class="code">#pragma export</code> or <code class="code">__declspec()</code>,
we recommend that you implement a forward declaration header file. This
file declares every global symbol to import or export from your library
or application. The file can then be included at the top of every file to
make sure that the first declaration of a symbol properly specifies its
import or export status. The declaration header file can easily handle
both import and export of the symbols.
</p><p>
Since you'd need to write this file from scratch we recommend that you
just use the <code class="code">__declspec()</code> format, to ease the move to other compilers in
the future. The real advantage of a forward declaration file is that it
is a single file that works on both platforms and explicitly declares
what will be exported, and it does not require any code changes when
something needs to be exported. A simple change to the header file and a
recompile does the trick.
</p><p>
As requested on BeDevTalk, here is an example application and library
that shows an example of using forward declaration files to control
export and import of symbols. It uses the multi-platform makefile I
mentioned in my last Newsletter article, updated for PPC for Release 3.
The makefile can be downloaded separately from the second link:

Another topic discussed at the BeDC was cross-compiling. The new
Metrowerks tools that will soon be available include PPC compilers and
linkers that produce x86 executables and x86 compilers and linkers that
produce PPC executables. To use these tools you need to copy over the
appropriate libraries from either x86 or PPC to link against.
</p><p>
At this point, we do not feel confident recommending the cross-platform
tools for a simple reason: testing. We haven't done enough testing at Be
to ensure that these tools work as they are supposed to, although
Metrowerks has done extensive tests. The main reason we are discouraging
their use, however, is that we feel developers need to adequately test
their own applications—on both platforms. If developers are going to
have both platforms available for testing, they might as well compile on
the appropriate platform and be done with it.
</p><p>
What we suggest for people who do not have access to both platforms --
especially our new x86 developers who might have difficulty obtaining
compatible PPC hardware—is that developers team up to make sure that
software is thoroughly tested before being released to the public. We
cannot state this strongly enough. There are enough byte order issues and
other problems to make testing both binaries exceedingly important—as
important as ensuring that both flavors of the BeOS have all of the same
applications available.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id676737"></a>Resource Conversion</h3></div></div></div><p>
My final topic concerns a failure on our part when producing the Release
3 CDs that will be available to you soon. In the documentation for Moving
from PR2 to Release 3, we discuss some rather limited resource conversion
tools rescvt_PPC and rescvt_intel. These tools extract the resource fork
from a PPC executable, perform some byte-swapping on its contents, and
convert the data to the x86 resource format. Full docs on their use are
in the above file. The problem is that the tools themselves can't be
found in /boot/beos/bin as noted. We forgot them.
</p><p>
So here they are:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/intro/obsolete/rescvt_ppc.zip
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/intro/obsolete/rescvt_intel.zip
</p><p>
Some quick reminders about these tools are in order. They are extremely
limited. They will convert and swap Application Info data, <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s,
Icons, mime-types, and not much else. Any developer-defined resources
will not be swapped or exported, and user-defined data in <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s may
be corrupted by this process. If you only use resources for basic
application information, these tools should work fine. If you use them
for anything else, you are much better off creating the tools from
scratch for x86.
</p><p>
We are working on a cross-platform resource format, and hope to have it
available by R4, but it is possible it might slip beyond that time.

We had a grand time last week at the BeDC, our developers' conference in
Santa Clara. In many respects, it was a coming out party or, if you
prefer, our first baby steps in the Intel world—well-received ones, it
seems. And today, I want to pay homage to someone who played a key role
in the development of our company and our product: Erich Ringewald.
</p><p>
Around this time last year, as Intel engineers moved into a cubicle in
our office and started working with us on the port, and as we were making
fund raising plans, Erich let me know he didn't see himself forever in
his combined CTO and VP of Engineering jobs. We started looking at what
this meant for him and for us, whether, for instance, he would some day
dedicate himself full-time to the CTO job.
</p><p>
A year later, the BeOS runs on Intel, we've raised about $26 million (we
got more investors in the last few days preceding yesterday night's "last
call"), and Erich has decided to get a taste of the consulting world.
I've always valued Erich's unique combination of technical and business
insights and I wasn't surprised when he told us he'd immediately found
two valuable assignments as a consultant.
</p><p>
I first met Erich at Apple. His office wasn't far from mine on the 3rd
floor of the De Anza III building in Cupertino, where he worked on
MultiFinder with Phil Goldman, now at WebTV. He later moved to Apple's
European R&amp;D group in Paris. That's where I met him during Christmas
1990, shortly after starting Be. He'd heard I was "doing something" with
Steve Sakoman, he was interested, he joined us, moved back to the US,
became the head of our software group, and built a small group of very
capable programmers who, in turn, built a small and very capable OS.
</p><p>
Erich sometimes jokingly referred to himself as a "cheap-seeking"
missile. I, personally, and the company, more generally, owe a great deal
to his penchant for parsimony, whether in furniture or in system
architecture. After years of working for a very rich employer, I needed
this kind of detox, and the company would have died from "rich"
architectural decisions. Erich fit very much the player-coach model we
wanted for executives in our company. He wasn't afraid to crawl under
desks to wire the company, observing that CTO really meant Chief
Telephony Officer.
</p><p>
In February 1994, AT&amp;T told us they weren't going forward with their
Hobbit microprocessor development. This meant Steve Sakoman's labor of
love, a two-CPU, three-DSP dream media and communications machine was
gone. Imagine you're the publisher and your author just lost his
manuscript. Lightning struck and the hard disk and the back-up are both
gone. What do you do? You tell the author this is a great opportunity:
the great novel is really in him, not on the disk, and this is his chance
to fix the problem that was bugging him with the main character, and to
rework the ending of chapter two. But it's highly unlikely the author
will have the psychic energy to restart from a blank screen. Steve didn't
believe he could build a new machine from a new processor again and left
Be, for a while, to go work at Zenith Data Systems and Silicon Graphics.
He rejoined us in 1996.
</p><p>
When Steve left, Erich took the reins. We hired Joe Palmer, who built the
BeBox on the basis of a design started by Glenn Adler, now at Phillips in
Holland. In the Fall of 1995, we made our debut at Agenda. Dave
Marquardt, who was to become our lead investor, was in the room when the
BeBox demonstrated by Steve Horowitz got a standing ovation. As a result,
we finally got support from premier Silicon Valley venture firms. The
rest is pretty much in the public record.
</p><p>
As you can see, when I wrote earlier Erich played "a key role in the
development of our company and our product," I wasn't embellishing the
facts. For this, and for many other more personal aspects of our
relationship, including his encyclopedic interests and nanosecond wit, I
am in Erich's debt, as is our entire company. We all wish him the best in
the next phase of a fulfilling professional life and hope he'll see fit
to give us the benefit of his insights from time to time.
</p><p>
And let's also wish success to our VP of Engineering, Steve Sakoman, who
helped cement our collaboration with Intel and who will lead us into
honoring the opportunity before us.

Fred Fish would like Be to come up with a better development tool
solution. He would like to see (at least) the following improvements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Fully documented file formats for objects, archives, executables,
and debugging formats.
</p></li><li><p>
Fully documented C++ runtime requirements and data layout
(exception support, vtables, etc.).
</p></li><li><p>
System include files that are non-vendor specific and are owned by
Be, so that Be has absolute control over making changes when necessary.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Mr. Fish goes on to nominate GNU as a reasonable solution.
</p><p>
Eric Berdahl thinks Mr. Fish is not out of water, but...,
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">These suggestions, while not out of line with Be's interests, do not
directly contribute to their business... Although it's far from optimal
for us developers, multiple executable formats and tool sets don't
prevent us from developing BeOS applications—it just makes it a little
bit harder.</span>”
</p><p>
And from Jon Watte:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">There is no such [binary/archive] format for which tools are readily
available, else it would probably have been done a long time ago... The
biggest problem with switching formats is not the switching itself, it's
finding compilers, linkers and debuggers that work with the new format on
BeOS.</span>”
</p><p>
There was some debate over the merits of the GNU formats and tools: Is
GNU/GCC/GDB a reasonable candidate for a universal solution.
</p><p>
Hamish Alan Carr turned the topic on its head: Rather than a single
universal solution, why not go for a universal accommodation:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...the ideal solution would be one in which the primary tool gave equal
support to the Unix way, the Mac way, and, yes, the Win95 way... I think
that what this means in practice is: Ability to run *multiple* executable
formats - let the market decide which is the best.</span>”
</p><p>
The thread then turned to technical issues: How similar to COFF is PE? Is
PEF the same as ELF? What changes would be needed at the kernel level to
support new (or multiple) formats?

The Release Notes for Release 3 mentioned resource conversion tools
called "rescvt_intel" and "rescvt_PPC". They don't seem to be on the CD.
What happened?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The resource conversion tools accidentally fell off the CD.
You should be able to get them from the web site; see Stephen Beaulieu's
article in this Newsletter for details.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id677046"></a>Subject: MouseMoved() again</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Why not 2 mouses?</h5></div></div></div><p>
More mouse event discussion, but first...
</p><p>
A CORRECTION: When last we met, the summary irresponsibly agreed with a
statement that a <code class="constant">B_MOUSE_MOVED</code> event is sent only once for every four
pixels of movement. There *is* a (private) heuristic that throws out
"excessive" mouse messages, but it *isn't* based on a hard pixel count.
</p><p>
The truth is this: You are guaranteed to get at least one mouse moved
event for every "burst" of mouse movement, regardless of how far the
mouse travelled; furthermore, you're guaranteed to get an event message
for the mouse's "at rest" location after a burst.
</p><p>
If the mouse moves slowly enough, you'll get a message for every pixel
the mouse touches. We apologize for the confusion.
</p><p>
Other questions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Are mouse coordinates in sub-pixel precision? (No)
</p></li><li><p>
Is <code class="methodname">MouseExited()</code> necessary? Some other view will receive a
corresponding <code class="methodname">MouseEntered()</code> (in which the cursor can be set), so it
isn't clear what <code class="methodname">MouseExited()</code> is supposed to do. It was argued that
this would mean that EVERY view would have to implement <code class="methodname">MouseEntered()</code>
to set the cursor.
</p></li><li><p>
Do non-active windows need to track the mouse? They do if they want
to special case the cursor for drag-and-drop.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In the meantime, Yukio Hirose proposed that the OS be able to handle
multiple mice. Christian Bauer found a bug in this notion...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...having two mouse pointers would also mean having two active windows
and unless you also have two keyboards, you have a problem deciding which
window receives keyboard events.</span>”
</p><p>
...but then solved the bug with hardware:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">On the other hand, if you _have_ two keyboards, two people could work on
one computer at the same time without the need for additional terminals
and that's something I really wish to have sometimes. If BeOS had support
for multiple monitors, this could even be a replacement for the lack of a
networked GUI for some applications.</span>”
</p><p>
Dave Haynie noticed that this sort of set up sounds a lot like a feature
of the Amiga OS:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">There was a central input.device task that managed a variety of general
purpose I/O. In came events, like moving a mouse, pen on a tablet, etc.,
maybe both at the same time. Out came 'cooked' formal event objects,
which could describe any kind of I/O event. All you would need is a
facility to manage a couple of this kind of event stream, and of course
an easy program option to select which event stream or stream the program
listens to.</span>”
