Let's say you witness odd behavior in your application. And let's further
assume that you suspect that the culprit isn't in your own code.
Moreover, you prove to yourself that it is, indeed, a bug in the
<span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™. You can work around the bug—perhaps at the expense of
performance—but you sure would sleep better at night if you had a
clean version of the OS. How do you get us (Be) to fix one of our own
bugs and release the improved OS? I'll tell you how. But first, let's
look at the Be release process.
</p><p>
We follow Metrowerks' release strategy of delivering new software four
times a year. That's a release every three months, which gives us just
enough time to make an appreciable improvement in the OS. In an ideal
world a release every other month—an almost constant, on-demand
release system—would be great. We actually tried it once, but found
that a monthly release schedule didn't leave much (any) time for testing
—and you thought DR7 was unstable. So for now, anyway, we'll try to
keep up with a three-month release cycle. This is pertinent to the
developer because as a rule, we only distribute bug fixes as part of new
releases.
</p><p>
Of course, bugs don't fix themselves; and within a single release cycle,
we many not even have time to fix all the bugs we can identify and
understand. So we have to do some filtering: We decide which bugs are
most important and which ones we (and you) can live with until the next
go-round.
</p><p>
We have a reasonably simple strategy for release content. In the first
part of the release cycle, we make a list of the features that we really
want to include—without regard for the time it would take to implement
them. The feature list is always longer than a novel. Then we look at
each feature, figure out how long it will take, and try to fit it into
the schedule of the appropriate programmer. This goes a long way in
cutting down the list. When we think we have a list of features that can
be managed in three months—given the talents and temperaments of our
engineers—we look at the list once more and lop off one feature from
each assignation. This is the sacrificial feature—the time that this
feature would have taken is devoted to fixing bugs. That's the theory.
</p><p>
Once a week we pull down the bug reports from the Be web site and
separate the good bugs (feature requests) from the bad bugs. We try to
reproduce each bad bug and to figure out the scope of its malfeasance --
does this bug merely hang a window, or does it kill an entire app? Does
it wedge the app server, crash the entire machine, crash all machines in
the same room, shut off the electricity to the building, or run around
the parking lot letting air out of car tires?
</p><p>
Having gauged a bug's severity, we argue over which ones we'll try to
fix. Once a week, seven of us enter a room and, a few hours later, at
least three of us are still talking to each other (it's astonishing how
much heat can be generated when you sit in a room and discuss bugs with
the programmers who imposed them). We mark bugs with four different
priorities: A priority 1 bug is important enough to hold up a release --
we won't ship until the bug is fixed. Priorities 2 and 3 mean we'll live
with the bug if we have to, but we'll be ashamed (priority 2) or merely
chagrined (priority 3). Priority 4 means the bug is deferred until next
time. On average we fix 180 bugs each release. That's pretty good for 13
engineers.
</p><p>
So now that you know where the ballpark is, here's how you play the game:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Submit your bugs and feature requests on our web site
(http://www.be.com/developers/bugform.html). As a rule of thumb, bugs
reported after the first four weeks of a release cycle must wait until
the next release.
</p></li><li><p>
Submit one bug per report. If it looks like there might be more than
one bug on a report, then someone over here (me) has to figure out how
many bugs are really there, which takes time and makes me grouchy.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're reporting a "bad bug" (as opposed to a feature request),
give us an easily reproducible case. We love it when there are steps to
follow or example source code.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're sending us a feature request or UI enhancement, please be
clear and precise about what you want. We have plenty of bugs that are
long-winded philosophical tracts (then again, if you're looking for an
essay for your Computer Interface Design 101 term paper, maybe we can
work a deal).
</p></li><li><p>
Bugs that crash apps (or, gasp, the machine) are pretty easy to peg.
But if a bug doesn't crash your app, try to tell us exactly what
adverse effect it does have. Sometimes we have a hard time assigning a
priority to a bug because we don't know why or how the bug affects you.
</p></li><li><p>
And the number one secret to getting your bug fixed, (drum roll
please...):
</p><p>
Send us your bug in the first place! If we don't know about it we
can't fix it. We really, really want to fix any and all bugs that keep
you from easily developing your application on the BeBox.
</p></li></ul></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-34"></a>Be Developer Talk: Piotr Pytlik of Double P Software</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Piotr</span> <span class="surname">Pytlik</span></span></div></div></div><p>
By day, I work as a software developer for Switchview Inc., a Canadian
telecommunications business. But at night, I become Double P Software,
developing programs for several clients in Canada and for developers on
PC and BeBox platforms. I've developed games, such as Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, Brain Dead 13 (Readysoft Inc), written problem-solving
applications (Waterloo Engineering Software), and built custom, real-time
control systems for high-resolution projection systems (Electrohome Ltd.).
</p><p>
I started in electronics when my uncle introduced me to
"Electronic-Logic," used for controllers of sorts. We built an entire
railway station: Tracks, trains, lights—all controlled in real time.
Then came the first microcomputers, Z80, ZX Spectrum, Commodore64/128,
Amiga, Pcs... and now the BeBox. Progressing from one to another I have
loved the possibility to be creative as a programmer, to create something
completely new. At school I was already programming on contracts for the
Academy of Art in Poland and then created special effects for the SFI
movie "Snake Valley."
</p><p>
I love the power of creativity that computers give me; but I need a
powerful, flexible programming environment that's driven by an
easy-to-use and powerful OS. I also need a system that allows various
peripherals for direct hardware control, that provides communications via
network or modem access to the Internet, and that's FUN to program and
use, intuitive and smooth (not like some "windows" are).
</p><p>
When a friend introduced me to the BeBox, I saw an opportunity to be a
part of a growing community and to be able to contribute to the new OS,
which is not a hog like some other systems. And the machine itself has
exactly what I need: Power, graphics, the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™, and for now at
least, relatively small competition.
</p><p>
I love the responsiveness of the GUI, the flexibility in using PC
peripherals, and the great ideas in the OS, such as the database. On the
other hand, I would like to see a few things change: For example, I
prefer an Explorer-like browser, rather than Mac-style folder windows.
Also, some parts of the window design are less than ideal: I would like
to be able to resize a window by grabbing any edge, for instance.
</p><p>
As for products that I'm thinking of producing: I would like to address
other software developers so the software base for BeBox can be much
bigger. I would also like to address the needs of Musicians by working on
MIDI software for controlling MIDI equipment (patch editors...) and sound
(accompaniment).
</p><p>
Other plans I have include porting the Timex Data Link communication
protocol, creating an add-on for a universal HTML parser/browser that
could be used for Web browsing and pop-up (balloon) help boxes for all
applications. I'd also like to integrate a web browser, mail client, FTP,
and user groups (Internet news) into a single shared package, so anyone
can take advantage of those facilities.
</p><p>
But in general, I'd like to share my experience in software development
and tools for programmers. I believe that the wheel should not be
re-invented so many times. Every single invention should be available to
everyone for immediate use and every developer could then concentrate on
new tools and inventions, allowing everyone to grow much faster.

Last time, I wrote about hardware unbundling and how it seemed to be
working just fine for our customers and for us. I also promised, or
threatened, to address the much thornier topic of software bundling in my
next mutterings. Alas, my two weeks are up and there is no escape; our
newsletter editor is a person not to be trifled with, and she combines
this with an elephantine memory, truly a formidable combination of
attributes. Resistance is futile.
</p><p>
Whereas hardware bundling stimulates powerful emotions, these pale into
insignificance compared to the reactions generated by software bundling.
In particular, application developers become very upset (and with good
cause) when hardware vendors begin to invade their turf by bundling
applications that compete directly with third-party products. Users may
like the idea of getting "free" software but, of course, it isn't really
free and it restricts competition in the long run.
</p><p>
Let's deal first with "shovelware." Shovelware is simply the practice of
including mostly tired old CD-ROMs, a few restricted apps, and the
obligatory free samplers for CompuServe and America Online with a
hardware platform, advertising it as "up to or more than $1000 worth of
free software." Unless you have a burning desire to browse the full text
of 1991's "Time" magazines or to play the first two levels of a 70-level
adventure game, you may find shovelware a little disappointing. If you
believe that it's worth $1000, please call me to discuss some real estate
opportunities I happen to have available for your investment dollars.
</p><p>
Needless to say, you won't be able to buy a BeBox with "up to $1000 or
more" of free software anytime soon. We ARE planning CD and on-line
software samplers, but we won't pretend that they take the place of real
applications.
</p><p>
A less common but more significant form of software bundling involves a
hardware vendor preloading usable, useful applications. Be's philosophy
on this is simple: Avoid competing with our application developers and
avoid giving one developer an unfair advantage over another. In practice,
this means that we'll include with our hardware all the basic software
required to provide a comfortable environment for developers and users
alike, but no more. Based on input from developers, we have included, or
will include, items such as standard graphics and networking APIs, a
simple text editor, and sound players. It can always be argued that by
including, for example, a MIDI player, we're competing with a developer
who could offer a better one if only we weren't unfairly excluding him or
her. Here we apply the "reasonable person" test and, yes, there are
always gray areas. Nobody would argue that we shouldn't "bundle" an API
for reading and writing files, nor would anybody argue that we should
bundle a full-featured video editing suite. There are many less clear-cut
examples, such as a web browser. This has become a requisite on all
computer platforms, particularly on the BeOS as all our on-line
documentation is, well, on-line, and in HTML format. In situations such
as this, we'll provide a "good enough" solution, leaving the field open
for developers with better, more extensive, or more innovative solutions.
It will be hard to please everybody all of the time, but we'll optimize
our approach to come as close to this as possible.

Before I jump into this week's topic, a correction. Two weeks ago I
discussed the opportunities for more interesting audio afforded by DVD,
referring to these opportunities as the A behind the V of the Digital
Video Disc. It turns out I was mistaken, not about the potential for
better audio, but about the V: It doesn't stand for video, but for
versatile. We agree. Others even find it a little too versatile.
Hollywood and other contents owners haven't yet reached an agreement with
DVD manufacturers on ways to protect their intellectual property from
DVD's versatility. We might have to wait a little longer for DVD sales to
take off, even if Toshiba bravely claims to be going ahead with an
October 96 release.
</p><p>
This week I'll discuss our e-mail client, included in the upcoming
Developer Release 8 of the BeOS. I expect we'll get questions or even
criticism for "bundling" an e-mail client, and I'd like to take this
opportunity to clarify our position on the matter. You might also want to
refer to my related article, "Bungling Bundling," in Issue 1-9 of this
newsletter (it's on our web site at
http://www.be.com/about_be/benewsletters/Issue09.html).
</p><p>
E-mail is so nice and useful we can't conceive of a personal computer
without it anymore. Windows 95 includes a mail client, the Macintosh had
the ill-fated PowerTalk, one of our engineers, Robert Polic, also an avid
and prolific contributor to this newsletter, wrote BeMail for the BeBox.
A question immediately comes to mind: Is this the first of many
third-party opportunities Be will take away from application developers
as the BeOS expands its capabilities? On the surface, yes, but a look
under the hood will convince you we're actually creating opportunities.
</p><p>
First, Robert wrote BeMail as an application. The mail client can easily
be replaced by a third-party application. Unlike what we've seen on
another platform, no hidden hooks, no hard-to-delete web client icon. One
might object it'll be hard to sell a third-party mail client while Be's
is "free," included with the BeOS. Eudora is a good counter example. They
offer a base level version for free and charge for the "Pro" client.
Exchange, included in Windows, doesn't prevent Eudora from selling well
on that platform. It's simply a much better, richer, nicer product—at
least I think so, I love it and I use it on my Pentium system as well as
on my Macs.
</p><p>
Second, to make e-mail matters more hospitable to developers, Robert has
built an e-mail API into our system, and anyone can use it to write
something better than BeMail, or more suited to particular needs, or
integrated into another application. Third, we'll go even further and
release the source code of our mail client as an example, illustrating
system features such as the database, the network, and drag-and-drop.
</p><p>
Hopefully, someone will shame us and write the next Eudora, or the next
Claris E-Mailer. That would make Robert proud, and he stands ready to
change his e-mail API to suit your creative drive.

information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads. To subscribe to
BeDevTalk, visit the mailing list page on our web site:

This thread, originally about file types (such as MIME) and later about
e-mail filters, swerved back into the file type lane. The logic behind
a hierarchical file type (as in MIME's "major/minor" typing scheme) was
described.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492325"></a>Subject: First Experiences</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should a CPU's idle thread go into "snooze" mode (instead of a busy
wait)? Would this degrade context switch performance when the CPU has
to wake up? It was agreed (sort of) that, yes, there would be a
performance hit, but some folks think that the hit could be acceptable,
given proper management.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492342"></a>WEEK 2</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492349"></a>Subject: First Experiences</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">A/K/A: Root Dir Proposal</h5></div></div></div><p>
The what-goes-into-root controversy narrowed
this week to volumes (should they be allowed to be mounted anywhere?)
and then turned into a discussion of OpenBoot. The proposal that
OpenBoot might solve a number of file system issues (specifically) as
it allows a solution to the more general problem of identifying and
mounting arbitrary devices was rebutted by the observation that
OpenBoot is "beneath" the file system layer. RDB ("Rigid Disk Boot"?)
was proposed as an alternative solution, or as a layer that would sit
on top of OpenBoot. But is RDB prone to viruses?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492364"></a>Subject: Internet-Based Updating System</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">A/K/A: Application Messaging</h5></div></div></div><p>
"Is it possible to have the BeOS automatically upgrade itself over the
internet?"
</p><p>
A lot of traffic in this thread: Some off-the-shelf solutions were
proposed (and objected to). The debate ranged between philosophy and
practice: Would daily updates (from Be) lead to daily bugs? Are
existing non-T1 lines fast enough to download an entire clean-slate
release? Can you download a kernel while you're running? And so on.
</p><p>
Uninstalling was also debated. The hottest question here, boiled to its
pith, was: Who should be responsible for keeping track of the apps that
share a common resource such that when all sharers are deleted the
resource is also deleted? Should the shared resource be deleted by
default or should it be a preference? How does an app declare the
resources (shared libraries most importantly) that it needs?

This thread started to address some of the same issues as the
"Internet-Based Updating System" thread, but then turned into a
discussion of how preferences should be stored and how apps should
apply them. Some folks want human-editable preference settings. Should
there be a standard format (X11 was suggested).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492425"></a>Subject: X11 Apps on Be</h4></div></div></div><p>
A call for X11 support.

A proposal for a "Settings Manager" was made. In it, user-by-user
preferences-like settings would be stored and managed (through add-ons,
optionally) as a system service. Each setting would be stored in the
database, keyed by the thing that's being described ("mouse speed," for
example) and user name. Looking up a setting, therefore, would only
require that you know the name of the "thing"; it wouldn't require a
specific C function.
</p><p>
The objection was made that such a system would be better implemented
as an ORB rather than as a manager.

Should the sound file format allow loop points (or AIFF marks)? Some
folks think that loop points are essential to playing "samples." Others
see it as a higher-level construct that would open the door to other
"essential" sound manipulations.

What happens when you report a bug? How do you track your report?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE (and I quote):
</p><p>
"You now get a bug tracking number for your bug... [The] bug number is
indeed a date-based YYMMDD-HHMMSS, because we wanted unique numbers
(and it gives us and you an idea of when it was filed).

...[B]ug reports definitely do not get sent into a Bottomless Pit, they
get placed in a bug-tracking database and every single one is
evaluated. Every [Be] engineer knows how many bugs they have..."

Also, see the "BE ENGINEERING INSIGHTS" article in this issue.

The question of how to get near-constant keyboard status was raised --
should you poll the keyboard? Some folks think that polling is always
bad; that if the resource that you want to monitor requires polling,
then the system is poorly designed. Others think polling has its place,
given that the "normal" solution (call-back functions) carries an
overhead of its own.

Most folks are pleased by the Game Kit and 3D Kit announcements and the
decision to support OpenGL. Some folks wondered that perhaps QuickDraw
should also be supported; and one lone voice wanted Be to create a
brand new format (which was countered by the argument that the 3D Kit
IS a brand new format).

This thread was an attempt to induce the Installer discussions from (at
least) two other threads. Instead, it became a discussion of
microkernels: Are they good? Is Be *really* a microkernel OS? What are
device drivers doing in there? Stayed tuned.
