The Bay Area is tied more precariously to the diurnal cycle than any
other location in the civilized world. Silicon Valley buzzes with geeks
staying up all night, hacking away at a problem to meet a beta release
deadline the next morning. Geeks on insanely optimistic production
schedules that are somehow met when entire companies pull twenty-hour
days for weeks at a time.
</p><p>
Now. Tell me why it is that at 2:00 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, as I sit
here writing sample code for all of my loyal readers (you're both still
out there, right?), I am unable to order a pizza from any of the lumpty-
zillion pizza places in the phone book, because they all stop delivery at
11 p.m.? It's probably the same reason why all movie theaters in the Bay
Area run their last show at 10:30 p.m. Huh? Am I the only one who is
mystified by this? If I had any brains at all, I'd get out of the
software business and open up a chain of 24-hour pizzeria/movie theaters.
</p><p>
Ah, there I go again. You'll have to excuse me. There are times in the
development cycle of any product when it just doesn't seem to be coming
together. You add feature after feature, fix bug after bug, insert
moronic Easter Egg after countless moronic Easter Egg, but the product
just doesn't seem to cohere. Its shiny surface, if you will, is not
congealing from the smelly, festering pit of your code base. These are
dark times for any developer. I have reached such a nadir.
</p><p>
The product, of course, is <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>.
</p><p>
Yes, <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>, the standard BeOS image editor,
much like "ed" is the standard UNIX text editor.
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span> is the standard by which all other
BeOS image editors are judged, and boy, are they all looking good!
</p><p>
Some of you may remember <span class="application">QuickPaint</span> from
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-28.html#Engineering3-28" title="Be Engineering Insights: Cop-Out">Be Engineering Insights: Cop-Out</a>
in which I introduced it as sample code. Since then, I've promised
sample code for using the new BeOS Release 4 features I wrote about in
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-45.html#Engineering3-45" title="Be Engineering Insights: That BeOS is one baaad mother-[Shut your mouth!] ...just talking 'bout BeOS">Be Engineering Insights: That BeOS is one baaad mother-[Shut your mouth!]
...just talking 'bout BeOS</a>
</p><p>
Could there be a better way to demonstrate these new features than
integrating them into the Be Developer Newsletter's own
<span class="application">Photoshop</span>-killer,
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span>? Probably! But I did it anyway!
</p><p>
Among the new <span class="application">QuickPaint</span> features are support for layers, anti-aliased
pen strokes, image import, and several new tools. Here's where to get it:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/graphics/QuickPaint.zip
</p><p>
You need R4 to compile and/or run it. The makefile included is strictly
bare bones and doesn't handle dependencies correctly (again, because I am
lazy) so you'll probably want to write your own makefile or use a BeIDE
project to make small changes, in order to be sure that all necessary
files are recompiled.
</p><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">UI</acronym> is easy enough to use, although completely un-self-explanatory.
Basically, you choose a tool and start drawing. The pen tool is now
anti-aliased and thick; other drawing tools also use thick pen sizes. The
two new tools are a transparentizing pen (the inverted pen icon) and a
"hand" tool to move layers around (that's the big X, because I didn't
want to bother coming up with an icon).
</p><p>
To add a layer, either hit
<span class="keysym">Alt</span>+<span class="keycap">L</span>
or choose it from the <span class="guimenu">Layers</span> menu, or
drag and drop an image onto <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>
from the <span class="application">Tracker</span>. You can also
choose <span class="guimenuitem">Add Image</span> from the <span class="guimenu">File</span>
menu and that image will be added in
another layer. The layer stack appears along the left side of every
editor window. To select a layer for drawing, left-click it; its button
will be pushed in, indicating the selection. To hide/show a layer,
right-click it. To change the order of the layers, left-click and drag
the layer button to the new location in the stack. Clickable arrows will
appear above or below the stack window if you can scroll to see more
layers.
</p><p>
The changes to the <span class="application">QuickPaint</span> sources are evident enough; the code has
bloated up to almost 3,000 lines. But in those lines you'll find
demonstrations of some of the coolest and most useful new app_server
features.
</p><p>
For instance, the new alpha-blending capabilities are used throughout the
program. You'll find usage of the "normal" <code class="constant">B_ALPHA_OVERLAY</code> blending mode
in <code class="filename">Layers.cpp</code> (to display the strike-out mark over the buttons of
nonvisible layers) and in BitmapDocument.cpp, where the layer composition
is done. The "weird" and more expensive <code class="constant">B_ALPHA_COMPOSITE</code> mode is
demonstrated in action in <code class="filename">ToolLib.cpp</code>, where the new anti-aliased pen
lives. To see why it's needed, change the mode to be <code class="constant">B_ALPHA_OVERLAY</code> and
draw a bit with the pen. Try drawing different colors on top of one
another in the same layer. The effect is interesting, but probably not
what you want. <code class="constant">B_ALPHA_COMPOSITE</code> preserves all the alpha information --
as you'd expect—and is designed explicitly for this kind of thing:
alpha-compositing images onto an offscreen-for-later alpha overlay.
There's also a bit of explicit manual fondling of alpha data in the
"hand" tool—layers that are dragged become translucent so you can see
the layers underneath for the duration of the drag. This is done by
manually setting the alpha values of pixels—an easy, safe, and useful
technique, as long as you're sure of your pixel formats.
</p><p>
Other new <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>s are scattered here and there.
The new <code class="methodname">ClipToPicture()</code> <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> is
used in a lightweight way to provide a mask for the strike-out marks on
the layer buttons that I mentioned above. The view transaction methods
are used in <code class="methodname">LayoutViews()</code> in
<code class="filename">Layers.cpp</code> while laying out the layer views
on the matrix buttons. All the interface controls and drawing tools are
now asynchronous (i.e., they don't do polling, but instead rely on
<code class="methodname">MouseMoved()</code> and <code class="methodname">MouseUp()</code>).
Among the drawing tools some choose to
receive pointer movement history and others choose to throw it away,
according to the needs of the specific tool.
</p><p>
Beware that there are bugs in some of the translators that improperly set
the alpha of pixels read from an imported file. The Be logo in the
SampleMedia folder, for instance, loads without problems, but as all the
pixels have an alpha of zero, the new layer appears blank. These bugs
will be fixed for R4.1. Also fixed for R4.1 will be the conspicuous
absence of alpha controls on the <code class="classname">BColorSelector</code>; in fact, the colors
returned by it are also incorrect and have the alpha set to zero.
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span> sets it back to 255 and does without translucent primitives
for now.
</p><p>
I welcome any feedback from developers about how useful all this
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span> nonsense is, and any questions
about how the new <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>s are used
in general or specifically in <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>. I'd also like to point out that
I haven't implemented any of the things I suggested last time as
"exercises for the reader," so you can simply merge all the code you've
written for those exercises to the new source base and be ready to rip!
Heh-heh-heh. Do you feel guilty? Good!
</p><p>
In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Ficus
Kirkpatrick to the growing, tightly integrated <span class="application">QuickPaint</span> Application
Suite Family. We here at <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>, Inc,. are proud to add Whack to our
offerings as the flagship product of our lucrative Really Cool Useless
Crap division. As a result of this merger, Ficus will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of me. He'll soon be available for bachelor parties and
bar mitzvahs; I'll keep you posted.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering3-51-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: Kernel Engineer Breaches Software's Iron Curtain
and Lives to Tell About It</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Ficus</span> <span class="surname">Kirkpatrick</span></span></div></div></div><p>
I don't often poke my head out above the Iron Curtain that divides user
and kernel space, but recently, I decided to wander over, see the sights,
and visit the people.
</p><p>
Benoît had written a series of programs that would display something cool
on the screen. They were all derived from the same skeleton: constantly
iterate over the frame buffer, and calculate the value of each pixel
based on its location. The only variation between these programs was the
expression in the inner loop.
</p><p>
I experimented with making my own programs like this for a while, but got
tired of constantly recompiling. "It would be excellent," I mused, "if I
could just type the expression in a window." I came up with a solution
that should simultaneously galvanize and repulse true believers of the
Holy Grail of software engineering: code reuse. Employ what is already
the best expression parser and optimizer in the system: the C compiler!
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/game_kit/Whack.zip
</p><p>
Whack does lots of interesting things, but the highlight is that it
generates its own drawing code and loads it on the fly. Whack also makes
use of <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>, <code class="classname">BRoster</code>'s
running app list update mechanism, and
the <code class="constant">B_SIMPLE_DATA</code> Drag-and-Drop protocol. It does lots of multithreading
and everything else a good Be application should do.
</p><p>
The user interface is simple. There's a menu bar at the top of the
window, an area in the middle for viewing the plotting of your
expression, and an area at the bottom to enter it. You can save add-ons,
drop them into the window, and add the ones you like to a list of
favorites.
</p><p>
In the directory Whack runs from, there's a file called <code class="filename">template</code> that
contains the code for a <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> drawing loop, but with
<code class="code">__EXPRESSION__</code> in place of the real one. All Whack has to do is insert a
preprocessor directive indicating what the expression should actually be
and compile it.
</p><p>
What makes it look cool is that the variables you use in your expression
change depending on the position of the pixel it is being evaluated for,
time, frame count, etc. The variables available to use are:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="varname">x</code>   The screen-relative X coordinate of the current pixel.
<code class="varname">y</code>   The screen-relative Y coordinate of the current pixel.
<code class="varname">ix</code>  The window-relative X coordinate of the current pixel.
<code class="varname">iy</code>  The window-relative Y coordinate of the current pixel.
<code class="varname">f</code>   A number incremented once per frame.
<code class="varname">t</code>   Time (actually, a number incremented once per pixel).
</pre><p>
One of the really interesting effects you can achieve is by using the
screen-based and window-based position variables together and then moving
the window around. Give it a try.
</p><p>
There are a few things missing from Whack. I didn't have time to
implement support for anything other than 32 bits per pixel, but the
space is there for you to fill out, if you're so inclined. You just need
to convert the value generated by the expression from 32-bit RGBA to your
desired bit depth.
</p><p>
So, what's the alpha channel used for? The extremely simple drawing loop
doesn't do any blending. Somehow it didn't seem right to be taking that
extra byte of memory and not making any use of it. You may have heard of
QuickPaint, the industry standard for paint programs that is the subject
of George's Newsletter articles. I decided to apply to the <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>
Developer Program and see how I could integrate that extra unused byte
from Whack into <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>'s new alpha-blending feature.
</p><p>
Try running both programs at once, and notice that you can send the
current frame of <span class="application">Whack</span> to
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span> as a new layer. "QuickPaint and
Whack have achieved a level of synergy between two applications unmatched
on any platform," said George Hoffman, CEO of <span class="orgname">QuickPaint, Inc</span>.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it requires a little work on the part of the expression
writer to make the <span class="application">Whack</span> frame show up
correctly in <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>. Take, for
example, a boring expression like <code class="code">x+y+f</code>, and try sending it to
<span class="application">QuickPaint</span>. The problem is that an alpha value of zero means no opacity.
Now try <code class="code">(x+y+f)&amp;0xff000000</code>. If you're really clever, you can probably
figure out how to achieve partial opacity.
</p><p>
I feel somehow wiser after this venture into the world of writing user
programs, but I think I'll head back over the fence again.
</p><p>
See you next time!

A journalist friend of mine (staked out in Washington—you want
stories?) wrote to me recently to ask if I had heard of a time variant CD
player. He wants to play his CDs at a slower rate, but without changing
the pitch. Can such things be? With a computer, sure. But as a black box,
I doubt it. If anyone knows better, send me a note; the fourth estate is
waiting. Moreover, even the computer solution as it's implemented by
commercial sound editors isn't really good enough, because while a
computer can listen, it can't hear. My response, which doubles as a
gauntlet tossed to the charging Turks, follows.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Tom,
</p><p>
Although it's certainly possible to shift time without
changing pitch (or, conversely, to shift pitch without
changing time—the general solution is the same), there is
a problem of quality. The easy solution (typically involving
an FFT, a shift, and an inverse FFT) takes the original
sound and shifts the entire thing without regard for the
sound itself. The more correct solution, but one that is
very hard to apply generally, tries to "understand" the
sound and then modulate the amount of the shift accordingly.
An example is called for: Speak this sentence normally. Now
speak it slowly. The difference is like this:
</p><p>
Normal: Speak this sentence...
Slow: Speeeeeeeak thiiiiiiiis seeeeenteeeeeence....
</p><p>
The difference between a fast talker and a slow talker is
heard in the vowels, not in the consonants. Think of the
difference between a New Yorker and a Georgian (or, better,
a Hollywood Georgian—or a Hollywood British Georgian such
as Vivian Leigh or Leslie Howard). The Georgian doesn't
stretch the entire sentence, he "sings" the vowels. The easy
(and low quality) time shifter shifts the entire sound
equally, thus:
</p><p>
Ththththiiiinnnnnkkkk ooooffff ththththiiiissss.....
</p><p>
Even if you were to hold the pitch steady, your brain would
hear the sentence as having been mangled: It would become
somewhat unintelligible. This is because almost all spoken
information is encoded in the consonants.
</p><p>
Try to say this (whispering is your best bet, although the
voiced "n"s are a bit of a problem): "thnkfthssntnc." You
should still be able to understand what's being said. Now
try voicing just the vowels (and we'll throw the "n"s in
here as well to be fair): "inoienen". No information at all
-- as speech, it's entirely meaningless.
</p><p>
The point, here, is that when you play with the consonants
in speech, you're messing around with the part of the sound
that carries almost all of the (factual) information.
(Vowels *do* carry emotion, but that's a different sort of
information.) Certain phonemes, such as "s", the leading
"t", and the final "ck" can survive a time shift reasonably
well. But others are transformed, and some, such as almost
all instances of "d" and some of "p", seem to disappear.
</p><p>
The problem in music isn't as bad, since music "information"
is primarily "vowels". But you can imagine the havoc that
shifting time would visit on, say, a drum solo. When you
slow down drums, you want to increase the space between
attacks, you don't want to actually slow down the drum sound
itself. Similarly for piano: If you slow down a piano's
natural damping trajectory (the rate at which the note dies
away), you lose the "pianoness" of the sound. Going the
other way is worse. Speed up a recording of a piano (without
changing the pitch) and you'll quickly turn your baby grand
into a toy, and then into some bastard glockenspiel that
makes my teeth ache.
</p><p>
Shifting pitch while holding time constant has its own set
of problems, but they're difficult to characterize. When you
shift pitch, you alter timbre. The sound doesn't become
unintelligible, but it does change in ways that you might
not anticipate. For example, if you shift the pitch of the
spoken word, you'll have a hard time identifying the speaker
(modulo distinctive vocal tics), not because of the pitch
change, but because of the change in timbre. (Interestingly,
shifting the pitch of the spoken word doesn't entirely
obscure the sex of the speaker, because sex is encoded in
the way the individual resonances move.) In theory, shifting
pitch while maintaining time doesn't affect the consonants,
so you'll still be able to understand what's being said --
but even the theory breaks down if you shift too far. What's
"too far"? It depends on a lot of things, but shifting
inside a (musical) third is okay, a fifth is marginal, an
octave is far too much.
</p><p>
Now for the smart (time-shifting) solution: Here we try to
figure out which part of the signal is noise (drums,
instrument noise, consonants) and which part is "music"
(pitches, vowels). In a recording of a single speaker, or a
single instrument playing a single line, the detection is
pretty easy. But if you have more than one voice, it's
nearly impossible. If you can separate noise from music, you
can shift the part that you want: Slow down the vowels but
not the consonants. You can even mix and match: One of the
most ear-boggling audio demos I've ever heard is of a piano
that sounded like a cow...
</p><p>
While working at Stanford, a fellow named Xavier Serra
developed software that could separate noise from music
given a single voice source. As a demo, he took a recording
of a piano and removed all musical information, leaving just
the sound of the piano action (which is a significant part
of a piano's "message"). He replaced the piano "music" with
a recording of a herd of cows.
</p><p>
The effect was astonishing—it really sounded like
somebody was playing a piano that had cows instead of
strings. And not in the "Jingle Dog" style where a song is
"sung" by pitched recordings of animal noises. The piano/cow
was like nothing I'd ever heard—and then he played the
piano/rain, and the rain/piano, and the rain/man, and so on.
Interestingly, when he played the piano "music" by itself --
in other words, the piano recording with all the noise
removed—the effect was sickening. The pitches were all
there, but it was lumpishly cold. The recording of the piano
action was vastly more musical.
</p><p>
Sincerely,
etc.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As far as I know, there's been no breakthrough in polyphonic detection
and analysis in the last ten years. But you'll correct me if I'm wrong.
Better, write an app that merges animals and instruments. A cow piano is
impressive...but just think of the duckulele.
