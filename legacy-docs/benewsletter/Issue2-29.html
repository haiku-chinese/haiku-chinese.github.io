If I had a dime for every time I've fixed a bug caused by memory
corruption, I'd be a rich man. Memory corruption bugs come in many forms,
sizes and shapes, and sometimes they even come disguised. I've seen
blatant memory corruption bugs and some so subtle that it takes weeks to
track them down. Fixing these kinds of bugs wears you down, makes you
curse like a sailor and is known by the state of California to cause
heart trouble among otherwise healthy young programmers.
</p><p>
Good tools enable you to track down memory corruption bugs more easily.
Under the BeOS, enabling the first line of defense against memory
corruption errors is as simple as typing the following line in the shell:
</p><pre class="screen">
export <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code>=1
</pre><p>
Then run your application from that Terminal window. You can also enable
this feature in the Metrowerks debugger by choosing "Launch with <code class="function">malloc()</code>
debugging" in the BeOS PPC panel of the debugger preferences dialog.
</p><p>
If your code is clean, running with <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> will do nothing.
However, if you accidentally reuse free memory, overwrite the end of a
piece of allocated memory, free something twice, or scribble before the
beginning of a block, the debugger will pop up with an assertion
informing you of what happened. Further, when <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> is on, all
newly allocated memory will contain garbage values and when you free a
piece of memory it is again filled with (different) garbage data. This
level of protection catches the most common memory corruption problems
and the associated stack crawl will almost invariably lead you to the
culprit code.
</p><p>
I believe that every single BeOS application should endure some amount of
testing under the effects of <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code>. This will prevent you from
shipping bugs that are easy to fix and will make for more robust
applications. If an app crashes with <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> turned on the app needs
fixing.
</p><p>
And let me preempt the usual objections here: If your app crashes with
<code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> on, it is not because of a bug in the malloc debugging code.
Given that I wrote the malloc debugging code (and that it is rather
simple code) I will stake my reputation on the fact that it is bug free
and offer a reward if anyone finds a bug in it (reward details yet to be
determined). We've used <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> a fair bit internally at Be and it
has caught numerous bugs.
</p><p>
Some memory corruption bugs slip right through the safety net of
<code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> and cause problems. These bugs require more sophisticated
techniques to catch. For example, suppose an app allocates 64 bytes of
memory, uses it, and then frees it but accidentally keeps a pointer to
the block around. If at some later point the app again allocates 64 bytes
of memory, begins to use it and then the pointer from the first
allocation is also used (in the context of the first allocation), the use
of the pointer in the context of the first allocation will corrupt the
data of the second memory allocation. And because the second allocation
happened, there is nothing that the <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> code can do to catch the
problem.
</p><p>
This style of bug is particularly difficult to track down because
frequently the second memory allocation will be for the same type of
object and the misuse of the first pointer usually over-writes the memory
with similar values. Lest you think this example contrived, this exact
bug arose while working on the BeOS disk buffer cache management routines.
</p><p>
The solution that will catch this problem is sometimes known as a
"purgatory list." The basic concept is that when an app calls <code class="function">free()</code>, the
memory is filled with garbage but <code class="function">free()</code> is not really called. Instead of
being <code class="function">free()</code>-ed, the memory is added to a "purgatory list" where it is
held until some time in the future when <code class="function">free()</code> is really called. Holding
the memory in "purgatory" prevents the above problem because if the first
pointer were reused, the memory would still be in the purgatory list and
would likely cause a crash since it would contain garbage.
</p><p>
Implementing a purgatory list isn't particularly difficult but there are
a few issues to be aware of. The first problem is of course how do you
get your routine to be called on every <code class="function">free()</code>. I normally add <code class="code">#define</code>
macros that redefine <code class="function">malloc</code>, <code class="function">free</code>,
<code class="function">realloc</code>, <code class="function">calloc</code>, and <code class="function">strdup</code> to call
suitably renamed routines which you implement and use to call through to
the real versions of <code class="function">malloc</code>, <code class="function">free</code>, etc.
</p><p>
If the <code class="code">#define</code> macros are put in a commonly included header file for your
project then all your code will call your new routines. These new
routines must manage a list of allocated memory blocks and decide when to
call <code class="function">free()</code> for real. The most common solution is to have a circular
buffer of allocated memory blocks and to only call <code class="function">free()</code> for the oldest
items in the circular buffer. Of course because this list is shared
between multiple threads it must be semaphore (or even better, benaphore)
protected.
</p><p>
The size of the circular buffer affects how long items stay on the list,
which affects how much memory your program uses as well as whether or not
an item will still be in "purgatory" when the bug happens. You must weigh
the added memory usage against the likelihood that the bug will not show
up. If you have a purgatory list of 128 items it's fairly likely to catch
most bugs. Of course knowing details of the particular instance of the
bug may allow you to only track allocations within a certain size range.
In the degenerate case you can of course choose to never really call
<code class="function">free()</code>, just to see what effect it has on your program.
</p><p>
Although it would be convenient, <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> does not currently
implement a purgatory list. There were several reasons for this, most
importantly that a purgatory list requires a fair bit of internal state
that I did not feel was appropriate to add to the standard C library.
Plus, the added overhead becomes even more noticeable for most programs,
which may not need it. It is still possible to add, however, and if there
is enough clamor, it will likely happen (although enabling it would
require setting <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> to a specific value).
</p><p>
Barring even more sophisticated techniques which require rewriting object
code to maintain information about every memory reference (i.e. Purify),
these techniques can help you catch a good number of memory corruption
bugs. Using <code class="envar">MALLOC_DEBUG</code> can help you catch most of the common memory
corruption bugs that people make. Sometimes however you have to pull out
the big guns and implement a purgatory list to catch the more difficult
bugs.

When I was in high school I ran track. I was a distance man, not one of
those wimpy sprinter types who can only run for 100 meters and then have
to stop. Running long distance takes a lot of stamina, perseverance,
concentration, and of course strength.
</p><p>
Running a one mile or a two mile race is a very funny thing. You kind of
start out slow and in a pack with the rest of the runners. As the laps
wear on, you stratify and end up smaller packs, the winners and the
non-winners. Our coach would sit at the last turn of the last lap, 200
meters from the finish, and when we came by he would shout "Kick it
in!!". That was our signal to dig down into our reserves of energy and
"kick" like mad for that last 100 meters to win the race...most of the
time at least.
</p><p>
That's how I feel whilst programming as a new developer's conference
approaches. You're busy creating demo code, answering questions, doing
tutorials, and when you think you can't stay up until 4:00am one more
time, that voice in your ear yells "Kick it in!!".
</p><p>
When I bought my first BeBox way back when, I had a dream of supporting
some killer 3D libraries to do some nifty live 3D animation for
presentations. I got the source for the 3Dfx glide library way back then
and got it working in DR5/6/7.
</p><p>
Then I joined Be and got real busy. Along comes Geoff Woodcock who is
like a puppy who knows how to program saying, "I want to do a driver, I
want to do a driver!!" Well, being DTS it stands to reason that we should
be able to do at least one of everything our system supports, so I kicked
the disk over to him. He tore out what little hair he had left and...now
we have the 3Dfx glide library running in the Preview Release!
</p><p>
For those of you that don't know, 3Dfx is one of those companies that
manufactures 3D accelerator chips for the PC market. They are
particularly interesting because they also supply chips to many arcade
game consoles. They have arguably one of the best chip sets out there
today for the consumer marketplace. And now this chip set is supported by
the BeOS:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/glide.zip
</p><p>
What can you do with it? The glide library itself is pretty raw. It does
the initialization and setup of the board, and very basic drawing
primitives. You are responsible for manipulating your geometries and the
like, just like with OpenGL®. Speaking of which, now that we have this
accelerator, can we have accelerated OpenGL®...?
</p><p>
Another thing that got me all hot and bothered about my BeBox was the
infrared ports. I had visions of being able to control various home
devices, and my various BeBox operations from a remote control. Well, due
to certain events around here, I ended up doing some software to support
a IR device that attaches to the serial port:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/cs8130.zip
</p><p>
This is a program that allows you to manipulate the Crystal Semiconductor
CS8130 IR chip. Like the BeBox, this thing can read and play back
infrared signals. You could also, by the way, use it for IRDA as well for
data transfers, but that's another story. The included software makes it
pretty easy to train the device to recognize any remote, and then to
subsequently wait for commands to come in and do something with them.
Pretty neat stuff.
</p><p>
When the beloved BeBox was laid to rest, we lost MIDI, infrared, and the
Geek Port. But now we've regained MIDI, infrared and maybe soon we'll get
ADB/IO with the help of BeeHive (http://www.bzzzzzz.com/). Who knows,
stranger things have happened, and our aforementioned puppy's hankering
to do an ADB tutorial.
</p><p>
The Boston Be developers conference is just around the corner, and more
importantly the great BeOS Masters' Awards computer give away is looming
large. So in the words of Steve Boaz, KICK IT IN!!!
