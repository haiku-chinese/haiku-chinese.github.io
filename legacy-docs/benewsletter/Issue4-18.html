In an earlier newsletter, Ficus wrote an interesting article about how to
get high-resolution timing in the BeOS using a clever hack and a device
driver ("<a class="xref" href="Issue3-27.html#Engineering3-27" title="Be Engineering Insights: Porting WinSock Applications to the BeOS">Be Engineering Insights: Porting WinSock Applications to the BeOS</a>").
Thanks to a number of changes in Genki, this sort of black magic is no longer
necessary. The kernel now offers several ways to get fine-grained,
precise timing both from device drivers and user space.
</p><p>
The sample code
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/drivers/pcspeaker.zip demonstrates just
how fine-grained you can get. The code is a driver for the built-in PC
speaker. If you have a file in mono 8-bit unsigned 20k raw format, you
can <code class="command">cat</code> it directly to
<code class="filename">/dev/audio/pcspeaker</code> to play it. In lieu of that,
I've included a 'sine' program that writes a sine wave to stdout, which
can be redirected to this device. This was tested on a 333Mhz Pentium II.
On slower machines, you may have to tweak the values to keep the machine
usable.
</p><p>
The PC speaker is a primitive piece of hardware. It basically has two
states: on and off. You can drive it from a programmable rate generator,
or you can directly modify the state by setting a bit. The classic way to
mimic analog signals with this type of speaker is to pulse it very
quickly—faster than the speaker cone can physically move. The amount
of time that current is applied to the output vs. the amount of time that
it is not applied is controlled by the amplitude of the input signal,
causing the speaker position to approximate the actual waveform. The
sample driver will use this technique if it is compiled with the
PLAY_IN_BACKGROUND macro set to 0. The down side to this approach is that it
requires constant attention from the CPU. In order to get any kind of
sound quality, you have to shut off interrupts, rendering the machine
unusable. This is clearly undesirable.
</p><p>
The sample code takes a rather unique approach to this problem. It
programs a timer to wake it up periodically so it can move the speaker
cone. Other threads continue to run normally, but at defined intervals,
an interrupt occurs and the speaker driver code is executed (at interrupt
level) to control the speaker.
</p><p>
To get any quality, the interrupts need to occur frequently; around every
30-60us. Note that, although the machine is still useable, interrupting
this frequently cuts down performance quite a bit. This is a rather
extreme case, but it does illustrate how fine- grained you can get with
kernel timers. You should also note that the standard user space
synchronization primitives use this underlying mechanism, and you can now
get very accurate delays using system calls such as snooze, read port
etc, or acquire sem etc. You don't need to write a device driver to get
accurate timing.
</p><p>
From the driver level, the timers are programmed by using a new API added
for Genki. The declarations for these functions are in
<code class="filename">KernelExport.h</code>.
Programming a timer in a device driver basically involves calling the add
timer function, like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">ret</code> = <code class="function">add_timer</code>((<span class="type">timer*</span>)&amp; <code class="varname">my_timer</code>, <code class="varname">handler_function</code>, <code class="varname">time</code>,
    <code class="constant">B_ONE_SHOT_ABSOLUTE_TIMER</code>);
</pre><p>
The first parameter is a pointer to a timer structure. You can add your
own parameters to this by defining your own structure and making kernel's
timer struct the first element, for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">my_timer</span> {
    <span class="type">timer</span> <code class="varname">kernel_timer</code>;
    <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">my_variable</code>;
        .
        .
        .
};
</pre><p>
The second parameter to the add timer function is a hook function that
should be called when the timer expires. It has the form:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="function">timer_hook</code>(<span class="type">timer *</span><code class="parameter">t</code>);
</pre><p>
Note that the timer struct that you originally passed to add timer is
also passed into this function, so you can access elements that you've
added to that struct from the interrupt handler.
</p><p>
The third parameter is the time that this interrupt should occur. How
this is interpreted is determined by the fourth parameter. There are
three basic modes that a timer understands:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_ONE_SHOT_ABSOLUTE_TIMER</code>, as the name implies, is a single interrupt
that occurs at a specific system time.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_ONE_SHOT_RELATIVE_TIMER</code> is similar, but allows you to specify an
interval rather than an actual time.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_PERIODIC_TIMER</code> will cause the callback to be called repeatedly at a
given interval.
</p></li></ul><p>
When playing in background mode, the speaker driver determines the next
time the speaker cone has to move and program a timer for that time. If
it's under 20us, it doesn't actually program the timer. This is because
there is some overhead to handling an interrupt. If you program a timer
that's too short, you may end up wasting time and be late for the next
event you want to handle. Likewise, when it sets up the interrupt, it
will set it a little early to compensate for the interrupt latency. A
macro called SPIN determines whether the code will spin in a loop when it
is early to handle event, or just move the speaker cone early. In the
case of the speaker driver, which is obviously not a high- fidelity
component, this isn't really necessary. In fact, since these interrupts
occur so frequently, machine performance is degraded significantly when
it behaves like this. In drivers where timing is critical, spinning like
this is a way to be accurate.
</p><p>
A quick note about the implementation of timers. You may be familiar with
the way timing is implemented on many operating systems (including BeOS
before Genki). Normally, an operating system sets up a periodic interrupt
that occurs every couple of milliseconds. At that time, the timeout queue
is checked to see if there are expired timeouts. As a consequence, you
can't get a dependable resolution of less than the interrupt period. In
Genki, the kernel dynamically programs a hardware timer for the next
thread to wake or sleep, allowing much finer resolutions. This, coupled
with the preemptive nature of the kernel, is what allows the driver to
accurately set timers for 30-60us.
</p><p>
When it finishes playing a chunk of data, the interrupt handler releases
a semaphore that the calling thread was waiting for. Normally, when a
semaphore is released, the scheduler is invoked to wake up threads that
may have been waiting for the semaphore. As you're probably aware,
rescheduling from within an interrupt handler is very bad. Driver writers
must use the flag <code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> when releasing a semaphore from an
interrupt handler. This, by itself, was a limitation, however, because it
meant that a thread waiting for some device driver call has to wait until
the scheduler is invoked again (for some unrelated reason) before it will
be run. This can be several milliseconds later. Generally, you want it to
run as soon as possible.
</p><p>
In Genki, an interrupt handler can now return <code class="constant">B_INVOKE_SCHEDULER</code>, which
call the scheduler immediately after your interrupt handler returns. If
you have released semaphores from an interrupt handler, you can return
this to make sure that waiting threads are woken up soon. This is
especially useful for drivers where low-latency access to hardware is
important.

As anyone who sat through the Node Track of the recent Be Developers
Conference can attest, writing Media Kit nodes is a complex task. Be's
engineering team has been hard at work extending the Media Kit APIs to
simplify node construction; similarly, <acronym class="acronym">DTS</acronym> has been developing tools
developers can use to debug their own <code class="classname">BMediaNode</code>s. This week's article
introduces a tool for analyzing the behavior of any <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> node
or node chain: the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code>. Designed to work with the Genki/6
beta release (I told you the <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>s were under construction!), this node
tracks the behavior of its input stream, logging a trace of all activity
to a file for post-mortem analysis.
</p><p>
Before I discuss what exactly the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code>
does, here's the <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym> to
download it, so that you can follow along at home:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media kit/LoggingConsumer.zip
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id785150"></a>So, What Is This "LoggingConsumer" Anyway?</h3></div></div></div><p>
As <code class="classname">BBufferConsumer</code>s go,
<code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> is pretty simple: it doesn't
manipulate its input buffers in any way, it doesn't talk to hardware, and
it doesn't pass buffers downstream—it sits at the end of the node
chain. It has a single input, which can accept any kind of data. You, the
developer, connect to a node or node chain that you're interested in,
point it at an output file entry ref, and voilà! Useful information about
buffer flow and internode handshaking is recorded for later
interpretation.
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> node serves two purposes: it
produces a trace of node activity, for the purpose of debugging producers
and producer/filter node chains; and it serves as a clean example of
<code class="classname">BBufferConsumer</code> structure and behavior. The node
tries to do everything "right," and is commented to help you
understand what's going on at all points in the code. The node uses the
latest and greatest <code class="classname">BMediaEventLooper</code> class. It
publishes a set of controllable parameters via a
<code class="classname">BParameterWeb</code>, and handles the
<code class="constant">B_MEDIA_PARAMETERS</code> buffer type for changing those
parameters. It reports late buffers to the producer, and reports latency
changes as well. In short, it demonstrates pretty much all of the major
functionality that a <code class="classname">BBufferConsumer</code> has to worry
about.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id785214"></a>So, How's It Work?</h3></div></div></div><p>
In order to preserve the realtime behavior of a proper Media Kit node,
the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> doesn't do any disk access from within its main
<code class="classname">BMediaNode</code> control thread. Instead, it spawns a separate thread to write
logged messages to disk, and passes messages to that thread via a kernel
port. The LogWriter class encapsulates this pattern, managing the
non-realtime thread and message port transparently to the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code>
node implementation.
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> itself is another example of using the new
<code class="classname">BMediaEventLooper</code> class to handle most of the nitty-gritty details of
being a node. Because it does very little actual media-related
processing, it's a pretty clear illustration of the organization we
recommend that nodes use. The example application, which hooks the
LoggingConsumer up to an audio file reader, also uses a simple
"Connection" structure to illustrate the necessary bookkeeping for
setting up and tearing down the connection between two nodes.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id785262"></a>What's It Give Me?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Lots. Every virtual entry point a media node has generates an entry in
the log file (with the minor exception of <code class="methodname">GetNextInput()</code> and
<code class="methodname">DisposeInputCookie()</code>—and you can add support for these easily). Log
entries are marked with the current real time (i.e., <code class="function">system_time()</code>) when
they are generated, as well as the current time according to the
LoggingConsumer's time source. Some operations log additional
information, as well. For example, when a buffer is received, the logged
message will indicate whether it is already late. When a buffer is
handled (i.e., popped off of the BMediaEventLooper's event queue) the
buffer's performance time is logged, as well as how early the buffer was
handled. That "offset" needs to lie within the node's scheduling latency;
if it doesn't, the buffer is late. The node also maintains a count of
late buffers, so your testing application can follow what's happening.
</p><p>
<code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> is a <code class="classname">BControllable</code>,
too, and you can manipulate certain
aspects of its behavior while it's running. In particular, you can adjust
its latency on the fly. Reacting to latency changes is one of the
trickier aspects of <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> nodes, so having this facility in the
buffer consumer lets you test a producer in a reliable, repeatable
fashion. Future versions of the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> will have other
controllable features as well, such as the ability to change media
formats on the fly.
</p><p>

The <code class="varname">realtime</code> field is the current
<code class="function">system_time()</code> at the moment the message was logged,
and <code class="varname">perftime</code> is the
<code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code>'s idea of the current time according
to its time source (i.e., the current performance time). As you can see,
the node is registered, then the format negotiation with the producer
occurs, the node is <code class="methodname">Preroll()</code>ed, then it's
<code class="methodname">Start()</code>ed. When the producer node was started it
sent a <code class="methodname">ProducerDataStatus()</code> message, then began
sending buffers. Note that there is a distinction between the buffer's
receipt in <code class="methodname">BufferReceived()</code> and its eventual
handling in <code class="methodname">HandleEvent()</code>. Also note that given
our stated scheduling latency of 5000 microseconds, the first buffer was
sent too late for the <code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> to handle in a
timely manner—information to be communicated to whoever wrote this
particular <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> node!
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">LogWriter</code> class can easily be adapted to log other sorts of messages.
Just add your own custom message codes to the <span class="type">log_what</span> <code class="code">enum</code> in
<code class="filename">LogWriter.h</code>,
string translations for them to the <code class="function">log_what_to_string()</code>
function, and appropriate handling in <code class="methodname">LogWriter::HandleMessage()</code>. If you
need to pass custom information in the log message, add a new variant to
the union declared in the <span class="type">log_message</span> struct.
</p><p>
If you're developing <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> nodes, this class will help you
debug them. If you're developing <code class="classname">BBufferConsumers</code>, this node will show
you how to structure your code. And if you're just writing Media Kit
applications, this node gives you an easy way to tell whether you've set
up the rest of the node chain correctly. Any way you slice it,
<code class="classname">LoggingConsumer</code> is a must-have component in any Media Kit development
suite!

Good question. As the range of devices connectable to the Web keeps
growing, I'd like to offer Be's perspective on this increasingly hot
topic. Every week brings new market research showing how enormous this
category is anticipated to be—and such large numbers clearly assume
the bundling of all sorts of devices. Even if IP-enabled refrigerators
don't make a huge contribution to this new genre, the broad definition
has to cover many disparate devices: <acronym class="acronym">PDA</acronym>s, cellular phones, game
consoles, <acronym class="acronym">VCR</acronym>s, set-top boxes, WebTVs and similar devices, and the
multimedia Web appliances announced by companies such as MicroWorkz in
the US and contemplated by others in the US, Europe, and Japan.
</p><p>
Today I'll look at the multimedia Web appliance subcategory, and approach
it by turning the now well-understood WebTV experience inside out. By
this I mean that WebTV expects me to read my e-mail on the TV screen in
the privacy of the family room. Another view of the world is reading my
e-mail, or browsing eBay with two video windows on the screen, one with
CNN, muted, the other one with a view of my front door, while I listen to
MP3 music from the Web. Or any other such combination of unadulterated
Web content—as opposed to content remanufactured for the need of a
nonstandard rendering device such as a TV screen or the display on a Web
phone.
</p><p>
Not that "remanufacturing" Web content is such a bad thing; WebTV has
gained a loyal following, and Web-enabled phones and PDAs will be very
successful. In the case of portable devices, the trade-offs, the
additional complications of adapting Web content to "wearable" devices
(as Motorola likes to call them) are gladly accepted as the price to pay
for mobility.
</p><p>
The next question is whether or not the kind of Web appliance I just
described is a replacement for a PC. The answer is a clear "no." In my
mind they coexist, because they address different users and uses. The PC
is a protean device—its seemingly infinite variety of application
software enables it to assume an endless succession of shapes, from an
entertainment center to a software development workstation to an office
productivity toolkit. This is great as long as it's what the user is
looking for, although it poses equally infinite complications in the
layers of software silt inside the legacy operating systems and their
applications.
</p><p>
But if all you want is the infinity of one space—the Web—a
multimedia Web appliance might be your cup of computing. Why wait for a
PC to boot? With broadband connectivity, DSL or cable modems, you can
have the Web at your beck and call all the time, instantly, in the
kitchen, the family room, or on your night stand.
</p><p>
Lastly, multimedia. Just as the print medium embraced color—even the
venerable New York Times—the Web wants to create a multimedia
experience, whether to charm you into buying something or entertain you,
or to educate or inform you. I realize the word "hypermedia" has been so
abused that its coin has lost some relief, but the fact remains that the
BeOS offers a unique combination of smaller footprint, greater
robustness, and multiple media streams for the creation of a compelling
Web hypermedia experience. The very type of experience that defines our
view of an extremely promising segment of the Web appliance market.
