I get a lot of mail—work related, private mail, automated bug reports,
correspondence with old friends, and those unsolicited advertisements
that we all love so much. I separate work and private mail by using two
different accounts. At work, I use BeMail and break it down with queries
to break it down (usually the breakdown is between "Unread" and
everything else). I confess that at home I store my mail on my headless
Linux machine, filter it with procmail, and read it with mutt (via telnet
from my BeOS machine, of course). Why? Because I can connect to the
machine from anywhere on the planet (at least anywhere that I can use ssh
to get through Brian's gestapo firewall) and read my mail remotely.
</p><p>
All this is a result of the way that mail is usually handled. One of the
older mailbox protocols on the net is <acronym class="acronym">POP</acronym>, or Post Office Protocol. It's
simple and reliable, but it's really only designed to let you store mail
on a server temporarily, until you can download and read it. There is no
provision for storing messages on the server, much less sorting,
categorizing, or shuffling them.
</p><p>
Enter <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym>—the Internet Message Access Protocol. Designed and proposed
in late December of 1996, it provides an interface for remotely storing
and retrieving e-mail messages. However, since it's complicated compared
to <acronym class="acronym">POP</acronym>, it doesn't seem to be widely implemented. At least not on BeOS,
the only operating system that really matters in this context.
</p><p>
An Internet protocol is usually defined in a "Request for Comment," or
RFC. This document is a proposal by someone that explains the goals of
their protocol and methods for implementation. <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> version 4 is
documented in RFC 2060, available at
<a class="ulink" href="http://sunsite.auc.dk/RFC/rfc/rfc2060.html">http://sunsite.auc.dk/RFC/rfc/rfc2060.html</a>, and finer RFC mirrors
everywhere. It may help if you read along.
</p><p>
I started this project with the goal of creating a set of objects that I
could use to represent the bits of data and processes that need to be
shuffled around in order to deal with <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym>. I looked through the
specification to find the best way to break down the process into units
of information and the processes that can be done to them. After scanning
the RFC, I came up with the following group of objects. I'll list them in
simplest to most complex order, because many of them are defined in terms
of each other and I wish to avoid forward declarations.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id829236"></a>Flag</h3></div></div></div><p>
<acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> messages and mailboxes can have a set of flags associated with them.
These can be used both by the user and by the system. In addition, flags
can either be "permanent," in which case they'll be preserved from
session to session, or "temporary," in which case they'll only be valid
during the current session. Other than that, there isn't much to do with
a flag object, except own it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id829257"></a>Message</h3></div></div></div><p>
<acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> messages consist of an RFC-822 (you know where to look it up) or
MIME message, with an associated 32-bit unique identifier. The server
must be capable of providing several different representations of the
message. For now, this system just deals with the raw message. Somewhere
around here is a set of classes for parsing messages, but they don't
belong to me. I'll pressure the author or something.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id829278"></a>Mailbox</h3></div></div></div><p>
<acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> mailboxes contain lists of messages and a unique "validity ID" used
to avoid collisions. The server also provides a "Next UID" which can be
used by clients to create new messages. I simply use a <code class="classname">BList</code> to keep
track of the messages (or at least the Message IDs) in the mailbox. In
addition, mailboxes can be heirarchial—but I've chosen not to
implement this feature of <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> for the time being.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id829307"></a>Connection</h3></div></div></div><p>
This is where the magic happens. A Connection is responsible for
connecting to the server, logging in, handling the listing of mailboxes
and their messages, and eventually the downloading message bodies. It
needs to know information like the hostname, username, and password. It
also maintains lists of mailboxes, as well as an API for dealing with
them. This is the most complicated object, containing functions for
opening a network stream, composing requests, and parsing the results. It
also uses a <code class="classname">BList</code> of Mailbox objects to track the boxes for the current
session.
</p><p>
An <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> transaction consists of a request tagged with an ID, followed by
one or more reponses from the server, terminated with a final response
which is tagged with the original tag from the request. The tag can be
any set of alphabetic or numeric characters, and should be different for
every transaction. The <acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym>Connection class has a private function to
generate tags based on a counter, by appending the counter's value to the
word "KRIMEZ" (for historical reasons) and then incrementing the counter.
A typical transaction works like this:
</p><p>
Client sends a request tagged with a string: KRIMEZ3 LIST "" * Server
responds with an untagged response: * LIST (\NoInferiors) NIL INBOX
Server ends the transaction with the tagged response KRIMEZ3 OK LIST
completed
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">IMAP</acronym> servers are allowed to respond with any set of valid responses they
wish. This means that the parser must be able to deal with just about
anything, and figure out quite a bit based on its idea of the current
state of the connection. I've chosen to have a single function,
<code class="methodname">HandleResponse()</code>, called after every command is sent. The function reads
lines from the network stream and deals with them until it detects a
tagged response. Each line is identified and dealt with accordingly. Many
commands are simply ignored, as they require no acknowledgement and we
are not interested in them. Some commands contain information, which we
grab, parse, and store.
</p></div><p>
After that, this project is pretty much just a parser and a network
wrapper. I'm running out of space, so I'll hope that the code speaks for
itself. You'll find it at

Writing an add-on for the Translation Kit, like writing most software,
involves laying some groundwork before you get to the good stuff. For
that reason, I've written a framework into which you only need drop code
which is specific to the format you want to support. The rest is done for
you. Pick up the archive here:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/translation_kit /TranslatorTemplate.zip&gt;
</p><p>
If you're eager to get started, you can pretty much skip the rest of this
article. Just get the code, and search for !!!, which will indicate where
you need to make changes. Please note that the code as is will compile
and run, but not do anything useful, since the encoding and decoding
routines have been left blank (they're up to you).
</p><p>
For the purpose of illustration, I've picked an up and coming image
format, <acronym class="acronym" title="Multiple-image Network Graphics">MNG</acronym>.
This should not be construed as a hint that we're going to
support it.
</p><p>
The main steps you need to take are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Define some strings and constants, as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#define <code class="constant">NATIVE_TRANSLATOR_ACRONYM</code> "MNG"
#define <code class="constant">NATIVE_TRANSLATOR_FORMAT</code> 'MNG '
#define <code class="constant">NATIVE_TRANSLATOR_MIME_STRING</code> "image/mng"
#define <code class="constant">NATIVE_TRANSLATOR_DESCRIPTION</code> "MNG image"
#define <code class="constant">copyright_string</code> "© 1999 Be Incorporated"
</pre></li><li><p>
Add controls to the <code class="classname">TranslatorView</code> if you have any user selectable
options.
</p></li><li><p>
Modify the <code class="methodname">Identify()</code> function to recognize images in your format.
</p></li><li><p>
Write the encode and decode routines.
</p></li><li><p>
Rename the executable as appropriate (<span class="application">MNGTranslator</span>, for instance).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
That's all there is to it. A couple of things to note:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
As a good translator, this framework provides an app and a window
should the user run the add-on directly. This is not much extra work, but
is useful if there are options to set.
</p></li><li><p>
Translating from and to the same format is done using a dumb copy
between the input and output streams. This was the source of a bug in two
of the Be-supplied translators, and has been fixed.
</p></li><li><p>
Invoking this translator with a type constant of 0 will output a
<code class="constant">B_TRANSLATOR_BITMAP</code>, as explained in my previous article.
</p></li></ol></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee4-44"></a>More on <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym></h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Last week's column on peaceful coexistence brought more e-mail than I
expected. I thought the amusing situation I reported was just that, an
anecdote illustrating how well we managed to exist on the hard disks of
PC clones next to the Windows partition. Your Windows system refuses to
work, so boot BeOS and we might help you retrieve your data and/or edit
system files. The usual caveats are hereby stipulated, as counsel
recommends, and we have no plans at this time to start a Windows
utilities business.
</p><p>
After several readers and BeOS users reported similar experiences, I went
to the in-house gurus and asked why we succeeded where our worthy elders
failed. What seemed initially like a happy accident now looked like a
systematic feature our <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> file system extension; I wanted to know where
and why our implementation was superior.
</p><p>
Victor Tsou, the engineer who implemented this file system extension, put
it more modestly. He thought it might be imprudent to call our <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> module
"better." We certainly don't have (yet) the benefit of the same large
scale testing as the Windows <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> implementation does. Ours is a different
implementation. We use a different approach to achieve the same goal of
safely reading and writing <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> files. The tests we perform might exhibit
subtle differences here and there. As a result, in a small number of
cases, we might be able to read <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> files that Windows can't read.
Conversely, in a similarly small number of instances, Windows might be
able to read <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> files that BeOS can't read.
</p><p>
In other words, either system might fail to read .02 percent of <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym>
files, but not the same .02 percent. (I use .02 percent as a place
holder; the actual number is much smaller.) Statistically, Windows is
called upon to read and write <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> files much more often than BeOS. As a
result, Windows' "bad" .02 percent is more frequently seen than our own
"bad" .02 percent.
</p><p>
None of this diminishes the merit of our ability to coexist nicely with a
<acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym> file system. It's a very pleasant feature, one that I personally
enjoy greatly, but we don't need to harm a good piece of engineering by
exaggerating its reach. And while we're on the subject of reach and file
systems, our readers know that we support more than <acronym class="acronym">FAT</acronym>;
</p><p>
See
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.beatjapan.org/mirror/www.be.com/support/qandas/faqs/faq-0259.html">http://www.beatjapan.org/mirror/www.be.com/support/qandas/faqs/faq-0259.html</a> for more.
</p><p>
We might even claim to have both a very robust 64-bit journaling native
file system with BeFS and a very (the most?) extensive set of external
file system plug-ins. This is consistent with a philosophy we share with
many: facilitate the movement of data, avoid roach motels.
</p><p>
Lastly, a note I received from Russia, from Max Bazarov, a.k.a. Baza, as
he calls himself:
</p><p>
If you like Norton Commander...I think...final release of BeFar will be
interesting for you :)
</p><p>
http://www.beos.ru/projects/befar/<br />

</p><p>
gl, Max Bazarov ( Baza )<br />
BeNews.Ru Editor,<br />

baza@benews.ru
</p><p>
I used the URL and, yes indeed, a BeOS version of Norton Commander
appeared on my screen. Now I'm fond of Norton Commander. Not the least
reason for this affection concerns the time in 1995, when I upgraded my
home PC from Windows 3.11, the one that really worked, to Windows 95. I'd
heard all the stories about the end of the "Windows on top of DOS" era.
With 3.11, you booted DOS or, in my case, launched Norton Commander at
the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then, you could forage around, or type
WIN to launch Windows. With Windows 95, Microsoft declared this ancient
history, presenting Windows 95 as a totally integrated product.
</p><p>
So—I upgrade my system and, after a number of restarts, it reboots for
good and.... I see the familiar Norton Commander. I type <code class="command">WIN</code> and Windows
95 starts. I restart, same story. This time, I type <code class="command">VER</code>, for the DOS
version, and get a Version 7.0 reply. The upgrade process preserved my
<code class="filename">AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file, complete with NC as the last two (visible) characters.
This, in turn, exposed the Win 95 marketecture.
