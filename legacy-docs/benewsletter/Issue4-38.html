Most programs where speed counts have a "fast case" code path somewhere
in the code. This is a path which is optimized for a particular state of
the program. Examples of this would be an aligned memcpy or gourad
triangles in OpenGL. The developer has picked a state combination that he
thinks is important and has created either an optimized C or asm path for
that case. This often speeds up that case considerably. However, it has
some problems.
</p><p>
The big problem with using fast cases is that not all cases are fast. An
example of this would be setting any one of the color masks in GL to
false. This will cut performance by ~25%, because you now miss what the
designer considered a fast case and you hit the generic slow case. It's
not that this case need be any slower, but either that it wasn't
considered important or there wasn't time to write a fast case for it.
</p><p>
So, why not write fast cases for every path (or my path)? I often see the
question "Why isn't drawing with XYZ enabled faster?" To give you an idea
how many paths would have to be optimized just for triangle drawing,
here's a brief list of state that needs to be considered.
</p><pre class="screen">
State               Possible Settings
Color Masks                16
Depth Mask                  2
Depth Test                  2
Depth Function              8
Alpha Test                  2
Alpha Function              8
Stencil Test                2
Stencil Function            8
Stencil Pass Op             8
Stencil Fail Op             8
Total                 8388608 !!!!
</pre><p>
This table doesn't include texturing, stipple, fog, or blending, among
others. You can see how choosing five or six of the above combinations
can easily miss the needs of many applications.
</p><p>
Another solution is needed. One that works well is to dynamically
generate the fast path for a given case as needed. This gives much
greater flexibility in covering more cases and generally improving
performance, because you can literally have a separate code path for
every case.
</p><p>
Dynamic assembly is not the same as self-modifying code. It's much more
closely related to a JIT (just-in-time compiler) than self-modifying
code. With dynamic assembly, the code is not modified after it's created
until it is no longer needed. This avoids the big problem with
self-modifying code; that is, that most modern processors will at best
stall for a few hundred cycles, or at worst not maintain coherency
between the data and instruction caches. When the code is created we need
only update the processor state once for many thousands of uses.
</p><p>
The next problem that comes up is creating the asm code. Many of you are
probably wondering how to go about adding an assembler to your program.
The answer is that you don't really need to do so for most programs.
Let's take a simple case of a blitter.
</p><p>
We want the following abilities:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Source is 8-bit index or 32-bit RGBA.
</p></li><li><p>
Destination is 32-bit RGBA.
</p></li><li><p>
Support the eight standard alpha test functions.
</p></li><li><p>
Support replace and xor write modes.
</p></li></ul><p>
From the above list you get 2*8*2 paths. With 32 code paths it might be
practical to implement every case by hand, but it would quickly get out
of control if you added more destination or source types, or any other
features.
</p><p>
To implement this the problem can be broken into these components, or
steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Some function initialization.
</p></li><li><p>
Loop initialization.
</p></li><li><p>
Loading of the source.
</p></li><li><p>
Alpha test.
</p></li><li><p>
Write destination.
</p></li><li><p>
Continue loop.
</p></li><li><p>
Clean up and return.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Here is some sample code for each component (x86):
</p><pre class="programlisting asm">
Initialization
    Push edi
    Push esi
    Mov edi, [esp+12]   ; Destination
    Mov esi, [esp+ 16]  ; Source
    Mov ecx, [esp+ 20]  ; Count


Load source index
    Movzx  edx, byte [esi]
    Mov edx, [theTable + edx]


Load source RGBA
    Mov edx, [esi]


Alpha test
    Mov eax, edx
    Shr eax, 24
    Cmp eax, [alphaRefrence]
    ## Jcc toContinueLoop


Write destination
    Mov [edi], edx


Continue loop
    Dec ecx
    ## Jnz toLoop


Cleanup and Return
    Pop esi
    Pop edi
    Ret
</pre><p>
Once you have the above parts ready (probably in an assembly file of
components) you can assemble them to make a function. The easiest way to
do this (on x86) is simply to allocate some memory large enough to hold
the largest case and copy the pieces into place from your parts file to
the memory allocation. Here's the example for color index and alpha
function of write on not equal:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Allocate memory for function.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy initialization code.
</p></li><li><p>
Note the current index into the allocation for loop fix up later.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy source index loader.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy alpha test code.
</p></li><li><p>
Make space for conditional jump and note the location.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy destination writer code.
</p></li><li><p>
Fix up alpha test conditional jump. The function is not equal so we
choose JE as our conditional test and insert it at the address noted
from step 6 above to jump to the current location.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy continue loop code.
</p></li><li><p>
Fix up loop jump. We need a JNZ to jump from the current address
to the address noted in step 3 above.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy clean up and return code.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
After following these steps you should have a blitter fully optimized for
all the above cases. The trickiest part of dynamic assembly is carefully
choosing the register allocation, since all your components are
constrained by the choices you make. The other difficulty is dealing with
all the conditional jumps. Because they are relative, the offsets need to
be calculated at assembly time, unless the jump and its destination are
contained within one code component. Calls are also relative and need a
similar fix up if used.
</p><p>
I hope this will help you to write code that is very fast and covers all
the needed cases. Please note that while this example is for x86, the
techniques should also work well on other processors. Thanks for reading.

Keyboards, Too</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Steven</span> <span class="surname">Black</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Greetings one and all, whether you read my articles or ignore them! Today
I'll talk about two new and different items. One's a little script which
provides an unsupported keymap-independent solution for 104-key
keyboards. The other is a generic input filter that enhances the Input
Recorder.
</p><p>
First, my 104-key keyboard solution. Because we need access to the
Option

<sup>[<a id="id820902" href="#ftn.id820902" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>

key in BeOS, and 101-key keyboards lack an
equivalent key, we've made the right <span class="keysym">Control</span> key behave like an <span class="keysym">Option</span>
key by default. While most people don't notice this as a problem, if you
have a 104-key keyboard and habitually use your right <span class="keysym">Control</span> key, it's
inconvenient.
</p><p>
We have a "keymap" command line program which allows users to modify
their own keymaps. Although it's fairly straight- forward, I wouldn't
call it the easiest thing for a novice to use.
</p><p>
There was an item on BeWare which remapped the right <span class="keysym">Control</span> and <span class="keysym">Option</span>
keys to be as labeled, but it mysteriously disappeared. I hadn't noticed
its disappearance until I recommended it to someone. When I realized it
was gone, I whipped up this script, as I felt bad about recommending
something that didn't exist:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/util/104-keymap-script.zip&gt;
</p><p>
This script reads in your current keymap, adjusts it slightly, and writes
it out to a file in your home directory. (It auto- matically loads the
modified keymap, but doesn't automatically overwrite the file in your
home directory.) There are command line options to alter both of these
behaviors. Check out  --help  for details.
</p><p>
The script does a read-modify-write, with your current keymap. The only
changes are to the right <span class="keysym">Option</span> and right <span class="keysym">Control</span> keys, and only if your
current keymap has those two keys mapped to their defaults. (For example,
if you're using a custom keymap with the right <span class="keysym">Control</span> behaving like
number lock, it won't touch that key.)
</p><p>
And now for Part II of my article. This is an input filter which sends an
application-defined message to an application, based upon a hot key
combination.
</p><p>
While there are already applications which launch programs via key
combinations, there is currently no generic solution for simply sending
messages to applications. Because I wanted this for the Input Recorder, I
decided to take the friendlier approach and whip up a generic solution
for the problem.
</p><p>
The latest InputRecorder zip file has a WarmKeysFilter. The install
script now also installs this:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/input server/InputRecorder.zip&gt;
</p><p>
As you'll see if you look at the source, the Input Recorder sends a
message to the filter, informing it of the requested hot key information.
One new, interesting use for this is that it lets you start and stop
recording—even if the InputRecorder window is minimized or on a
different workspace.
</p><p>
The Input Recorder uses the WarmKeys filter to enable the user to press
Play—(<span class="keysym">Modifier</span>+<span class="keycap">P</span>),
stop, (<span class="keysym">Modifier</span>+<span class="keycap">S</span>)—or Record --
(<span class="keysym">Modifier</span>+<span class="keycap">R</span>) --
when the application is not active or minimized. The Input Recorder
filter was modified to pass through the WarmKeys messages, so you can
press <span class="keysym">Modifier</span>+<span class="keycap">S</span>
to stop, even when input is locked out. For the
modifier, it uses the <span class="keysym">Menu</span> key on x86 systems keyboards, and the right
<span class="keysym">Control</span> on PPC systems.
</p><p>
If you change which modifier key is used by WarmKeys, (for example, you
want to use the menu key on your BeBox, or use a 101-key keyboard on your
x86 machine) you'll also want to make a change in Input Recorder filter,
so that it can't lock out the WarmKeys messages.
</p><p>
If there were a way to make the WarmKeys filter always get the keyboard
event before the InputRecorder filter, it would always catch and process
hot keys, and the InputFilter wouldn't need to know anything about
passing through hot key events. However, this would also prevent the
InputRecorder from recording hot key events.
</p><p>
Currently, there is no logic in the WarmKeys filter. The InputRecorder
requests its three keys; if someone already has events attached to those
keys, the request fails. While the InputRecorder could get a message
informing it of the status of the request, there is no logic in place in
the InputRecorder to deal with this.
</p><p>
Clearly, randomly requesting keys won't work in the long term. Some sort
of method is required that allows the user to assign which keys do what
when dealing with more applications.
</p><p>
In the WarmKeys filter, I've included ways to check to see who is
receiving events from keys. There are also ways to verify that your hot
keys were given to you properly.
</p><p>
However, I do see this as an excellent third-party opportunity. There's
already at least one hot key enabling technology available on BeWare,
although at the time I'm writing this, there's no solution which allows
you to send application-defined messages.
</p><p>
The little filter does everything that I wanted done superbly. The Input
Recorder is most grateful for this evolutionary leap in its development.

Welcome to Part I of a two-part look at the Translation Kit, a subject
near and dear to my heart. In this installment, I'll look at a common
task: how to modify a file panel in order to save an image in any
available format.
</p><p>
I hear someone in the crowd yell, "But that's simple! Just subclass
<code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>, and then start adding some controls to the window, and... uh,
wait a second. What do you mean <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> isn't a descendant of
<code class="classname">BWindow</code>?" And so the matter of message handling comes up, as does font
sensitivity, and with a few other gotchas along the way, you suddenly
have a newsletter article worth reading again. So grab the code, and
let's get to it! If the code is not there yet, it will be soon.
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/translation_kit/TranslatorPanel.zip&gt;
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> is a strange beast. Its headers live in the Storage Kit, but
you have to link against <code class="filename">libtracker.so</code>. It also doesn't inherit from
anything, it simply owns a window. The primary problem this poses is that
when you add your own controls, you don't have a <code class="classname">BHandler</code> around to
receive their messages. You could add all your controls to a view (which
is a <code class="classname">BHandler</code>), but that would require them to be adjacent in a way that
they all fit into that parent view. You could also handle the messages in
the application's looper (where a <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>'s messages go by default),
but then your code is spread all over, and you don't have access to
private members of your file panel.
</p><p>
The solution I've chosen (which is not the only one) is to build the save
dialog by subclassing both <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> and <code class="classname">BHandler</code>. This provides a
<code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code> hook where it's most needed, and allows me to place
controls anywhere in the window. Of course, handlers need to be attached
to loopers, and conveniently the file panel's window fits the bill. To
set this up, do:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">TranslatorSavePanel</code>::<code class="methodname">TranslatorSavePanel</code>() : <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>(),
    <code class="classname">BHandler</code>() {

    <code class="methodname">Window</code>()-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddHandler</code>(<code class="varname">this</code>);
}
</pre><p>
Look at the source to see all the arguments and gory details. The one
important thing to do before you start adding controls is to move the
existing ones out of the way. The Be Book documents the names of all the
standard parts of a file panel, so you can <code class="methodname">FindView()</code>
and then <code class="methodname">MoveBy()</code>
as appropriate. When you add your own controls, make sure they're
positioned relative to the existing pieces:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// Build the "Settings" button relative to the cancel button</span>

</pre><p>
Now to add a list of all the available translators. Some people like to
add this to the menu bar on top; personally, I like to add a <code class="classname">BMenuField</code>
above the file name. One way to do this is to subclass <code class="classname">BMenuItem</code> and add
a translator id variable. This allows the desired output format to be
queried by finding the currently marked menu item. When the user chooses
to save a file, this id is included in the file panel's message, and is
passed to <code class="methodname">Translate()</code> to complete the request. Building the menu looks
like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">TranslatorSavePanel</code>::<code class="methodname">BuildMenu</code>() {

Make sure you don't delete the default translator roster—you're just

The settings button tries to build a configuration view for the selected
translator. It passes a pointer to a <code class="code">BRect(0, 0, 239, 239)</code> to
<code class="methodname">BTranslatorRoster::MakeConfigurationView()</code> in case the translator doesn't
set the size of the rect itself. It then builds a window according to
this rect, and ensures that the view is the right size and in the right
place. The layout and sizing of this view has been standardized for the
next BeOS release—I'll go into details of that in my next article.

The rest of the app is fairly simple: it draws a bitmap if there is one,
or "Drop an image here" if there isn't. It also handles loading and
saving of images. Loading an image is as simple as grabbing an entry ref
from a message:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">entry_ref</span> <code class="varname">ref</code>;
if (<code class="varname">message</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindRef</code>("refs", &amp;<code class="varname">ref</code>) != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) return;
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">entry</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">ref</code>);
<code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">entry</code>);
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code> *</span><code class="varname">new_bitmap</code> =
    <code class="classname">BTranslationUtils</code>::<code class="methodname">GetBitmapFile</code>(<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Path</code>());
</pre><p>
Saving is also pretty easy, with only one catch. After recovering your
information from the message, and creating a <code class="classname">BFile</code>, watch out for
<code class="classname">BBitmapStream</code> taking your bitmap down with it:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BTranslatorRoster</code> *</span><code class="varname">roster</code> = <code class="classname">BTranslatorRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">Default</code>();
<code class="classname">BBitmapStream</code> <code class="varname">stream</code>(<code class="varname">bitmap</code>);
<span class="comment">// If the id is no longer valid or the translator fails
// for any other reason, catch it here</span>
if(<code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Translate</code>(<code class="varname">id</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">stream</code>, <code class="constant">NULL</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">file</code>, 0) != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">BAlert</code> *</span><code class="varname">alert</code> = new <code class="classname">BAlert</code>(<code class="constant">NULL</code>,
        "Could not save the image.", "OK");
    <code class="varname">alert</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Go</code>();
}
<span class="comment">// Reclaim the ownership of the bitmap, otherwise it would
// be deleted when stream passes out of scope</span>
<code class="varname">stream</code>.<code class="methodname">DetachBitmap</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">bitmap</code>);
</pre><p>
Stay tuned for Part II of our examination of the Translation Kit: a
prefabricated translator add-on for reading and writing images.

As the title of today's column does not suggest, my topic is Life After
the PC. As for the title itself, I'll attempt to connect it to the topic
without too many unseemly contortions or painful puns.
</p><p>
First of all, Life After the PC is a misnomer. PCs will be with us for a
long time. We've progressed from the first crawling instances of the
species in 1967, to the affordable microprocessors that started the
current explosion in the late 70s, to the personal supercomputers of
today (to quote a captain of our industry). Prospects for their
continuing evolution are good: faster better cheaper processors and
memories, I/O, displays, networks...
</p><p>
So, why even mention Life After the PC if so many refinements are at
hand? Because PCs are becoming "free." Though as with cell phones, "free"
actually means a different form of payment. That is, you commit to use a
service, wireless telephony or Internet access, for a number of months,
and you get a free phone or a free PC. Good services and good devices,
where "free" amounts to a form of loan and risk-taking by the service
provider. For PCs to achieve that status means we're now in a mature,
commoditized market. One might joke that the girth of Office 2000 running
on Windows 2000 requires a 600 Mhz Pentium III, but many consumers have
figured out that a competent 366 Mhz Celeron PC, minus the Compuserve
rebate, is "free" and perfectly capable of running Windows applications.
</p><p>
Note the last part of the sentence, Windows applications. Once upon a
time, there was an appliance called a Word Processor. That's all it did
and, for a while it processed words better than PCs running clunky
imitation word processing software. But it died because PCs gave off this
wonderful whiff of infinity. Customers perceived the infinite potential
for PCs to run all kinds of software. Some useful, some not, some
utilitarian, some fun, some reliable, some awful. But the abundance, the
fun, the dream won over the seriousness, the finite fitness-to-purpose of
word processing appliances.
</p><p>
So, if PCs are a) "free" and b) "infinite," how come we're so
enthusiastic about the future of Web appliances? The answer lies in
another infinity. Just as PCs are surrounded by myriads of applications,
the Web offers another kind of infinity of content—information,
entertainment, services, even applications available from servers
somewhere in the clouds. Some believe that PCs will absorb this new Web
dimension and offer both infinities rolled into one. This is the
philosophy behind Microsoft's unified user interface for the desktop and
the Net, with everything represented as a Web page. It was an interesting
experiment. And, yes, one can hope PCs will become simpler, shedding
costly, clunky, vestigial organs such as serial, parallel, and keyboard
ports and the ISA bus. It might happen—the irresistible drive to offer
add-ons, graphics and sound cards, new-fangled DVD-ROM or CR-RW units
might subside—but when? In other words, some think PCs will be
simultaneously even more protean and even simpler than they are today.
Procrustean might be a better word.
</p><p>
I believe that discussing PCs and Web appliances in an either/or manner
isn't helpful. We want both. Knowledgeable PC users know what PCs do
well; where they're too complex and cumbersome, users will want both PCs
and Internet appliances. Normal human beings who've stayed away from PCs
because of their perceived Swiss Army knife complexity will be happy to
have devices dedicated to one task. They'll appreciate drilling the Web
and enjoying one kind of infinity without being encumbered by the other,
or being constricted by the finite range of the older style appliances.
</p><p>
Which points to the need for a better word than "appliance" for the new
genre we're discussing. Here in the land of neologism—and Silicon
Valley is the capital of buzzwords—I know this immigrant is about to
learn a new noun. "Wa" would be nice—sounds Japanese and actually
means something like harmony. In any case, we need something short and
crisp, like PIM, PDA, or NC. Suggestions?

The key I refer to as the <span class="keysym">Option</span> Key, is only labeled "Option" on
Mac-style keyboards. On 104-key keyboards, it often sports the logo of an
alternate operating system (e.g., a "Window"). It's in the same location
on all keyboards, between the <span class="keysym">Alt</span>/<span class="keysym">Command</span>
key and the <span class="keysym">Control</span> key. I
refer to it as the <span class="keysym">Option</span> key, because in BeOS its identifier is named
<code class="constant">B_OPTION_KEY</code>.
