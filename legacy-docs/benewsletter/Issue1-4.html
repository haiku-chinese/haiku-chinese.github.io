This past summer, my wife and I went on a wonderful vacation to Prince
Edward Island. We toured the island on our tandem bicycle. It was
fabulous—country roads, little traffic, and wonderful people. Cycling
is a great way to travel, and it is even better on a tandem. Two people
on one bike are faster than those same two people on two bikes, and the
back rider can actually spend the afternoon enjoying the sights.
</p><p>
What does this have to do with Be and the BeBox? Maybe nothing, I just
wanted to reminisce about summer. But if you think about it, a two-person
bike, a two-CPU machine—they must have something in common. So
actually there is some sense to this column.
</p><p>
While I wouldn't claim that programming a BeBox is as easy as riding a
bike, I would like to make an analogy to riding a tandem. If you already
know how to ride a bike, riding a tandem is really very simple—once
you and your partner learn a few rules. Who balances the bike at stops,
and does the bike lean to the left or right? What are the signals to
start coasting or to resume pedaling? Who gets on and off the bike first
and how do you spin the pedals into position when you mount the bike,
without whacking your partner in the shins? Those are basically all the
rules of the road. Enjoy the ride.
</p><p>
If you have any sort of programming experience, then we hope you'll find
programming the BeBox a breeze, just like moving from a single bike to a
tandem. And like riding a tandem, there are just a few new rules to learn
in order to protect your shins. Interestingly enough, these rules
partially stem from the fact that, like a tandem, the BeBox has two
engines (CPUs) instead of one.
</p><p>
For some, perhaps many, the BeBox will be their first experience
programming on a true preemptive, multithreaded, multiprocessing machine.
Not only is the Be operating system multithreaded, but the system itself
makes significant use of this functionality. As described in an earlier
column ("<a class="xref" href="Issue1-2.html#Engineering1-2" title="Be Engineering Insights: Programming Should Be Fun">Be Engineering Insights: Programming Should Be Fun</a>,"),
in the Be operating system each window has its own client-side
thread. In addition, every application has a dedicated thread, called the
main thread. In many other desktop systems, applications typically
consist of a single thread of execution. On the BeBox, applications are
inherently multithreaded, simply by virtue of putting up a few windows.
This is an important distinction and I would like to discuss two
important consequences of this design.
</p><p>
The first concept is that each thread runs asynchronously, and thus can
change its associated state and data at any time. The implication of this
fact is that code must be designed to avoid using inconsistent or garbage
data. For example, suppose the application's main thread has a pointer to
a window, and it wants to get some information out of that window.
Perhaps the window just decided to close, leaving the application with a
garbage pointer, or perhaps the window is in the middle of changing its
state so the data is inconsistent. Trying haphazardly to access this
window can lead to undefined results.
</p><p>
The programmer has several options to handle this situation. One solution
is to prevent the user from closing the window, and have all its state
changes controlled by the main thread. In this case the main thread
itself controls what that window can do, so it can safely access the
necessary data. Another option is to use the messaging system. The main
thread can post a message to the window requesting information. When the
window receives that message, it can ensure that it's in a consistent
state and return the desired information. The message-passing framework
on the BeBox is multithread safe—the system handles all the tricky
cases, such as the window disappearing in the middle of a "post." The
final option is to "lock" the window before directly accessing any data.
This locking ensures that the window still exists (that is, the window
hasn't closed), and that the window's thread won't execute any code until
the window is unlocked. The idea is that given a pointer to a window, the
Lock method will either successfully lock the window or gracefully fail,
if the window no longer exists. Without this ability, one thread could
not safely access data controlled by another thread. This locking is
implemented using a semaphore. There's a section about semaphores in the
"OS Kit" chapter of The Be Book. You can also learn more about semaphores
in almost any OS text book.
</p><p>
That gives you three different methods to access data safely, and there
are probably more. The method to use depends on the situation. The
important thing is to understand and think about these issues.
</p><p>
Be Commandment #1: Thou shalt not covet another thread's state or data
without taking proper precautions.
</p><p>
This brings us to the second and final concept—avoiding deadlocks.
Once this is understood, programming the BeBox can be as fun and simple
as riding a tandem. When a program starts locking objects to access data
safely, deadlocks become a possibility. There has been lots of research
on deadlocks, why they occur, how to avoid them, and how to detect them
—just take a look at any OS book. But understanding theory is often
quite a bit easier than putting that knowledge into practice. Yep, I've
programmed myself into a lot of deadlocks.
</p><p>
How can you avoid deadlocks? One good way is to minimize the amount of
locking. Always ask yourself if there is a better way to structure the
code to eliminate the need for locking. Structuring code to use messages
is one alternative to locking. A couple of things to remember are that
deadlocks can only occur if a thread holds two or more locks at a time,
and that in the Be operating system, whenever code is running in a window
thread, the window object is locked by that thread. This implies that
whenever a window thread locks another object, it's holding at least two
locks, opening the door for a deadlock. For example, suppose two windows,
A and B, want to share some information. If each window thread tries to
lock the other window in order to access the information, there is the
distinct possibility of hitting a deadlock.
</p><p>
In this example the thread for window A first locks window A (this
locking is implicit, as described above), and then tries to lock window
B. The thread for window B locks the objects in the reverse order. The
same two objects are being locked in two different orders, possibly
resulting in a deadlock, with A waiting to lock B, but B is already
locked, and itself waiting to lock A.
</p><p>
Be Commandment #2: Thou shalt not lock the same objects in differing
orders.
</p><p>
One solution to this problem is to restructure the code, so that if
multiple locks are needed to access the information, those locks will be
locked in the same order by both windows. This eliminates the chance of a
deadlock. One possibility might be to move the information associated
with each window outside the context of the window, and under the control
of a separate lock—let's call those locks X and Y. If both windows try
to acquire the locks in the same order, say X first and then Y, a
deadlock can't occur. When one of the windows owns lock X, the other
window would block trying to acquire that lock. The window that owns X
then acquires lock Y, and when that window finishes it releases both
locks. This frees up the other window, allowing it to proceed. There's no
longer the possibility of a deadlock. The key is acquiring the locks in a
consistent order.
</p><p>
That's all there is to safe multithreaded code. In simple Be
applications, the above issues usually don't come into play. For example,
in a single windowed application you normally don't need to worry about
locking and deadlocks. Programming the BeBox is as straightforward as
riding a bike. If you can understand and apply the two issues discussed
above, then building the most sophisticated application is only slightly
more involved—just like riding a tandem.

If you look at a number of Be developers, certain patterns begin to
emerge. Many are simply fed up with the existing platforms and they're
looking for a better alternative. They're less concerned with
opportunities to push into high-volume markets, like Windows, the
Macintosh, or UNIX, and they're more concerned with creating the best
possible applications for the most advanced technology.
</p><p>
Rafael Denoyo of Salem, Oregon, is a good example. His Dynamic
Predictions, Inc. makes software that specializes in numerical analysis.
The nine-person company produces custom programs for financial firms and
banks that deal with large numbers in analyzing market and financial
trends. Denoyo has worked with all of the popular platforms—from
Windows NT to Solaris. And he's had it.
</p><p>
"It's never been difficult to go from one platform to the other," he
says. "But I'm not satisfied with any of them. With Windows NT, I'm not
satisfied with either the OS or the API. I don't like Solaris either."
</p><p>
While NT has a lot of good features, Denoyo says, it's too bogged down
with "legacy code...There's too much it has to be compatible with." He
appreciates Be's decision to simply build the best possible computer and
operating system, without getting weighed down with past compatibility
issues. Denoyo says he liked NEXTSTEP, even though the hardware was
expensive. But just a few weeks after Steve Jobs assured him that NeXT
would stay in the hardware business, Jobs abandoned the NextStations.
NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors is a good operating system, he says, but
"it's fizzled and nobody is using it. It's good technology, but there's
no reason to get hitched to a stalled wagon." But even after getting
burned on NEXTSTEP, Denoyo is willing to take a chance on Be. I think
it's a better architecture," he says. "There's more power for the money."
</p><p>
Denoyo describes himself as a "classic early adopter." "Be is on the
upward curve," he says. "It has a lot of momentum and I like to get in on
things at the very beginning." Denoyo has ordered eight BeBoxes, and he's
excited about the prospect of a new platform.

Five years ago, we started with three basic ideas: Building a hardened
architectural advantage against legacy systems, helping software
developers change the economics of their business, and choosing the kind
of customers we had to please in order to gain a foothold in the
marketplace and to detect the new mother lode of innovative applications.
So far, time and changes in the marketplace have been kind to these three
ideas. In particular, the legacy systems we know and love are getting
richer, but also slower, fatter, more complex, and more fragile, thus
making a good case for a fresh start in markets and applications outside
of the office automation domain. We are also helped by developments we
did not foresee: The PCI bus took off, thus strengthening our commitment
to the PC clone organ bank, and the Internet, 25 years in the making,
finally gained wide currency, offering an ideal vehicle for Be and our
developers.
</p><p>
I don't want to represent that everything went according to plan. Ours
was not a straightforward path, ahead of schedule and under budget. We
experienced a number of difficulties and setbacks along the way,
euphemistically called "learning experiences." One such situation
deserves the term particularly well. We started with the belief we could
put different processors under the same yoke, on the same motherboard. We
don't feel that way anymore. Here's why.
</p><p>
In the beginning, we saw DSPs as a way of offering gobs of inexpensive
computing power. Our first motherboard sported two RISC microprocessors
and three DSPs, all 32-bit, all five from the same vendor. One DSP
supported voice, fax, and data communications, the next one sound, the
last one video. Software implementation of such functions promised great
flexibility: Upgrades would be easy and DSPs could be "borrowed" for
other uses requiring their computing power, such as mathematical
computations or graphics. At about $30 per DSP, these were inexpensive
MIPS. The real price was elsewhere.
</p><p>
First, DSPs are very difficult to program. They are much more finicky
than conventional microprocessors and only achieve their rated
performance if special care is taken in structuring the sequence of
operations they're asked to perform. Otherwise, contention for internal
resources causes visible performance degradation. Hand tuning of code is
often required and programming tools are much less sophisticated than
those found on conventional microprocessors.
</p><p>
Then, some kind of operating system is required to babysit the DSP or
DSPs, to schedule tasks, manage resources, and communicate with the rest
of the system, and the other processors. This gets very complicated.
People developing the system now have to contend with two programming
models and two pieces of system software and the coordination headaches
between them.
</p><p>
Lastly, there are the challenges of working with the maker of the DSPs
who also supplied the necessary system software, which had to be ported
to our system. This results in the usual technical and cultural
difficulties, regardless of the skill and goodwill deployed by both
sides. Changes on one side caused major headaches for the other,
communication problems, and delays. We were, in fact, developing not one
but two operating systems.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the PowerPC appeared on the scene about two years after we
started Be. Two factors drew us to it. One was the raw power its
architecture delivered, especially for us, free from emulation
requirements. The other attraction was its ability to perform high-speed
signal-processing tasks, thanks to a clever implementation of specific
floating-point instructions.
</p><p>
Suddenly, we have the native signal processing power we need and we make
everyone's life (including application developers) much simpler and
safer. And, as demand for more media processing arises—and we know it
will—we can add more processors without disturbing the applications or
their authors.
</p><p>
We quickly reached the decision to port our operating system to the
PowerPC. As an added benefit, we proved to ourselves the system was
indeed portable, none of the applications were affected, and we fixed a
few low-level problems that the process uncovered.
</p><p>
We were not alone in trying to glue DSPs onto motherboards. So far, none
of these attempts have been successful. Apple tried AT&amp;T DSPs with the AV
Quadras, NeXT made an earlier attempt with a Motorola signal processing
engine and, in the PC clone world, ACER went a similar route, with the
same results.
</p><p>
This is not to say DSPs are not successful in the PC world. For instance,
every modem is built around a DSP today. But the big difference is that
the application programmer doesn't have to know about it. The DSP is so
embedded, so hidden, it only manifests itself as an AT command set. It's
cheap, invisible, and doesn't create system software headaches.
</p><p>
Now we're witnessing the reappearance of DSPs on PC motherboards. Only
they're called multimedia chips this time and, yes, they handle sound,
video, voice, fax, and data communications. This is a trend Intel is
watching very intently as it could steal motherboard income from them.
Time will tell how these new entrants deal with system software
heterogeneities. My guess is the less visible to the programmer, the more
likely they are to find acceptance.
</p><p>
The current claims of being all-singing, all-dancing, multimedia engines
might make the desirable transparency an elusive goal.
