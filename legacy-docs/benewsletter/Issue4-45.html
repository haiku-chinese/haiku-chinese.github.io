Buried deep at the very heart of BeOS is a silent agent that rules the
traffic inside the computer: the scheduler. The scheduler's job is
basically to choose which thread will now run, and this happens whenever
some special events trigger. The scheduler is one of the components that
enable preemptive multitasking.

The technique described in this article is an unconventional way of
programming (in other words, a hack). While it is believed to be
reasonably safe, it has a number of side effects. Using it might make the
system behave oddly, and/or exhibit problems in programs that otherwise
seemed to work.
</p></div></div></div><div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">Warning</div><div class="graphic"><img class="icon" alt="Warning" width="32" src="images/admonitions/Stop_32.png" /><div class="text"><p>
This article only deals with the case of a single CPU system. The
behaviour of a multi-CPU system is somewhat more complex and is beyond
the scope of this article
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id829997"></a>When Is the Scheduler Invoked?</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are different events that can cause the scheduler to trigger:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Blocking calls: any function that a thread can call to make its state
switch from <code class="constant">B_THREAD_RUNNING</code> to one of <code class="constant">B_THREAD_SUSPENDED</code>,
<code class="constant">B_THREAD_WAITING</code>, <code class="constant">B_THREAD_RECEIVING</code>
and <code class="constant">B_THREAD_ASLEEP</code>. Those functions
obviously include <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code>, <code class="function">receive_data()</code>,
and <code class="function">snooze()</code>, as well
as <code class="function">suspend_thread()</code> when a thread calls it with its own thread id.
There are also many indirect cases that can cause a thread to block;
those cases include kernel calls to <code class="function">wait_for_thread()</code>, <code class="function">read_port()</code> and
<code class="function">write_port()</code>. Be aware too that the BeOS virtual memory subsystem is
protected by semaphores, which means that almost any instruction can
cause a thread to block (e.g., when handling a page fault, when
checking parameters for a kernel call, when dealing with areas...)
</p></li><li><p>
Synchronous preemption: any function that causes a thread that was
blocked to become ready again will also invoke the scheduler. Those
functions include <code class="function">resume_thread()</code>, <code class="function">kill_thread()</code>,
<code class="function">release_sem()</code>, <code class="function">delete_sem()</code>,
<code class="function">send_data()</code>, the death of a thread, and lots of others. There
are also many indirect cases that can cause a synchronous preemption,
including calls to <code class="function">read_port()</code> and <code class="function">write_port()</code>, and any case where a
thread exits the virtual memory subsystem.
</p></li><li><p>
Asynchronous preemption: whenever a piece of hardware requires some
attention from a CPU, it triggers an interrupt which causes the CPU to
suddenly jump to another piece of code (called an interrupt handler).
I'm not going to get into the details of programming an interrupt
handler, but it's important to know that every interrupt handler has a
chance to invoke the scheduler. One special kind of interrupt is very
important: the timer interrupt. The CPU can use it to be warned after a
given amount of time has elapsed. When that happens, the interrupt
handler for the timer invokes the scheduler (that's actually all it
does). That's the way you create preemptive multitasking. The scheduler
uses the timer to be warned when a snooze() (or any other blocking call
that has a timeout) expires, and to make sure that it gets invoked on a
regular basis. On BeOS R4.5.x, the scheduler is guaranteed to run at
least once every 3 ms. This amount of time is called the scheduler
quantum.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830114"></a>How Does the Scheduler Choose Which Thread Is Going to Run?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Each time the scheduler is invoked, it chooses which is the next thread
that's going to run. The scheduler can (obviously) only pick a thread
that's ready to run. The scheduler uses an algorithm to pick that thread,
depending on the priorities of all the threads that are ready to run.
That algorithm is quite simple (and mostly explained in the Be Book):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If a real-time thread (i.e., a thread with a priority greater than
100) is ready to run, this thread is automatically scheduled. If there
are several such threads, the one with the highest priority is
scheduled.
</p></li><li><p>
If there is no real-time thread ready to run, the scheduler chooses a
time-sharing thread (i.e., a thread with a priority between 1 and 99).
The likeliness that such a thread be scheduled increases with a factor
of two for such unit of priority.
</p></li><li><p>
The kernel keeps some special threads around, called idle threads,
that are scheduled whenever no other thread is ready. Since those idle
thread never block, the scheduler is guaranteed to always be able to
schedule a thread.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830162"></a>What About Full-Screen Games Running at 60 fps?</h3></div></div></div><p>
First, why would someone ask this question? Let's look at the way a game
typically works:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
get input from the user
</p></li><li><p>
render a new image
</p></li><li><p>
wait until the vertical retrace and display the newly computed image
</p></li><li><p>
loop
</p></li></ul><p>
and it's usually quite tricky (if not impossible) to know anything that's
going to happen in the future.
</p><p>
Let's imagine that the game is single-threaded, running on a single-CPU
system, at priority 20, and never blocks. The duration of a frame is 16.6
ms, which is approximately 5.5 scheduler quanta. Assuming nothing else
happens, the system will (on average) reschedule five times in the middle
of each frame. Let's now assume that another thread is running at
priority 10, and that this thread never blocks either.
</p><p>
The difference between the priorities in 10, thus the "other" thread will
be scheduled (on average) once every 1025 times, and will consume (on
average) 0.1% of the CPU time. I see you think "Why do I care about
0.1%?". You care about 0.1%, because the scheduler will not spread the
0.1%s evenly across all the frames. This will occur (on average) once
every 205 frames, which means that, once every 3 or 4 seconds, the game
will only have 80% of the CPU power available. This sudden loss of 20% of
the CPU power can be enough to make the game glitch.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830218"></a>So, What's the Fix?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let's now imagine that we have the same game running at priority 20, and
the annoying thread running at priority 10, but let's also imagine that
the scheduler triggers every 100 us (microseconds). The scheduler will
trigger on average 166 times per frame. The law of probabilities tell us
that 85% of the time, the annoying thread never gets schedules during a
frame. It gets scheduled once for 13.8% of the frames, twice for 1.1% of
the frames, three times for 0.06% of the frames, and so on.
</p><p>
Overall, it means that the annoying thread will use 1/166 of the time in
13.8% of the frames, 2/166 of the time in 1.1% of the frames, and so on,
which creates a total of (on average) the same 0.1% as we had before. So
what changed? Well, probabilities tell us that the annoying thread will
take less than 2% of the CPU time in more than 99.998% of the frames.
</p><p>
Wow, that's great, so why doesn't BeOS automatically reschedule every 100
us? Well, BeOS is optimized for multithreading, and rescheduling does not
cost that much, but it doesn't come for free either. Rescheduling every
100 us costs several percent of the CPU power on a PII-350.
</p><p>
So, what's the point of talking about something that doesn't exist? If we
look at the way the scheduler works, there's a way to trigger it a lot
more often. If a real-time thread does something like <code class="code">while (1) {
snooze(100); }</code>, this thread will call snooze, which will invoke the
scheduler, and the scheduler will schedule some other thread. After 100
us the real-time thread will be ready again. This will invoke the
scheduler, which will schedule our real-time thread, which will loop back
into snooze, which will invoke the scheduler again, and so on...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830272"></a>What About Non-Interactive Animations Running at 60 fps?</h3></div></div></div><p>
This case is very different. Since the animations are not interactive,
the different frames can sometimes be buffered ahead so that the impact
of losing 20% of the CPU time in a frame is not that important.
Probabilities tell us that a program that uses 90% of the total CPU power
and can buffer ahead 1/3 of its computation can resist two reschedules of
another thread in two frames, which (on average) happens less than once
every 10 minutes.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830291"></a>What Priorities Should I Use for a Full-Screen App?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Some people have been talking about using real-time priorities for tasks
that require lots of CPU power. This is a very bad idea. One uses
real-time priorities for tasks that do not use much (if any) CPU power,
but that need to be rescheduled extremely quickly. A task that uses all
available CPU power should not run at high priorities. You want the user
to be able to switch to other applications and have those applications
stay reasonably responsive.
</p><p>
Here's a rule of thumb: bumping the priority of a thread that already
uses most of the CPU will not make it run much faster, but will make
other tasks run much slower. The priority of a thread running a CPU-heavy
task should be related to how long that thread is going to run:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If the thread is doing a task that the user is not going to wait for
(e.g., something that might take several hours or several days), use
the lowest possible priority (1).
</p></li><li><p>
If the thread is doing something that's still long, but short long
enough so that the user might want to use the computer while waiting
(e.g., something that lasts for a few minutes), use <code class="constant">B_LOW_PRIORITY</code> (or
<code class="constant">B_NORMAL_PRIORITY</code> if the task doesn't take more than a minute).
</p></li><li><p>
If the thread is doing something related to direct user interaction
through a regular user interface (e.g., if the thread redraws the
preview of a filter in an image-procesing program while the user moves
a slider), use <code class="constant">B_NORMAL_PRIORITY</code> if the task lasts more than a second,
or <code class="constant">B_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code> if the computation only takes a fraction of a
second.
</p></li><li><p>
If the thread is doing some full-screen display, you can use <code class="constant">B_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code>.
<code class="constant">B_URGENT_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code> should only be used for
critical parts of a full-screen application (e.g., the game engine of
an application might be running at <code class="constant">B_URGENT_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code>, while the
display threads should only run at <code class="constant">B_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code>).
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id830388"></a>How Does All This Work in the Real World?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Well, here are some results. I wrote three tiny programs. The first just
looks at itself while it runs: it keeps track of how long it took it
between two calls to system time(). The second is one of those annoying
programs: it just spins in a loop without ever blocking. The third spawns
a real-time thread that causes the scheduler to be invoked more often.
</p><p>
The test program (the first one) was run at priority 20, the annoying
program ran at priority 10, ans the rescheduler (the third one) runs a
<code class="code">snooze(125);</code> in a loop.
</p><p>
Here's a summary of the results: The left column counts how many times
the test program was interrupted for more than 256 us. The right column
shows the longest time the test program was interrupted. In all the
cases, the test program took 256 million samples. The "bare-bones" system
is a system with only the kernel and the app server. The "normal" system
is a system where all the OS services are running, plus a dozen
applications.
</p><pre class="screen">
bare-bones                          35            3060
bare-bones, with annoying program  136            3219
bare-bones, with annoying
program and rescheduler            365             459
normal                             702            4776
normal, with annoying program     1139            6127
normal, with annoying program
and rescheduler                   2970             838
</pre><p>
Two conclusions can be drawn from those results:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Even on a bare-bones system, a thread with a high priority can be
interrupted for several milliseconds. It is useless to try to turn down
OS services hoping that it fixes the scheduling gaps, because it
doesn't.
</p></li><li><p>
Even on a moderately loaded system, using a rescheduler can help to
spread the CPU load more evenly between tasks, at the cost of a bigger
overhead (which you cannot see on my reasult, but can definitely be
measured).
</p></li></ul></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevWorkshop4-45"></a>Developers' Workshop: The Ying to the Server's Yang</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Eric</span> <span class="surname">Shepherd</span></span></div></div></div><p>
In my last article for the newsletter, I presented a simple network
server program that would respond to connections by spewing back the
entire contents of a file, with a very simple header.
</p><p>
<a class="xref" href="Issue4-41.html#DevWorkshop4-41" title="Developers' Workshop: Serving It Up: Creating a Simple Server Application">Developers' Workshop: Serving It Up: Creating a Simple Server
Application</a>
</p><p>
I received a few emails thanking me for this example, but a couple of
them suggested that I should also show the other side of the coin: how
about a client designed to access this server?
</p><p>
So this week we'll have a look at Requester, the counterpart to the
Responder program created in my last article.
</p><p>
Before we begin, I should point out a trio of matching silly bugs in
Responder:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">connect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Send</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="varname">count</code>);

<span class="type">ssize_t</span> <code class="varname">size</code> = <code class="varname">file</code>.<code class="methodname">Read</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 65536);
<code class="varname">connect</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Send</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="varname">size</code>);
</pre><p>
On these three lines in the <code class="function">send_file()</code> function, the "&amp;" is unnecessary
(and is in fact a major bug). The code worked, but was stomping loudly
through memory. Just take those "&amp;" characters out and everything will be
much better.
</p><p>
OK, on to the Requester program:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;NetAddress.h&gt;
#include &lt;NetEndpoint.h&gt;
#include &lt;File.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;OS.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;


static <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="function">request</code>(<span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">host</code>, <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">filename</code>);

<span class="type">int</span> main(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">argc</code>, <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">argv</code>[]) {
    <span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">filename</code>;
    <span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">host</code>;
    <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code>;

    if (<code class="parameter">argc</code> != 3) {
        <code class="function">printf</code>("usage: requester &lt;host&gt; &lt;filename&gt;\n");
        return 1;
    }

    <code class="varname">host</code> = <code class="parameter">argv</code>[1];
    <code class="varname">filename</code> = <code class="parameter">argv</code>[2];

    <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">request</code>(<code class="varname">host</code>, <code class="varname">filename</code>);

    if (<code class="varname">err</code> == <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
        <code class="function">printf</code>("File received.\n");
    } else {
        <code class="function">printf</code>("An error occurred receiving the file.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre><p>
The primary purpose to <code class="function">main()</code>, as in Responder, is to parse the command
line and dispatch control. As a client, we won't bother to spawn any
additional threads. We just grab the first argument as the hostname to
connect to and the second as the filename with which we'll save the
retrieved file. We then call <code class="function">request()</code> to actually handle the networking.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">status_t</span> request(<span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">host</code>, <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">filename</code>) {
    <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> <code class="varname">server</code>;
    <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="varname">first_buffer</code> = <code class="constant">true</code>;
    <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="varname">buffer</code>[65536];
    <span class="type">uint8 *</span><code class="varname">bufstart</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">count</code>;
    <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">header</code>[32];
    <span class="type">off_t</span> <code class="varname">filesize</code>;
    <code class="classname">BFile</code> <code class="varname">file</code>;

    if (<code class="varname">server</code>.<code class="methodname">InitCheck()</code> &lt; <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
        return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
    }
</pre><p>
As in Responder, we start by instantiating a <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> and then we
check to ensure that it's valid by calling <code class="methodname">InitCheck()</code>. If it's invalid,
we return an error.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">server</code>.<code class="methodname">Connect</code>(<code class="varname">host</code>, 4242); <span class="comment">// Connect to server</span>
    if (err &lt; <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
        goto bail;
    }
</pre><p>
Then we connect to the host, whose name was specifed by the user on the
command line. If this fails, we use the oft-debased but occasionally
handy goto statement to bail out of the <code class="function">request()</code> function.
</p><p>
After this, the loop to receive the file begins, since immediately after
we connect to the server, we'll begin receiving data. We use a while loop
to continue to receive until there's no more data. Since there's a header
that needs to be parsed, we special-case the first buffer using the first
buffer flag. Once we've received the first buffer, we clear the flag so
we won't look for the buffer anymore.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
    while ((<code class="varname">count</code> = <code class="varname">server</code>.<code class="methodname">Receive</code>(<code class="varname">buffer</code>, 65536)) &gt; 0) {

            if (!<code class="varname">filesize</code>) {
                <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
                goto bail;
            }
            <code class="varname">i</code>++;
            <code class="varname">bufstart</code> = &amp;(<code class="varname">buffer</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>]);

</pre><p>
If the <code class="varname">first_buffer</code> flag is <code class="constant">true</code>, we begin by clearing it so we don't try
to parse headers out of future blocks. Then we copy the header into the
header string. Since the header is always a one-line string (either the
file size in bytes or "ERROR" followed by a newline), this is easy to do.
</p><p>
Once the header has been grabbed, we check to see if it's "ERROR". If so,
we return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code> to the caller. Otherwise, we use <code class="function">atoll()</code> to get the
file's size from the header. Then we set <code class="varname">bufstart</code>, our buffer pointer, to
point past the header, and subtract the appropriate number of bytes from
the buffer size in count.
</p><p>
Then the file is opened; if this fails, we return the appropriate error.
</p><p>
If the buffer isn't the first, we simply set the <code class="varname">bufstart</code> pointer to the
beginning of the buffer, since we want to process all of it.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
        <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">file</code>.<code class="methodname">Write</code>(<code class="varname">bufstart</code>, <code class="varname">count</code>);
        if (err &lt; <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
            goto bail;
        }
    }

    <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="constant">B_OK</code>;

bail:
    <code class="varname">server</code>.<code class="methodname">Close()</code>;
    return <code class="varname">err</code>;
}
</pre><p>
Then we write the buffer to the file, starting at offset <code class="varname">bufcount</code>, and
writing <code class="varname">count</code> bytes. If an error occurs, we bail out. Otherwise we
continue looping until <code class="methodname">Receive()</code> returns 0, meaning the connection has
closed. We then close the <code class="classname">BNetEndpoint</code> and return.

This working client shares limitations with the Responder server—it
sets the filename of the retrieved file to the name the user specifies on
the command line (the server doesn't tell the client what to call the
file), and file attributes aren't maintained. Only the file's data is
transmitted. If you transmit an application, you'll have to chmod +x the
file before you can run it.

When an idea, a proposition, a cause is presented to me in terms that
leave me no alternative but to be for it, because it's all pros and no
cons, then I know I'm being conned. How can I be against freedom? How can
I be against innovation? How can I be against freedom to innovate? So,
when I hear Microsoft's carefully orchestrated refrain—all we ask is
the freedom to innovate, we'll never renounce our freedom to innovate --
being sung by top executives and paid consultants, I wonder. Do they
really believe this? Or is it a calculated bet on what our emotional
response to an appeal to higher principles will be?
</p><p>
Last Friday, November 5th, Judge Jackson gave his decoding of Microsoft's
refrain. His finding of facts concludes that Microsoft is a monopoly. To
quote his concluding paragraph:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
... Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its
prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any
firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could
intensify competition against one of Microsoft's core
products. Microsoft's past success in hurting such
companies and stifling innovation deters investment in
technologies and businesses that exhibit the potential
to threaten Microsoft. The ultimate result is that some
innovations that would truly benefit consumers never
occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide with
Microsoft's self-interest.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The entire document is at &lt;http://usvms.gpo.gov/findfact.htm&gt;. It's long
(412 paragraphs), but worth reading. It's written in plain English and
takes pains to establish definitions for products and markets in order to
create a structure for the findings.
</p><p>
The net effect of the finding is troubling. Even for someone as
ambivalent (as in having truly mixed feelings) as yours truly towards
Microsoft, my emotions range from surprise to sadness, laced with the
expected irritation. Surprise, because I didn't expect the breadth and
depth of abuse of power discussed by Judge Jackson's. From large
companies such as IBM or Intel, to ISVs, service providers, and tiny
start-ups such as ours, no one seems to escape Microsoft's vigilance.
"Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions have
conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the
computer industry", concludes the Judge.
</p><p>
My sadness at the language and conclusions of the finding comes from
looking at the impenetrable wall of paranoia and misunderstanding. I'm
reminded of a six-hour conversation I had with Bill Gates at a PC Forum
conference early in 1988. He complained repeatedly that Apple didn't
trust him, and nothing I said could help him see why his actions and
words created fear and distrust.
</p><p>
A decade later, I've personally seen grown men fear for their company and
themselves at the thought of incurring Bill's wrath and Microsoft's
retaliation if they didn't "behave." DOJ officials spoke bitterly about
PC makers' unwillingness to come forward to testify about Microsoft's
business practices. Perhaps, but they would have done so at great
potential cost. I'm in no position to blame them; I declined to testify
because it might have interfered with other projects that were then
pending at our company and also because testifying would have cost us
hundreds of thousand of dollars in legal fees. We couldn't take those
risks.
</p><p>
Still on the topic of the wall of misunderstanding, there is Microsoft's
"what's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable" attitude. Bill Neukom,
the company's chief legal eagle, takes the position that "It's our song"
when asked about the restrictions placed on Windows licensees. It's our
song and we're free to dictate the way it'll be played on PCs. This is a
strange metaphor. If I pay the royalties, I'm free to sing "Let it Be" in
any key I want, preceded and followed by whatever act I fancy.
</p><p>
Returning to Microsoft's licensing, they used it as a club to prevent
potentially errant PC makers from making BeOS visible to their customers.
It "works" like this: You can use Microsoft's boot manager to load any
number of OSes, as long as they're made by Microsoft. If you (the PC OEM,
Windows licensee) use a non-Microsoft boot loader, you cannot use it to
load Windows. If you do, you're in violation of the license and you could
lose it—and your business.
</p><p>
That's how Microsoft prevented Hitachi from visibly offering Windows and
BeOS at boot time. BeOS was loaded on the hard disk, but the customer
didn't see the choice at boot time. You'd have to read complicated
instructions to set up a dual-boot situation yourself. A neat legal trick
that effectively prevents PC OEMs from offering a genuine dual-boot
situation featuring both Windows and BeOS.
</p><p>
In that context, when I'm asked what Judge Jackson's ruling changes for
us, I have to say that in the short-term, materially, not much.
Psychologically, however, it's different. The ruling could open minds
and, perhaps, doors. By shedding light on Microsoft's practices, the
finding of fact might limit the company's ability to leverage its
dominance of the PC market into the emerging Web appliance sector. As for
specific remedies, they constitute a complicated, controversial topic.
Fortunately, I found one well-written survey of this issue in this week's
Time magazine (dated November 15th), shorter than Judge Jackson's
document but balanced and complete nonetheless.
