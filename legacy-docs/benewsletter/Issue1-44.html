At the Macworld Expo in Boston last August, Be demonstrated a version of
the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ running on Macintosh hardware. In light of all the mischief
this caused, a brief romp through the technical issues should be
entertaining. At least to some.
</p><p>
How did we get the BeOS to run on a Mac? Tackling the intricacies of
starting an alternate operating system using the Mac ROM's Open Firmware
was too much to stomach on the hard deadline schedule that we had for
Macworld. So, we took the easy route: Rather than boot from scratch, we
let the Mac OS come up, and then we launched the BeOS as an application.
The application is called OS Doubler, a name sure to send some lawyers
scurrying for their legal pads and cell phones. Lest they get too upset,
remember that this was just a demo.
</p><p>
OS Doubler loads a piece of code that's remarkably similar to the boot
ROM in the BeBox. This code is called BeOS_Enabler—a name that is, we
realized later, a bit confusing since it has nothing to do with Mac
"enablers." More lawyers—yikes!
</p><p>
Once BeOS_Enabler is loaded, the application grabs complete control of
the machine and jumps to the start of the enabler. From there, things
proceed much as they do on the BeBox: Look for disks with a Be file
system, find a kernel, load it, start the app_server, and so on. The Mac
memory image slowly disappears, eroded by the constant infusion of
vibrant new BeOS code.
</p><p>
The Mac version of the BeOS differs very little from the BeBox version.
The kernel is different, and a few drivers were added and some removed to
address the different peripheral hardware controllers. The rest of the
software is the same.
</p><p>
What Macintosh platforms does/will the BeOS run on? The demo ran on a
very limited subset: The 7200-based platform with a 604. In fact, it
didn't support the 604e when we arrived in Boston. Power Computing lent
us one of their new boxes, we got the kernel sources in the booth after
hours, added 604e support back in the hotel room, and demonstrated a 225
MHz system the next day!
</p><p>
Here's a list of the architectures that we support now and those that we
plan to support in the coming months:
</p><p>
Now (the demo):
</p><pre class="screen">
Power Computing PowerCenter (7200, 604)
Power Computing PowerTower (7200, 604)
Power Computing PowerTower E (7200, 604e)
</pre><p>
November developer release (DR8 software with better Mac support):
</p><pre class="screen">
Power Computing PowerWave (9500, 604)
Power Computing PowerTower Pro (9500, 604e)
Apple 9500 (604)
Apple 7600 (604)
Apple 8500 (604)
UMax S900 (9500, 604)
</pre><p>
Q1 97 (DR9 with complete Mac support):
</p><pre class="screen">
Power Computing PowerBase (5400, 603)
Apple 5400
</pre><p>
The 9500 support involves writing a few graphics card drivers as there is
no onboard graphics controller in that machine. We need to write a SCSI
Interface Module (SIM) for the 9500's MESH SCSI controller. We also want
to quickly add support for the onboard Ethernet controller—for
Macworld, we used one of the PCI cards we ship in the BeBox.
</p><p>
Supporting the multiprocessing cards is high on the list as well. The
BeOS is built for SMP from the ground up, so this is a natural fit.
Barring any unforeseen technical problems, this should be
straightforward. All the words count here...
</p><p>
Living comfortably in the Mac world is very important. Media sharing,
network compatibility, and installation all are important issues. We will
tackle them all and come out with the BeOS on the Macintosh in Q1 next
year.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="News1-44"></a>News From The Front: A Pleasurable Stick?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">William</span> <span class="surname">Adams</span></span></div></div></div><p>
I recently joined Be, Inc. as a Technical Evangelist. My mission (as I've
decided to define it) is to spread merriment, write code, and help
developers realize how fun, easy, and beneficial it is to develop
applications for the BeOS. To this end I will be producing a number of
applications and tools that help developers get the most out of our
system. At the same time, I want to find out what you're thinking and get
your comments right back to the Be engineers as quickly as possible.
</p><p>
I've been one of you before: I was a third-party developer, critic,
sometime-advisor, and guinea pig for NeXT and NT. I've also worked with
things that never really saw the light of day, such as Taligent.
</p><p>
I'm a decent, highly opinionated programmer who thinks he has something
to say about everything. And that's why I joined Be. I like the BeOS so
much that I couldn't pass up the opportunity to take my opinions right to
the source where they will have the most impact.
</p><p>
I really enjoy the bleeding edge. I feel most comfortable pushing the
envelope, while at the same time presenting with dramatic understatement
the power of a new technique, algorithm, or paradigm.
</p><p>
The BeOS offers a fertile ground upon which many applications will find
purchase. As I see it, my job is to help developers ply their trades on
this fertile ground and produce applications that they and their users
will find great pleasure in and laugh giddy with excitement down the
halls because it was so easy to do. But the system isn't perfect and is
ever-evolving. So that's the other part of my job, to bring your comments
into our house so our engineers can benefit from our developers' wisdom
to make a better system.
</p><p>
Every week I'll present "News from the Front" in the "Be Newsletter."
There's a lot of information in the Be community—some of it ends up on
the comp.sys.be news group, some ends up on the BeDevTalk mailing list,
and still more shows up on the ftp.be.com ftp site. I'll summarize some
of the more interesting things and try to highlight new apps that no one
can do without.
</p><p>
In addition to the highlights, we'll put out "From The Bench." These are
application snippets that either I have written, or I have wrenched out
of the hands of some poor unsuspecting engineer while they were screaming
"it's not clean enough yet!!"
</p><p>
To start things off, my first sample deals with the care and feeding of
the game controller ports on the BeBox. This sample code shows how these
interfaces can be used in a multithreaded environment to maximum
effectiveness. Some of the concepts demonstrated are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
Polling a device using a thread
</li><li>
Automatic calibration and self-centering a joystick
</li><li>
Message dispatching
</li></ul><p>
The tutorial packet can be found at:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/Joystick.tgz
</p><p>
I have also taken on responsibility for the sample code that currently
exists at the site. I hope to keep it up-to-date with the current
release, and will archive old stuff for posterity.
</p><p>
Well, I weaseled my way into this issue of the newsletter, and even
wangled myself a permanent spot. So, I hope y'all are ready to have some
fun, because I'm enthusiastic about programming this OS, and I intend to
spread my infectious enthusiasm as widely as possible.

The goal of my endeavors with the Be system is to develop low-cost
molecular modeling software for students and researchers who need power
and a sophisticated graphic interface, but who don't have the financial
resources for an SGI. My interest is in providing a software tool that
has the performance to allow users to visualize their ideas without being
chained to the canned algorithms supplied with many commercial
applications.
</p><p>
Currently, I am completing a PhD in molecular biophysics. Most of my work
is developing computational studies that predict the structural stability
of proteins under changing solution conditions. But a personal interest
in computers has taken me further towards software than science. My
NeXTstation is still running as good as the day I bought it six years
ago, and when I first heard of Be, it seemed a kindred spirit. In
addition, the multiprocessor technology is appealing since it promises
better price/performance for the kind of graphics-intensive work I am
interested in.
</p><p>
Working with Be is a chance to find like-minded people with a vision who
are willing to take risks. The port of OpenGL® sounds like another
opportunity to expand my horizons, but I hope to incorporate its
strengths into my software. So far, the hardest thing for me has been
figuring out how to organize a commercial-grade application (all thrust,
no vector). The projects I have designed myself are relatively large but
nothing I would think of as having commercial characteristics (for
example, robust error checking, standard documentation, and
upgradability).

As a relative newcomer to the US, much of my knowledge of the culture of
this great country has been derived from what I read and saw while still
a resident of England. During my formative years, I learned all that I
needed to know about the US by watching Kojak, Hawaii-Five-O, Scooby-Doo,
The Monkees, and Lost in Space, and by reading books about American
history. One learning experience stayed most strongly with me and,
ultimately, affected my decision to move to California: A British
documentary about the eccentricities of Californians. Nobody loves and
embraces an eccentric quite like the British, and nobody is able to
examine the eccentrics of other nations with quite the same combination
of smug superiority and restrained amusement.
</p><p>
The documentary in question portrayed a number of activities popular in
California during the 1980s: Self-trepanning (cutting a hole in one's
skull, mostly to see what would happen), crystal therapy, psychic
counseling, and (my favorite) channeling. It was channeling that most
caught my attention: Earnest individuals who claimed that, during what
Edgar Allen Poe called "moments of exquisite tranquillity," their minds
were controlled by spirits. For those brief moments, they became
representatives of the spirits, speaking in their voices and generally
behaving like them. My decision to move to California was partly
solidified by seeing one such person seated in a room filled with bemused
Californians who had paid $295 for the privilege, channeling a deceased
dolphin. As the possessed channeler squeaked, clicked, whistled, and
hissed, I concluded that any state that would put up with this would
definitely tolerate my relatively mild peculiarities. And any state where
people would pay $295 to watch this would probably afford me a decent
living.
</p><p>
The people with holes in their skulls, those with fingers callused from
rubbing too many crystals, those who no longer feel the spirit of the
dolphin and the ones who've put away their crystal balls survive (mostly)
into the 1990s as HR managers and 900-number psychic friends. But the
concept of channeling remains interesting to me and, with a little luck,
to you.
</p><p>
Be is a small company, with growing, but modest, sales. Most of our
customers are developers, and most of them interact directly with us.
However, as our application base grows, so will the number of people
using a BeBox or the BeOS to do something other than develop programs.
Some of those people will want to buy directly from our web site, while
others will prefer to deal with someone more local, more relevant to
their application, or simply someone more familiar. It's important to
everyone at Be to stay close to our customers, because it makes good
business sense and because, well, we like customers! So our strategy is
to create channels that can represent both Be's spirit, and Be's products.
</p><p>
During the next few weeks, I'll be exploring our channel strategy. As
always, I'm very interested in your comments and feedback. In our channel
strategy, we're aiming for simplicity, just as with the rest of what we
do. So you won't see a whole lot of discussion of staircase discounts,
minimum commitments, coop funds, bill backs, and other channel arcana.
</p><p>
The earliest, and perhaps the simplest, channel for Be products is Value
Added Resellers (VARs). Already, some of our developers, with products
nearing completion, wish to sell a packaged solution to their customers.
That package includes some combination of BeBoxes, the BeOS, custom
hardware, and custom software. This is the simplest and "purest" channel
in that the customer is really buying the solution, and not just a BeBox
or just the BeOS. The customer may not even know or care that Be
technology is present; do you really care if your car's trip computer is
managed by a Motorola or Intel CPU? The VAR is responsible for first-line
customer support, with Be providing warranty and software support to the
VAR as required. In return for providing volume sales, a single ordering
point, and first- line support, the VAR is able to buy Be hardware and
software at a discount. Conflict between VARs is minimal, as each has its
own unique value to add and the customer is choosing on the basis of
solution quality, not hardware pricing. Our VAR program is ready to roll,
so if you're a Be developer wanting to package a solution for your
customers, rather than simply selling software and letting customers
assemble the solution themselves, please drop me a line.
</p><p>
In future articles, we'll explore other channels, none of which, sadly,
are as simple as the VAR channel, but which offer the dual promises of
choice and flexibility.

One of our early shareholders passed away. Seymour Cray. Two weeks ago,
on a highway North of Colorado Springs, a driver made a risky passing
move. Seymour's Jeep was broadsided and rolled over. Seymour suffered
massive head, neck, and chest injuries and died last Saturday in the
early morning hours. He was 71.
</p><p>
I met Seymour for the first time in December 1985 in Eau Claire,
Wisconsin. As Apple was purchasing a Cray X-MP for its R&amp;D organization,
we came to visit the Cray Research production line and meet the great
man. Later, in 1989, Seymour invited me to serve on the board of
directors of his new company, Cray Computer Corporation, located in
Colorado Springs. There, I witnessed him challenge the laws of physics --
and capital formation—until the company folded in 1995.
</p><p>
When I left Apple and started Be, Seymour kindly expressed interest in
helping us. So one day in September 1991, Steve Sakoman and I flew to
Colorado Springs and gave a presentation of our project to Seymour and
Neil Davenport, the company's CEO. Seymour stood still during the process
and asked very few questions—I was terrified and wondered if I had
said something unspeakably stupid. We rode to dinner in Seymour's Jeep,
he never locked it and left the keys in the ashtray, an amazing habit for
someone born and raised in Paris. On the way to the restaurant, Seymour
jokingly complained to Neil that he was losing money on his gold
investments. I suggested a stake in Be might be a way to compensate for
that. He smiled: "Why not?" Finally, at the dinner table, I had to ask if
he meant what he'd said in the Jeep. Yes. How much? One million. Seymour
never wasted words.
</p><p>
A month later we had dinner at my house in Palo Alto and a misfolded
carpet caused a plateful of osso bucco to take flight and hit the dining
room wall. As we nonetheless got Seymour's check the following day, the
dish became known in the Gasse family as the million dollar osso bucco.
</p><p>
Seymour's career is too well documented for me to add much to the public
record. His name became synonymous with supercomputers, and we're sure to
see many articles, books and web sites celebrating his achievements. One
of us, Dominic Giampaolo, suggests the following two URLs:
http://www.usa.net/gazette and
http://innovate.si.edu/history/cray/craytoc.htm.
</p><p>
The media made much of Seymour's alleged or real eccentricities. "Time"
magazine yesterday made derogatory comments about a habit Seymour had for
a part of his life: Building a boat during winter, sailing it during
summer, and burning it when autumn came. I had asked him about this. He
just wanted to move on to the next design, unencumbered by the past.
Something he did all his life when he started Control Data, then left and
started Cray Research, going to a repro shop to print stock certificates
and selling shares from the Control Data parking lot.
</p><p>
My last meeting with him was in June of this year. He was quite
philosophical about the demise of his last venture and ready to start a
new one. At the time, he was considering a deal for Intel's ailing
supercomputer business, for the customer list he said. In any event, he
had ideas for the large memory systems required by supercomputers and
"having been hit over the head enough by microprocessors" intended to use
them in his next design. I'm sad to see Seymour die prematurely, in the
midst of planning yet another start-up, SRC, but he led a good life and
I'm grateful for his generous help and for the memories of a hero of our
industry.

BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501537"></a>WEEK 5</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501543"></a>Subject: AES/EBU</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">Subject: COMPLETE Newsletter article #42, September 25, 1996</h5></div></div></div><p>
If Be can't provide highest-quality audio equipment because of the
cost, could Be at least build some extensions to the hardware that it
could sell to audio-interested developers? The theory is that Be could
do a better job of building and supporting their own hardware than a
third party could do with a card.
</p><p>
The premise of the no-AES reasoning was questioned: It was contended
that computer users are (or should?) be willing to pay for good audio
as part of a base technology.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501572"></a>WEEK 2</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501578"></a>Subject: Application Architecture</h4></div></div></div><p>
Can you use the same image as both an add-on and a distinct executable?
Yes. This flexibility was lauded, but its corollary—executables and
add-ons have the same file type—was condemned.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501594"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501600"></a>Subject: There is no OS UI like no OS UI.</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: hot boot</h5></div></div></div><p>
Should the UI and the OS be "just friends?" It was suggested that the
Be GUI be abstracted from the OS proper, thus allowing different GUI
standards on, potentially, different hardware. The rebuttal: A nice
theory, but the overhead to "re-couple" the two layers (messaging, for
example) would probably be deadly.
</p><p>
This led to a discussion of "hot booting," different schemes to
decrease boot time: "snooze" mode; ROM-loaded OS; loadable,
preconfigured environments.

This human interface thread focused, mainly (but only as an example),
on the "correct" ways to dismiss an application. Should a developer
define app-specific quit methodologies (such as double-clicking a
window's title bar)? Or should deference to the user's learned
behaviour be the guide?

A call was made for a show of hands of those folks who use a BeBox as
their "everyday" computer.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501682"></a>Subject: OS services...</h4></div></div></div><p>
It was suggested that the BeOS should provide some sort of URL
recognition, such that you could open an Internet address just as
easily as you can open a file.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501696"></a>Subject: Plug-in thought</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should Be settle on a standard for "global" add-ons (or plug-ins)? It
was considered a reasonable request to allow a single add-on to be
called by *any* application that can use the add-on.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501710"></a>Subject: PPC Optimisation question</h4></div></div></div><p>
This week's computer science question asked for the fastest method of
stuffing four bytes into a single <span class="type">ulong</span>. The answer: Use assembly code.
This lead to a discussion of the utility of register declarations (not
needed), and some questioning of the way certain inline (and so header-
visible) functions are implemented.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501731"></a>Subject: Real Desktop?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should the Be "desktop" act like a general-purpose clipboard (a la
Macintosh)? Some say yes, some no, and, of course, there was a vote for
providing a preference to let the user choose.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id501745"></a>Subject: App-server connection</h4></div></div></div><p>
Can the message-based communication between an application and the app
server be extended to allow the user to "drag" a window or running
application between BeBoxes?
