My first day at Be happened to coincide with the start days of two
interns, William Bull and John Standerfer, both gone now but with a
lasting impression left in their wakes. For some time I was viewed by
others as just another intern with a finite time-span in the company.
Maybe it's because of how I look or carry myself or the inane questions I
ask. Perhaps it's because I feel comfortable just sitting behind a
computer and trudging through header files. Now, as the interns leave and
new ones enter our doors I have often been stopped by other Be employees
who ask how much longer I will be around. I think to myself, "Do they
want to get rid of me so soon?"
</p><p>
Playing with software or hardware in development (that "Bleeding Edge"
stuff) has often been called living life dangerously, working on the high
wire without a net. One might get a shock from a piece of hardware (yes,
I've done that many times); one might fry a new board or hard drive (yup,
made that happen); or, you might start a little fire (well, it was little
before I left the room!).
</p><p>
It really isn't dangerous, though. Have you ever thought what a test
pilot thinks before he takes a new plane up? "Well, gee, it's not
preventing me from doing this, so I guess I'll just have to try it." Ever
heard of a test pilot, after crashing, ask the engineers where the reset
button is? Okay, so I will admit that corrupting an OS or losing lots of
data is a real pain and can get quite tedious day after day, but it is
kind of amusing in a masochistic sense.
</p><p>
When I arrived, we were in the middle of Mac compatibility testing, for
DR8 that is. Often times someone would come in and ask, "Where's the
8500?", "Is that computer a Tanzania?", "Have you tried, 'such and such'
on Power Computing 'foo'?" Then I started to realize that there are a lot
of configurations to deal with nowadays. So, we started to build a lab,
of sorts. We acquired many different models of Macs (still only a small
subset of what exists), wired them all up, and turned the switch. "Damn!
Why'd the power go out!", I heard from next door. Hmmm, I thought, "Why'd
the stereo just go off in the lab?" Oops, I guess I really shouldn't have
daisy chained four power strips from one outlet. The office—now
getting quite full with equipment and, often times, engineers—is at a
constant 75-80 degrees, and is looking forward to a nice wading pool with
flamingos and palm trees.
</p><p>
Black Box testing on a system or an application is always quite amusing.
You get to try the most stupid, ridiculous things, wallow through
incredibly tedious processes, and perform some quite natural actions.
Then, of course, you get to answer the question from the engineer, "Now
why would you ever do that?," almost always with the simple practiced
reply, "Because I could."
</p><p>
To effectively test it would appear that you simply need to poke into
regions of the brain of the engineers who created the stuff you worked
on. After a period of probing you begin to discover when they got tired
or when the caffeine wore off, and the effects that had on their
creations. But, after this stage you have to discover or invent new ways
to break their creations. Often times, by asking leading questions, one
can find where they did not "bullet-proof" their code or skimped on the
robustness of a feature. On the other hand, by simply getting to know who
the engineer is you can discover how to not just break their work, but
also possibly enhance and help create a robust and working piece of
software or hardware. Okay, maybe it's a bit idealistic, but sometimes it
actually works.
</p><p>
When writing tools, I often think about what a doctor once told me after
I injured my back, "When I do this it hurts," "Well, then don't do that!"
Writing test tools has a balance between being an amusing task and one
that is extremely tedious. While one has the opportunity to play around
with the API of some system and create tools or applications with wild
abandon, a test tools writer also has to break down and trudge through
the multitude of classes and methods and address such issues as
performance and compliance. The results of this are applications that
simply and efficiently go out and fragment your disk, or ones that become
a robust but totally copyright-infringing reproduction of a well known
game.
</p><p>
Tools are also created that test the sanity of some engineers and test
the assumptions and patience of the use of things like void*. It is
always amusing to look over some API and to find a method or function
that allows a pointer to be passed in. Hmmm, I think, "What happens when
NULL is passed as that parameter?" Of course, the reply from the engineer
goes something like, "Well, don't do that! Do you really think I should
be checking for that? No one would ever pass that in...", and the rant
goes on.
</p><p>
So, here I sit in a lab with 20 computers, a multitude of monitors,
keyboards, boxes of cables, stacks of hard drives, dead equipment and the
air conditioning system wondering why it didn't just become that neat
little fan for an RV. We play with the stuff as it comes out, come up
with new scenarios in hopes that some user will never have to deal with
what we come up with, and arrive upon amusing uses for technology.
Working here never gets boring; new tasks and ideas appear every day.
Somehow I guess, the tasks and problems that we overcome define a role
that I play here. I just wish I knew what that was.

When I had been working at Be for about a week, William Adams came to my
cube and asked me to say "Please state the nature of the emergency." I
did it, and he laughed his inimitable laugh and walked away. It wasn't
until a few days went by, and I saw that week's episode of Star
Trek:Voyager, that I got the joke.
</p><p>
It would seem William thinks I resemble Robert Picardo, the Holographic
Doctor on Voyager.
</p><p>
I kind of like that. When people come to the Holographic Doctor he asks
them, in a very formal way, what the problem is. Since I read and respond
to a lot of the electronic mail that comes in to the Be offices,
including a fair number of requests for technical help, I frequently find
myself saying the e-mail equivalent of "please state the nature of the
emergency."
</p><p>
What makes a really good request for technical assistance is a formal
declaration of what is going wrong. When we get a request for help here
at Be, we love it when you tell us four things:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
what you were doing, and where you were doing it
</p></li><li><p>
what actually happened
</p></li><li><p>
what you think *should* have happened
</p></li><li><p>
detailed information about your BeOS system, including:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
computer make and model
</p></li><li><p>
BeOS system version (and Mac OS system, if you're on a Mac)
</p></li><li><p>
amount of RAM and hard drive size(s)
</p></li><li><p>
graphics/video interface and monitor type
</p></li><li><p>
*everything* plugged into internal expansion slots
</p></li><li><p>
anything else that's interesting about your computer
</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>
When we get this kind of information, one of two things generally
happens. Frequently, we instantly know what's wrong, and can answer
immediately. People seem to like this.
</p><p>
Failing that, we're at least in the position to try to replicate the
problem, and figure out what the solution might be, instead of having to
ask for more information. Either way, BeOS users get help a lot faster
than they might otherwise.
</p><p>
Of course, in the heat of an emergency, most people don't want to write a
lot of stuff in a help request, or sometimes skip items on the above
check list. Or sometimes the problem is fairly trivial, and it seems like
a bother to write all the details out into an e-mail message.
</p><p>
Ed Romson, our Director of Support, wrote in Newsletter #72 about one of
our solutions to this. We've created a Help Request web form, which we
are testing internally right now, that should make the process easier. It
will make it simple to remember to enter all of the information our
technical support group needs to solve the problem, and it will make it
easier to actually enter that information, by simply choosing items from
pop-up menus and checking radio buttons.
</p><p>
The Help Request form will make its debut around the same time as the
Preview Release, or a little before. When the form appears, you'll find
it in the Support section of the Be web site:
http://www.be.com/support/index.html.
</p><p>
Of course, some problems are so catastrophic that using a web form is not
possible. We will, as Ed wrote, continue to handle support requests via
e-mail and, soon, our support telephone number.
</p><p>
All of our available support resources are described on our web site:
http://www.be.com/support/index.html, which is updated constantly as we
add resources. If you have ideas for information or other resources to
add, that will help you to use the BeOS better, I'm eager to hear them.
Please write me at alderete@be.com. Formality not required. ;-)

A funny thing happened on the way to releasing the mkimghdr code from
last week. I tested with 8-bit GIF images and reawoke to the fact that
you can't make any app_server calls unless you have a connection to the
app_server, and that only happens if you have instantiated a BApplication
object, and preferably created a window object as well.
</p><p>
In particular, you can't call index_for_color(), or now
BScreen::IndexForColor(), unless you have met these criteria. Well, it's
actually out now, just in time to be revisited by discussion of why you
actually shouldn't do things this way in the first place. This just goes
to show you, you're never too good a programmer to slap your forehead and
say "Doh!"
</p><p>
Also last week, I mentioned the Wacom tablet code. Well after a similarly
delayed release, I did manage to put out the fiddling code. Why fiddling?
Because, you can open up the tablet and get all the information you want,
but it's not exactly "integrated" into the system. As has long been known
in the US, separate is not exactly equal. The current system may allow
you to talk to a graphics tablet, but it does not really view it as a
mouse! What can you do? You want to integrate your tablet in such a way
that the tablet can both be used as your primary system mouse as well as
get at the tilt, pressure and other information specific to a tablet.
</p><p>
The answer lies in a couple of places. First of all, there should be a
/dev/tablet device that you can talk to. This driver, if it were ideal,
would allow you to do a few simple things:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Allow you to setup various parameters like resolution, sensitivity
and the like.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow you to read the current settings
</p></li><li><p>
Allow you to get the current position information
</p></li></ul><p>
Generally the tablet position information should look something like:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct <code class="varname">tablet_position</code>
{
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">proximity</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">stylus</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">buttonflag</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span>   <code class="varname">x</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span>   <code class="varname">y</code>;
    <span class="type">uint32</span>  <code class="varname">buttons</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">pressuresign</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span>   <code class="varname">pressuredata</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">xtiltsign</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span>   <code class="varname">xtiltdata</code>;
    <span class="type">bool</span>    <code class="varname">ytiltsign</code>;
    <span class="type">int32</span>   <code class="varname">ytiltdata</code>;
};
</pre><p>
If you want to get the current position, you should be able to do
something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">fd</code>, <code class="constant">TABLET_GETPOS</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">position</code>);
</pre><p>
That would be nice, but how does that make it look like a mouse? Well, it
doesn't directly, unless the kb_mouse driver knew to open up this device
and get positional information from it instead of from the serial mouse.
Well, with a little fiddling about, you can create a new kb_mouse driver
that can recognize a serial mouse, a PS/2 mouse, or a tablet:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/wacom2.tgz
</p><p>
In your application, you will still have to query the tablet driver
yourself to find out about the tablet specific information, but at least
you'll have your tablet acting like a mouse. It shouldn't be too long
before some industrious soul creates a paint program that takes advantage
of the tablet specific features, specifically pressure, and the switch
between the nib and the eraser. Should be fun!

I'm headed to MacHack along with Benoît Schillings and Mark Gonzales.
Hopefully we'll be able to entice some more of the Macintosh faithful to
step into the light and generate some tractor-driving killers. Geoff
Woodcock is done fiddling with iso9660, and that's going to be great fun.
Now he's off to Europe.
</p><p>
And one last thing. In the past we have always distributed our samples
and whatnot using gzipped tar files, the familiar .tgz file extension.
Well, a new day is upon us. In the next release of the BeOS, the unzip
utility that Chris Herborth worked so hard on will be a standard part of
the system. What's so great about this? Well, the zip/unzip combo is a
little more flexible than the tar/gzip combo in that it preserves the
attributes associated with a file, and allows you to create
self-extracting archives rather easily. Thus, in the future, our samples
will be packed with zip instead of tar/gzip. We won't start yet, since we
don't want to deliver samples that require you to go outside the box, but
this will be our future direction.
</p><p>
So, it was my second Father's Day. When you're with a 2 year old, there
is never a moment of their life in which they think someone else might be
the center of the universe. Despite this, they do a fairly good job of
making you feel happy to be called daddy. Yasmin's not old enough to buy
me ugly ties, so she took me to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Groovy, man.
She was so wonderful and I had a really good time. And the best part was,
she was so exhausted when we got home, she was asleep within the hour. As
I kissed her good night, and shut the light, I had one last wish for this
Father's Day night... One more compile!
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-24"></a>Be Developer Funding</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
One question keeps coming back with increasing frequency: why don't we
invest in promising start-ups developing Be software? After all, without
application software we are nothing.
</p><p>
Such a move would make more likely availability of exciting applications
and it would leverage our own investment in the BeOS. (Let's quickly note
the "increasing frequency" is good news.) On the surface of things, our
investing in Be developers looks helpful. Yet, after careful
consideration, we found that, on balance, such a move wouldn't be helpful
to the commonwealth.
</p><p>
A first objection is easily defeated but leads to a more serious one. Too
much money involved. Indeed, we would have no trouble identifying one
hundred exciting projects, each one easily justifying one million dollars
apiece in mere seed money. We don't have that kind of money and we don't
think we should or could raise it. This company was started on the more
than ever valid premise that we operate on different metrics. By this we
mean we don't need the hundreds of millions of dollars larger companies
have to spend to write a new OS, more often than not ending up with an
unwieldy product.
</p><p>
Well, then, let's pick carefully a very small numbers of projects, thus
keeping our outside investments consistent with our philosophy. This
makes a partly hidden assumption: in fact, we'd be saying to ourselves
we're smarter, more experienced, and better connected than professional
investors, a.k.a. venture capitalists. This, I'm not prepared to assume.
</p><p>
It is one thing to trade criticisms sublimated into epigrams: VCs think
entrepreneurs are too stubborn, entrepreneurs think VCs are too greedy,
all is well. It is another to miss the essential point that investing is
a profession, a craft, or an art—I'm sucking up—very different from
our trade. Anointing or improvising ourselves investors could cause great
harm. Still, some companies have "internal" venture funds. To the best of
my knowledge, they rarely compare favorably with purely profit driven
funds.
</p><p>
Admittedly, I'm influenced by having watched one such example from the
inside. I observed frequent abuse of the word "strategic" in order to
cover for politics and other human factors unrelated to shareholder
value. Admittedly again, there are good counter-examples, they often
happen with the help of a real venture fund running the show for the
company. These are big and smart companies; we'll review the situation
when we can call ourselves that.
</p><p>
Another objection is our investing in one company would create tension
with other developers. Perhaps paradoxically, I could find a defense for
that one. If we make the Be platform more successful, everyone benefits,
not just Be shareholders and employees. Mangling metaphors: the tractor
app will raise all boats. Still, it would be a difficult balancing act,
it would create controversy and, as a result, absorb energy better spent
elsewhere. In the end, the overriding reasons are I'd rather not assume
we are smarter than the free market and the professionals accustomed to
swimming in it.

Is it better to port, or should the scrupulous developer re-write from
the ground up? Obviously, a re-write can show off more of a new OS's
native talents, but is it worth the extra effort and time? The "port or
not" threshold, for many folks, falls between developer tools (port
'em) and end-user apps (which should be all fresh and slippery). Rollin
Weeks:
</p><p>
"Fred Fish and others are performing a tremendous service to developers
in providing ports of things we already know how to use, even if we
have to use them from the shell in the beginning. If we were to adopt a
BeOS purist attitude, our development capabilities would be greatly
handicapped."
</p><p>
There was some frustration over the lack of Be-native apps—where are
the brave?—but a number of folks pointed out that a) There *are*
apps in development b) It's difficult to maintain steady forward
progress on a platform that's young and constantly changing its API c)
Working without UI guidelines is less than comforting d) Working on a
platform that doesn't have a huge built-in audience requires a lot of
faith. The general feeling was that there is a sufficient number of
people with sufficient faith, and porting is a great way to solidify
the indoctrination.
</p><p>
Another notion, somewhat orthogonal to the port/don't port question, is
that a new OS has to find itself a niche. Jake Hamby offers the
following niche possibilities:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The embedded arena (...think set-top boxes...).
</p></li><li><p>
Hard-core gamers (think 3D acceleration and "bang for the buck").
</p></li><li><p>
Scientific and engineering applications: a market that has yet to
be tapped...
</p></li><li><p>
New Internet technologies.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id568698"></a>Subject: Be Newsletter Issue #77, June 11, 1997</h4></div></div></div><p>
Rraster vs. the Datatypes lib. Which plug-in format does Be officially
support? Is it foolish to write Rraster codecs, or is this exactly what
the savvy Be developer should be doing?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Rraster codecs will work with the Datatypes library.
William Adams' continued work on the Rraster codecs shouldn't be taken
as an assault on the Datatypes beachhead. The bottom line: If you're
writing a codec, heed the Datatypes format.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id568720"></a>Subject: Prefs: Lowest Common Denominator is *NOT* C...</h4></div></div></div><p>
What's the best language/mechanism for designing a preferences

Straight C: It's easy, portable, and ubiquitous.
</p></li><li><p>
C++ <code class="classname">BMessage</code> subclass: More in keeping with the Be lifestyle.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>-like protocol: Similar to the above.
</p></li></ul><p>
It was admitted that C is much more portable, but is porting
preferences code useful or even desirable? Mixed feelings, here.
