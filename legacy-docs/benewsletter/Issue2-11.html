We all hate it when a piece of software crashes or misbehaves. Yet, it's
all too easy to write software that's fragile or "delicate." If you'll
allow me to step up to the white board for a few minutes, I'd like to
share a few thoughts about how to avoid some common coding problems.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id552847"></a>The Times They Are A-Ch&lt;SIGHUP&gt;</h3></div></div></div><p>
First and foremost: Be prepared to deal with a nonstatic world. The
possibility that an event might interrupt the normal flow of your program
is something you have to accommodate. That file you're reading may have
just been deleted by the user, or the data could have been overwritten.
Servers have to pay particular attention: The client you (the server)
were talking to just a moment ago may have died in the last second. This
can result in partially written data, responses that never get to the
intended recipient, half-completed transactions, and so on. When a
program starts up, it should verify that the files and operations it
wants to perform make sense, and that they will operate on valid data. A
server mustn't hang when a client disappears; the integrity of the user's
data must be preserved at all costs.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id552858"></a>Reading And Writing Files</h3></div></div></div><p>
Your program wants to read from a file. Can you assume that just because
the file exists that its data is valid? Certainly not. So what do you
check while reading? If your program writes files that it will read
later, then you can control the format in a known way: For example, you
can put magic values in the file to help detect file corruption, or
structure the file so each section is self-describing. But if you're
looking at a "generic" file, be particularly careful while reading it in.
Would your program crash if it read a file that went through an
ftp-induced CR/CRLF conversion? Hopefully not. Keep in mind that many
types of file corruption errors are accidental. Many users can trash
files without ever realizing it. To them, it's your fault.
</p><p>
Now your program wants to write some data to the disk. What sorts of
problems can you run into? You could run out of disk space, the disk
could catch on fire, the directory you were planning to save in may no
longer exist... If the size of the data you're writing isn't prohibitive,
it's wise to save to a temporary file and then, once you're sure the data
has been completely and safely written, rename the file to the name
requested by the user. This technique prevents the user from losing data
should the disk become full or catch on fire while you're saving.
</p><p>
Because DR9 is much better about dealing with out-of-disk- space errors,
the POSIX error value ENOSPC is very real and must be dealt with. Running
out of disk space should not be a catastrophic event to an application.
The free disk situation may change very quickly, so it's best if an
application can fail gracefully and allow the user to try again when disk
space is available.
</p><p>
Applications must also be able to deal with changes to the underlying
file system layout while they're running. On a system like the BeOS, it's
natural to flip back to the Tracker (nee Browser) to do some file
operations and then flip back to using an application. This can present
some difficulties for an application, but again, dealing with the
disappearance of files and directories is simply a fact of life. An error
returned from trying to save something in a particular directory should
bring up another Save panel or an alert panel indicating the error—it
shouldn't crash the application.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id552886"></a>Servers</h3></div></div></div><p>
To begin making a server robust, consider the ownership of the ports that
it uses. If the client owns the port that it reads from and the server
owns the port that the client writes to, then if either the client or the
server dies, the other can be made aware of the situation and clean up
accordingly. This works (in the BeOS) because when a team dies, any ports
it owns are deleted, and an error will be returned by the next read or
write on the surviving port. This is very important, but it's easy to
overlook (until recently even some of the homegrown Be servers didn't
handle this properly).
</p><p>
Another aspect of a server's job that can cause real headaches is that it
might not have much control over the quality of its clients: For every
well-behaved client program, there are any number that are poorly written
or possibly even intentionally malicious. A server should always validate
what has been sent to it by a client. A bug in the client may cause
improper data to be sent; a malicious client may try to trick a server by
giving it incorrect information. All fields and arguments passed to a
server from a client should be validated. Again, magic values in
structures can sometimes help as a first line of defense, but range
checking all values is also important (does a bitmap width of 2147483648
make sense?).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id552901"></a>Memory: Shared And Virtual</h3></div></div></div><p>
Shared memory is a great feature of the BeOS. It can make the sharing of
large amounts of data between two applications very efficient. However,
shared memory should only be used to share *data*, not to *control
information*. If you place control information in a shared area, one of
the sharing applications could accidentally write over it. It's much
safer to pass control information through a sideband channel, such as a
port or a pipe.
</p><p>
Another common error that programmers (especially UNIX programmers) make
is that they take the presence of virtual memory as a guarantee that all
memory allocation requests will always succeed. Virtual memory *is not*
infinite. It seems almost schoolmarmish of me to have to remind people to
check the return of <code class="function">malloc()</code> and <code class="function">new</code>...
but you absolutely must.
</p><p>
Part of our stress testing here at Be involves pushing a machine to its
limits by running out of memory and disk space at the same time.
Applications must be able to deal with these situations and fail as
gracefully as possible. And by the way, calling <code class="function">exit()</code> when <code class="function">malloc()</code>
fails is not considered "graceful."
</p><p>
I could go on, but it would be impossible for me to enumerate all of the
possible problems that an application could run into. My aim with this
article is to raise the consciousness of developers so that you'll think
about these issues when developing applications. If applications are
written to deal with inevitable errors and anomalies, then users will
develop more confidence in the application and in the system as a whole.

So when babies are first born, they have a basic set of immunities that
they inherit from their mothers. They don't really get sick in the first
couple of months, all screaming and crying aside. Then slowly over time
they build up their own immune system and get colds with the rest of us.
</p><p>
When Yasmin approached her first winter, our doctor said we could expect
her to get sick every six weeks or so!! Oh boy, what will this do to my
productivity. Well, as I have said in the past, I practiced for
fatherhood by learning to program quickly, without error, and
optimally... At least to my best effort.
</p><p>
Last week Yasmin was right on time for an illness. Funny thing for kids
and viruses. They fight them by raising their body temperatures to
ungodly levels to burn them out. Then the fever breaks and they're back
to running around and bouncing on you. So I was left at home one day with
her sleeping on my chest while I sat on the couch doing nothing... except
thinking about the programming that needed to get done, sick child or not.
</p><p>
In such situations, I thank my lucky stars that I get to program on the
BeOS. It's light, easy, and less filling. It allows for amazing feats,
and you can't even see my lips moving! I decided that for my one-day task
I would take a whack at the VideoPlayer code that we've been giving out
with our Hauppauge WinCast driver.
</p><p>
The Hauppauge WinCast/TV card made for successful demos at Macworld. We
subsequently gave the driver to some folks and the header and sample code
to others so they could write their own video applications. You must
understand, Steve Sakoman, the writer of the driver, is a hardware guy.
He's also responsible for our FireWire driver and a number of other
things, like early <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ designs. His sample software, although very
decent, doesn't quite have the OO and wasteful polish that developers
such as myself like to make money off of.
</p><p>
So, I took his VideoPlayer code, tweaked it, simplified, limited,
twisted, renamed, and called it my own.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/vidview.tgz
</p><p>
This sample code and included driver will allow you to use the WinCast
board to display some live video in a window on the screen. The code that
deals with the video stream is fairly isolated and can be replaced with
other video sources fairly simply, but that's for another time. The
package includes the latest driver and borrows some code from the
QCamView3 program.
</p><p>
The structure of the application is very simple. A thread basically goes
to the video source and asks for a frame, which is a pointer to a
BBitmap. It then displays it in a view, and asks for the next frame. It
shouldn't be too hard to imagine that this GetNextFrame() method could
easily be replaced by anything pretending to be a video source. QuickCam,
WinCast, MPEG. It shouldn't really matter. Perhaps these are just add-ons
that the user can use to select the source at run-time. I don't know.
</p><p>
A few months ago we were a multimedia platform with absolutely no support
for any video hardware. Then along came the QuickCam driver, and then the
more impressive WinCast driver. FireWire is knocking on the door, and
things are looking up.

And so. I've mentioned a couple of times the various forums available to
the Be developer community for communications. There are the news groups,
comp.sys.be.*, there's our own BeDevTalk, and now there are bugs on-line!
In case you haven't noticed, we're publishing our bugs on-line so that
developers don't have to go wondering whether something they're running
into is a known problem.
</p><p>
This should be a welcome sight to many developers. In conjunction with
the BeDevTalk list, it gives developers plenty of resources from which to
draw knowledge for development. It appears that some of our developers
have taken to making the BeDevTalk list a little more useful than it
currently is. You can find a nice web archive of the mailing list at:
</p><p>
http://www.bespecific.com
</p><p>
Once again, I'll be the first to admit that I have an association with
this company, but when they do good work, they deserve to be pointed out
as much as anyone else. I think this archive is a very useful tool that
makes the BeDevTalk list that much more valuable and usable as a
knowledge base.
</p><p>
In the past week we put out quite a few messages about the May
Developers' Conference, master's program, DR8.3 release, and other
things. If you're a registered developer, you'll want to make sure you to
update your record so that we know you're still alive and interested in
being in our developers' program.
</p><p>
So, here we are. DR8.3 has rescued us from the brink of the April 1 bomb.
DR9 will be later than expected. There are more new applications every
day, the sun is shining, Yasmin is now well again, and I'm proud to be a
part of one of the most exciting things since sliced silicon.

At first, it looks like a strange question. By now we ought to know,
right? Yet the question was given a new life by recent events as well as
by animated discussions on the net.
</p><p>
The events I refer to are our negotiations with Apple and our exit from
the hardware business. As for the discussions on the net, they're
voluminous, and the tone ranges from "You're great!" to "Who do you think
you are?" We appreciate the compliments and our gratitude goes to the
critics: They keep our enthusiasm under control and remind us of our
mortality. In any case, it's not a good idea to assume everyone knows or
agrees with the answer, nor that it is given once and for all. Put
another way, if the answer changes all the time, it's too tactical (I'm
being very polite). If it never changes, it's too abstract. You're dead,
or soon will be.
</p><p>
So what do we live for, why do we do what we do? Is the answer money,
ego, because we can, the technical challenge, fun, or dissing our elders?
Certainly a combination of all of these.
</p><p>
Let's start with the money. When I joined HP in June 1968, I was
horrified to see profit posted as HP's number one objective in new
employee induction material. The 1968 student riots had just ended, and I
came from a rather leftist Paris University background. The HR Director,
when I confronted him with this gross expression of naked capitalism, was
kind enough not to fire me on the spot. I've since mended my ways.
</p><p>
We do what we do to make money. If we do a good job, software developers
will make money, our OEMs and other business partners will make money,
our investors will make a killing, and we ourselves, lifted by the tide,
will pay off our mortgages, send our kids to college, or be able to
afford similar end-of-the-century extravaganzas. If we don't make money,
nothing else will matter. I write this not because I've become a
capitalist trapped inside the body of a Frenchman, but because I've
learned from painful experience what happens when the money motive takes
the back seat to loftier goals.
</p><p>
What about the ego? Of course it matters; everyone has one, even Mother
Theresa. And hers must be pretty healthy to have sustained her and driven
her to do all the good she has done. It's how we feed our egos that
matters. My hope is that we'll feed our egos by doing good work, building
something people enjoy, and serving our partners. They'll be the judges.
</p><p>
Because we can? Usually this is meant as doing something for its own
sake, with the expressed criticism that the goals are inward-looking as
opposed, for instance, to market driven. It's sometimes expressed as,
"Build it and they will come." We used to get this kind of criticism
during the formative years of the company. It was an honest disagreement,
but it hurt our fund-raising activities. Some people felt there was no
room for a new OS. We believed we could build one and find room for it.
We knew the legacy platforms were building more and more baggage, more
layers of software silt over time. And we saw we could avoid competing
with the entrenched leaders in the mature office productivity markets.
Instead, we'd focus on the emerging digital media applications, where no
giant predators would automatically eat a fledgling start-up alive. We
saw how to tilt the legacy versus baggage balance in our favor.
</p><p>
And the technical challenge? Yes. It's an important factor. You can't run
the kind of marathon race we're running if you're not excited by the
sport. It's interesting, it's fun, it's motivating. What better reward
than to see others excited by your work? If you meet a knee surgeon and
all he talks about over dinner is knee surgery, if he thinks this is the
most entrancing activity in the world, you'll probably think he's
"different." And I'll call him when my knee acts up.
</p><p>
As for dissing our elders, I'd rather acknowledge our debt to them for
the good and bad examples they set for us, for the learning experience we
all gained. But it would be dangerously dishonest if we kidded ourselves
and didn't acknowledge a sense of rivalry as well. Age-old mixed feelings.
</p><p>
Does this tell the whole story? Certainly not. Group dynamics, human
frailties and virtues, ironic luck are just as important as my limited
view of what moves us. And, in the end, we'd like our product to do the
talking for us. For that, we still have a lot to do.

AKA: Looking for an installer<br />
AKA: FORTH? Bah! Lisp is Cool!
</h5></div></div></div><p>
What's a good language/environment for a scriptable installer? Some
suggestions: FORTH, Java, Perl, Lisp (the world's only civilized
computer language). Java was generally accepted as the most generally
acceptable, although not without some specific objections.
</p><p>
Language aside, should the script that drives the installer be binary
or human readable? Some folks would like to read the script before
running it; there's some feeling that a binary could be a Trojan horse.
This was countered by the reminder that the application that's being
installed is itself binary—why trust the app but distrust the
installer?
</p><p>
The desirability of embedded installers was also debated. Fred Fish:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I would prefer there be one installer application [and interpreter]
that lives somewhere on the system...[A] package being distributed
[should] include only the installer script...</span>”
</p><p>
But according to Michael Bayne:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If I am going to distribute an application ...I have to *guarantee*
that the user can install it. Short of an installer provided by Be,
there is no other way to guarantee the existence of such a program
without bundling it. Nothing less than a 100% guarantee will suffice.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id553339"></a>Subject: FS block size problem?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is the file system block size (in DR9) tied to the size of the hard
disk? Is there a performance hit for small block sizes? How much disk
space is eaten for overhead?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: File system block size is tunable (per system): 512K to
8K. As for the performance of various sizes of blocks, it depends on
what you're doing. If you're streaming huge amounts of data from disk,
then big blocks are better. But remember, speed isn't always everything
--big blocks waste space if you have a lot of little files.
</p><p>
Dominic Giampaolo offered this testimonial regarding overhead:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I just created a file system on a 4 gig disk and there is about 1
megabyte used for the initial data structures laid down on the disk
(i.e. you have 4 gig minus 1 meg available for user data).</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id553378"></a>Subject: Mouse focus feature request declined?</h4></div></div></div><p>
UI discussion: Should focus follow the mouse? Is auto-raise (where the
window under the cursor comes to the front) evil? Is the inability to
type in a nonraised window lamentable? How about some window-management
tools?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id553393"></a>Subject: Main Menu</h4></div></div></div><p>
In this thread, which sprouted from the side of "Mouse focus...," Talin
offered a number of interesting UI "studies show" thoughts:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Menus are more efficient when the mouse pointer is constrained. The
simplest example is having the menu bar at the top of the screen—you
can 'slam' the mouse pointer against the top of the screen without
having to gauge the distance that you are traveling.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Studies have shown that the time it takes to hit a target with a mouse
increases with the distance of mouse travel and decreases with the size
of the target. Constraining the mouse increases the effective target
area.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Another innovative menu structure is that of 'radial menus.' These are
pop-up menus that display menus arranged radially around the current
mouse position. It turns out that people are _much_ better at
remembering angles than they are at remembering distances.</span>”
</p><p>
Most of these points were granted by our listeners—but some folks
questioned the basic premise: Is the mouse really such a great input
device? Can a user move faster and with greater accuracy by using
keyboard equivalents?
</p><p>
We heard (and debated) the results of some homegrown experiments.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id553453"></a>Subject: One more thing... [DR9]</h4></div></div></div><p>
An initial request for distinct icons for individual files led to a
discussion of the DR9 MIME type implementation and use. In addition to
file extension-to-MIME mapping, some folks would like the system to map
from UNIX-style magic numbers, regexp hits, and so on. This could, it

Adam Hinkley wrote in to testify his dissatisfaction with
flow-controlled data-sending functions that packetize the input buffer;
he finds that this leads to partial data transmission. His solution:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">[H]ave a function that returns how much data in the internal buffers
has not yet been sent. [T]he app can watch how much data is waiting to
be sent, and when it drops below, say 500K, call the Send function to
queue up some more data.</span>”
</p><p>
It was suggested that this sort of mechanism is better left to
individual programs (and a code example that loops over send() was
given)—it shouldn't be a default mode of the system. Mr. Hinkley
countered that the synchronous send() is wasteful—you could be doing
something better with your time than waiting for send() to return. But
some feel blocking send() is a good thing because it consumes less CPU
than does a busy-wait (or poll). If you want to do something else while
waiting, you can...

“<span class="quote">...spawn a child thread. That's what they exist for.</span>” [Osma Ahvenlampi]
</p><p>
Mr. Hinkley offered a (real world) example in which a server is talking
to a large number of clients (he proposed 100). If you spawn a thread
for each connection, you'll kill the system. Not so, responded many
listeners: 100+ threads in the BeOS is hardly unusual.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We won't force anyone to use threads.
