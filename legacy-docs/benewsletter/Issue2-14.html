Of all execution environments, I find that of the device driver the most
challenging. Hardware interrupts can cause guileless code to run in an
unexpected order and variables to acquire contradictory values. In the
case of the BeOS, concurrently running threads may join the fray, adding
to the confusion. Meanwhile, the hardware must be stroked in complicated,
often undocumented ways, while threads from user space clamor for
attention.
</p><p>
It is through the synchronization services of the Kernel Kit and
additional kernel calls that order and execution ordering are achieved.
However, the utmost programmer care is required, for a few reasons.
Firstly, the human mind deals poorly with parallel operations. Secondly,
the consequences of logical error are difficult to debug. Thirdly, driver
writers do not enjoy a luxurious development environment. And finally,
many problems at this level are timing-dependent.
</p><p>
This article is itself a victim of a synchronization error. I was unaware
that my good friend, Benoît Schillings, was writing an article titled
"Fun with Semaphores." Having discovered this just today, and having
already started my article, it is too late to set a semaphore around the
topic! I pray for a minimum of contradictions.
</p><p>
The essence of synchronization is wasting time: If you can't do something
now, wait for a change in conditions, then try again. The two facilities
for this purpose are semaphores and spinlocks. Both are described in The
Be Book, in "The Kernel Kit" and "The Device Kit" chapters, respectively.
Semaphores may block the current thread, meaning the CPU becomes
available for other work. Spinlocks will simply burn CPU time on the spot.
</p><p>
If burning CPU time sounds bad, it is. The reason for using spinlocks is
connected with hardware interrupts: The resulting flow of control through
the interrupt handler code must not block. This rules out the acquisition
of semaphores (releasing them is fine). Therefore, use spinlocks only
where interrupts are involved, and only for the shortest time possible.
</p><p>
As synchronization primitives, semaphore and spinlock functions are
rarely sufficient on their own. Rather, they are combined with data
structures and with each other to provide higher-level services for the
driver's particular needs.
</p><p>
The remainder of this article explores examples of increasing complexity.
The code does not represent a complete driver, and some knowledge of
driver structure is assumed: Please refer to "Developing a
Kernel-Loadable Driver" in "The Device Kit" chapter of The Be Book for
further background. Some declarations and prudent error checking have
been omitted for brevity. When studying the code, remember that there are
multiple flows of control contending for service: One that originates
from the hardware interrupt system and a few from user mode.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id556065"></a>Example: Counter</h3></div></div></div><p>
In this first example, user-mode threads enter the driver and block until
the next device event. There is no race condition, because an event
occurring earlier simply allows the <code class="function">acquire_sem</code> to return immediately.
The semaphore, in effect, "counts" the number of events, while also
synchronizing the threads. The events are not duplicated for each thread,
but are dealt like playing cards from a deck.

</pre><p>
The interrupt handler may not acquire semaphores, since that would risk
blocking. Releasing semaphores will never block but may cause the
rescheduling of threads, including the interrupt flow of control itself.
The handler must avoid this possibility by deferring all scheduling
activity, using the <code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> flag.

This example resembles the previous one, except the device event is
augmented by a piece of data. Note that interrupt- level and background
both access the circular buffer, but not the buffer indices. The counting
semaphore continues to directly synchronize producer and consumer, as
they access the event buffer. The presence of multiple consumers,
however, requires that the "tail" index be protected before use. Code
that uses "tail" must lie within a "critical region": a section of code
bracketed by a "locking" semaphore. The locking semaphore is created with
an initial count of 1.

Why does the counting semaphore, csem, fail to protect the tail index?
Imagine two consumers blocked at the start of <code class="function">dev_read</code>: If two events
arrive simultaneously, both background threads will launch into the
critical region.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id556396"></a>Example: Critical Regions With Interrupt</h3></div></div></div><p>
This example resembles the previous one, in that data is incoming.
However, the circular buffer has been replaced with a dynamically
expandable linked list. Suddenly, interrupt-level and background cannot
safely access the data structures concurrently: All data access must be
placed in a "critical region." Since interrupts are involved, a spinlock
is employed instead of <code class="varname">lsem</code>.
</p><p>
Spinlocks must be used in conjunction with the interrupt- disabling
facilities of the BeOS. The following scenario illustrates the reason why:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Background thread on CPU A acquires spinlock S
</p></li><li><p>
Device interrupts A
</p></li><li><p>
Interrupt handler running on A acquires spinlock S
</p></li><li><p>
CPU A is deadlocked

There are two sections of code, belonging to the same critical region:
They are locked by the same spinlock. Shared variables must only be
accessed within a critical region. The critical region is bracketed by
calls to <code class="function">lock()</code> and <code class="function">unlock()</code>. Packaging the synchronization activity as
isolated function calls is highly desirable as the complexity of the
driver increases.
</p><p>
It would be an error to place all of <code class="function">dev_read()</code> in the critical region,
that is, to call <code class="function">lock()</code> before <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code>. If ten background threads
entered the driver, one would block on csem, while the other nine would
spin. Even worse, the interrupt handler would spin—game over. The
general rule: No blocking within a spinlock-critical region.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id556839"></a>Example: BYOB (Bring Your Own Blockable)</h3></div></div></div><p>
In this final example the counting semaphore, csem, has been retired,
replaced by the "z" facility. This facility permits data consumption in
smorgasbord fashion: Data can be removed in any order, and in any amount.
Data can even be added by the consumer, restaurant rules permitting. "z"
relies on <code class="function">lock()</code>/<code class="function">unlock()</code>,
while allocating more semaphores for internal
use.
</p><p>
For background threads, each service (<code class="constant">GET_LINE</code>, <code class="constant">FLUSH_ON_NULL</code>,
<code class="constant">WAIT_FOR_MORE</code>, <code class="constant">WAIT_UNTIL_EMPTY</code>) has its own independent agenda and
possible side effects. In spite of the free-wheeling, new services can be
added easily. Code correctness is maximized by isolating the tricky
synchronization and providing simple rules.
</p><p>
Rule 1: All code that accesses the driver's common data (linked list,
total) must be bracketed with <code class="function">lock()</code> and <code class="function">unlock()</code>.
</p><p>
Rule 2: All code that changes common data must call <code class="function">zalert()</code>.
</p><p>
Rule 3: Any critical-region background code can call <code class="function">zwait()</code> to wait for
changes to common data.

The trickiest part of this code is in <code class="function">zwait()</code>, where the background
thread blocks on its newly created semaphore. Since the thread controls
the critical region, simply blocking would generate a deadlock situation:
The thread is preventing the very changes it desires. Therefore, it must
exit the critical region first. Before returning, <code class="function">zwait()</code> regains the
critical region. This call is not available for interrupts, of course.
</p><p>
For readers of this article who are still standing, the z facility can be
improved to use just one semaphore, instead of the whole array. This
exercise requires fanatical attention to race conditions. Those who can
craft it should consider a career in operating systems.

The examples presented should make clear the difficulty of writing
synchronization code (at least, code that works). Beyond trivial cases,
the driver writer should segregate such code from device operations. A
service of greater sophistication can be constructed from the semaphore,
spinlock, and interrupt primitives by combining them with appropriate
data structures.

Saturday night, minutes away from midnight, I'm struck with a thought as
my plane races down the Sierras bringing me home from the latest Be Demo
Tour. I'm a vampire. Yes, really, and no, not the traditional "bite you
on the neck" kind. Have a seat. Oh, I see you're already seated. I'll
explain.
</p><p>
A traditional vampire requires fresh blood in order to sustain itself. I
have seen some strange rituals during and after Be demos, but nothing
involving blood yet. Anyway, I feed off something different. I require
fresh and raw enthusiasm. I'm afraid that unlike the traditional
vampire's needs, just having a warm body in the room is not adequate for
my needs. So, I turn down the lights, just to get the right atmosphere,
and I begin to prepare my meal with a little seasoning. Finding all the
filenames containing an 'e' that are larger than 50 K nearly instantly on
a 2 GB disk with more than 2,000 items draws a few gasps from the real
geeks in the crowd.
</p><p>
Appetizers have been served!
</p><p>
Giving people their first taste for the responsiveness of the BeOS by
playing a 16-bit stereo audio file at 44.1 KHz while moving a
30-frames-per-second QuickTime/Cinepak movie around the screen with no
loss of smoothness or skipped frames gives me my first course. By this
point, it's easy to tell there's going to be a feast.
</p><p>
I think the engineers here at Be are on to me though. I think they
realize what feeds an Evangelist, so they keep building better bait.
Maybe the live queries won't draw you out. Perhaps eight
QuickTime/Cinepak movies playing at the same time is "oh so ho-hum." But
the 3D rendered book in which you can smoothly flip pages (the faster you
move the mouse, the more the page warps) might just do it. Do I have to
tease you by putting a couple of static images on the pages and flipping
those back and forth? Fine, because if you're at all interested now, I'll
catch you completely by throwing down a couple of movies on another two
pages and flipping these back and forth as the movies continue to play
while being mapped to the available surfaces of the pages. Just to be
safe, let's bring up a rendered sphere and throw a movie on that. Hey,
mop up that sauce with another image and another movie on both sides of a
rendered wave. Someone pass me the wine, please.
</p><p>
Everyday life at Be is a fun and irreverent existence. Getting to eat
lunch with Jean-Louis and the rest of the Be team nearly all the time is
an eye-opening insight into the history of an industry. I definitely miss
it while I'm away on Demo Tours—but I need more. I need to know
firsthand that people are excited about the work we're doing. Having a
couple hundred people show up for a Demo Tour meeting is just the
beginning. Showing them an application crash into the debugger with no
effect on the other four applications that are running (protected memory)
is just the beginning. Showing them a few movies playing, a couple of
sounds tracks layered over one another, a rendered three-dimensional cube
rotating while painting its sides with static images, movies, and even a
couple live video feeds on the other sides, this is still just the
beginning. Did I say I was doing this all at the same time. Well I am and
I do. Having the crowd murmur, gasp, applaud, and stand up cheering; now
that's meat an Evangelist can sink his teeth into.
</p><p>
Do vampires eat dessert? I know I rarely pass up on this all-important
dining pleasure, so I include it in my demos as well. I finish up with a
foray into the Macintosh OS via the VirtualMac, which allows you to run
Macintosh applications in a BeOS window. Like most people, I remember my
favorite dessert. While not on a Demo Tour, it was during a demo at
Macworld this past January. Showing VirtualMac for the first time it was
remarkably stable, so imagine my surprise when Word 6.0 crashed the Mac
OS. I paused briefly. The crowd suddenly became intensely interested. I
closed the window, relaunched the VirtualMac without any problems, and
when the Mac OS had booted, it brought up a dialog box that said, "This
computer may not have been shut down properly the last time it was used."
The crowd broke out in laughter while I dabbed at my lips with a napkin.
</p><p>
Coffee anyone? It's nice to sip from some of our third-party
applications, so I always end by showing off a few of the native BeOS
applications that are available. BeatWare's ReggaeWrite shows what an
everyday productivity application such as a word processor gets from
running on a modern OS. Hey, let's watch as I move a picture around in my
document and the text is flowed throughout all 700 pages in a separate
thread. Then there's the Sum-It spreadsheet, which handles all it's
calculations in separate threads and is rock solid. *Slurp* Oops, excuse
me. Sometime I get carried away.
</p><p>
"What about garlic and coffins?" you might ask. Well, no, I think the
garlic thing is a myth, since I eat as much of it as I can. As far as
coffins go, after spending as many nights in hotels and motels as I have,
I can think of no better description.
</p><p>
I'm also starting to get suspicious of our engineers. Vampires don't like
the light, and the Be engineers are spending a lot of late-night hours
here in the office. I'm expecting some killer new bait pretty soon.
</p><p>
Well, thanks for joining me for my meal. If you've been one of my
victims, don't worry. The only side effect is an insatiable desire to get
your hands on a copy of the BeOS.

Spring is in the air as well as in my step. Springtime is neat. The air
is crisp and clear, flowers are in bloom, winter's chill is past. You
feel warm and excited, like you can conquer the world. I guess it's like
this for us in the computer industry. Whenever a new OS or something or
other comes along, we get all excited as if it's the coming of spring and
all our ambitions will be fulfilled.
</p><p>
As you go to the garage to clean it out, as you fix up the house, you
realize that it's a lot of work... too much work. Sometimes this leads to
discouragement, and you find yourself on the couch watching the monster
truck pull instead. But, if you make it past this stage, you call up a
couple of friends to enlist their help.
</p><p>
So too with creating a new operating system. Introducing something new
into the world of computing is a daunting task—especially for a
company of only 50 people. But fortunately we're not alone. There are
many developers out there in the world producing applications for the
BeOS. Some are freeware or shareware, others are serious commercial
offerings. We say this over and over, but there's nothing like a
shovelware CD to prove the point. The folks at Adamation have come out
with their Be Specific Series II disc.
</p><p>
http://www.bespecific.com
</p><p>
Chock full of all the software from the Be ftp site, the BeDevTalk
mailing list, and the comp.sys.be.* newsgroups. Quite a resource for the
Be aficionado. If you want to play with a lot of BeOS software but don't
want to spend the time downloading it all, this might be the thing for
you.
</p><p>
When you have limited resources such as we do at Be, you rely more
heavily on community building. A few weeks ago I put out some simple code
for an MPEG-I decoder. I admitted that it wasn't the best decoder in the
world, but it was enough to get people going. Soon thereafter, a couple
of different developers released code for MPEG Audio decoders.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/audio/maplay.zip<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/audio/maplay12_be01.zip
</p><p>
These are ports of a well-known MPEG audio player, and they work quite
nicely. If you're interested in MPEG, you can also find:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/audio/Mpeg026.tar.gz<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/viewers/BEMPEG.tar.gz<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/viewers/mpeg.tar.gz<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/viewers/mpeg2codec.tar.gz<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/viewers/mpeg_util.tar.gz<br />
</p><p>
Boy, if there were only a Datatypes handler for MPEG, we'd be all set.
One could only hope that we gain similar support for some of the more
obscure video formats as well.
</p><p>
And if that's not enough, we now have BeTV:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/viewers/BeTV_0.3.tar.gz
</p><p>
Kevin Hendrickson at it with the Hauppauge tuner digitizer board again.
Change the channels, use cable/air/composite, play with the parameters
for best viewing. We're seeing more and more community-built software all
the time.
</p><p>
Spring is in the air and we're in the midst of a barn raising. With the
help of our developer community, we should have it up in time to protect
us from the rains of Fall, and the Summer heat.

...is a dangerous sport. I'm not referring to Bill or his aides making
noises about your misusing his words; by now, Bill has grown used to the
fact his words are going to be used and abused and it doesn't seem to
affect his spiritual or financial well-being. No, quoting Chairman Bill
gets you in two kinds of trouble, instead: Flames and obsolescence. You
get burned at the stake for blasphemy or, worse, you're out of step, you
didn't move fast enough, you're zigging while the Chairman is already in
full zag. The more celebrated, and still fresh example is Microsoft's
successive turns to the Internet.
</p><p>
We start with MSN, an on-line service in the AOL or CompuServe model
(soon to be one, we're told). This was less than two years ago. Microsoft
is creating an unfair advantage by bundling its on-line service with
Windows 95! Never mind, come December '95, on the anniversary of Pearl
Harbor, Bill Gates quoted Admiral Yamamoto, telling the world Netscape
had awakened the giant. The Internet is everywhere. Therefore, no need
for a division, it would be like having an electricity division. Three
months later, like Athena, a new Internet division springs, fully armed,
from the head of Microsoft. Admirable. No need to belabor the lessons of
that one. Sometimes, I think the leadership and cultural strength
demonstrated by Microsoft can only be emulated in part. The rest is in
some set of genes. Like low cholesterol, good eating habits and exercise
help a bit, but the surest recipe is picking your parents well.
</p><p>
A little more recently, Microsoft gave further proof of their flexibility
and focus. Time will tell if it contains knowledge useable by lesser
mortals. This is about the NC. In the old IBM fashion, it started with
the usual: “<span class="quote">It's nothing, you don't need it.</span>” Then, as the pressure
mounted, the NetPC and the Zero Administration Initiative came out. This
was seen by many as an old-fashioned paper tiger. Good, hygienic, but not
an NC. Awright. Citrix, under a license from Microsoft, had been selling
a kind of NC product. From a dumb terminal, you run ordinary Windows
applications: Lotus Notes (just kidding), Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and
the like. The applications run on a Windows NT server and WinFrame, the
Citrix product, does the rest. Microsoft got into negotiations with
Citrix to acquire the WinFrame core technology. The talks apparently
broke down around the end of February, with Microsoft stating it had a
team developing similar technology. And last week, at SD '97, Bill Gates
announced support in Windows NT 5.0 for a Windows "frozen" terminal. You
buy it, you don't modify it, you keep it several years, and then you
throw it away, because the technology has made it sufficiently obsolete.
It offers the cost of ownership benefits of the NC, the control you want
to regain, and the applications you're comfortable with. Admirable again.
Now the NC has real competition.
</p><p>
The discussion will shift to technical and business arguments, away from
religious ones. One can hope. Not that I'm such a Microsoft groupie, but
I don't think a technology ought to be embraced, a product ought to be
purchased, because it's "not Microsoft." It's religious and we know who
gains the most from religion. Not the faithful. But the week had yet to
be capped by the purchase of WebTV. Imagine a set-top box (I know, WebTV
isn't exactly one, yet) running Windows CE. The home NC. Windows
everywhere, on the server, on the desktop, in your pocket, and now, on
your TV. Sony and Philips are now Microsoft licensees. Perhaps not what
they had in mind.
</p><p>
Java started as a set-top-box language, but transmuted itself into a
renaissance movement to create a new world of platform-independent
applications, NCs, and, more to the point, a way to shake Microsoft's
hold on the industry. And we end up back on top of the TV set.
</p><p>
Speaking of Java, I can't resist the pleasure of quoting Bill Gates in a
message to Dave Winer (dwiner@well.com, http://www.scripting.com/).
</p><p>
Dave writes great software and a great newsletter, filled with discerning
observations on our industry.
</p><p>
Here's some of what Bill Gates (billg@microsoft.com), is thinking about
on a Saturday morning:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">When Microsoft wanted to do Java, Sun told us we had to help fund
JavaSoft in a big way and do a lot of other things, so we did what they
asked. When Sun wanted to clone Windows they didn't call us or pay us or
anything. Which is open Java or Windows?</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Why are they trying to create a religion with purity concepts? Is native
code compilation so bad? Is being able to call a platform a bad thing?
Most languages can call the database libraries, multimedia libraries,
graphics and text libraries that have already been created. They are
insisting everything be rebuilt.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Imagine a pure application running on the Macintosh—no clipboard
calls. No desktop integration. No scripting support. People rejected
every application on the Mac that didn't exploit the platform. Now this
is being demanded as part of the Java religion. Is this driven by what
users want or what an industry insider wants?</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Microsoft embraces Java as one of the languages that people will develop
in—in fact we brought good debugging to Java and we have the best
performance VM. Our AFC libraries give people graphics and UI richness.
So we are one of the companies involved in Java but we think C, Visual
Basic and other languages will still be of great importance. We have an
advance in our object model we will show next month that allows all
languages to work together with some big benefits.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">As long as we are talking about Java, another important thing to
disclose to people is that 16-bit machines (the 60 million computers
running Windows 3.1) will never have usable Java performance. Netscape
never went final with their 16-bit VM. Sun didn't even do one. Netscape
claims they will do one with Communicator but Communicator won't fit on
90% of 16-bit PCs. Our Caffeine marks were tripled recently from 13 to 41
but it's too slow to be usable. We are over 1000 on Win32.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">All languages are independent of hardware assuming you have the right
code generator. Most applications require operating system services
whether it's a duplicate operating system on top of the main one or the
primary OS on the machine.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Of 6 emails I sent early on a Saturday morning I have already had
responses to 4 of them. You, Esther Dyson and 2 Microsoft people. It's
kind of crazy how much people are available on email but it's very nice.</span>”
</p><p>
Interesting comments on languages and platform independence.
