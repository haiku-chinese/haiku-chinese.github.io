What the heck is this guy talking about? Well, if you've ever transported
data between little-endian (for example, x86) and big-endian (for
example, PPC) processors, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Processor designers make choices when deciding how data will be stored,
and compiler writers add some of their own twists. It's likely that data
written on one platform can't be read correctly on another. If you're
aware of this and take some precautionary steps, you'll be safe when it
comes time to read your data on some other platform besides a PowerPC
version of the BeOS.
</p><p>
If you're writing a network application, pay attention. Even if you're
merely saving data to a file, you're unwittingly writing a network
application. Files are easily transported across a network and often read
in the future by applications on other platforms.
</p><p>
First, some background. Most programmers are familiar with the byte-order
differences among processors. If you aren't, consider this code:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">int</span>  <code class="varname">i</code> = 0x01020304;
<span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">c</code> = (<span class="type">char *</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">i</code>;
<code class="function">printf</code>("%02x %02x %02x %02x—%02x %02x %02x %02x\n",
    <code class="varname">c</code>[0], <code class="varname">c</code>[1], <code class="varname">c</code>[2], <code class="varname">c</code>[3],
    <code class="varname">c</code>[3], <code class="varname">c</code>[2], <code class="varname">c</code>[1], <code class="varname">c</code>[0]);
</pre><p>
On a little-endian processor, such as the x86 (or Pentium), the output is:
</p><pre class="screen">
04 03 02 01—01 02 03 04
</pre><p>
On a big-endian processor, such as the PowerPC (in the mode that the BeOS
uses) you get:
</p><pre class="screen">
01 02 03 04—04 03 02 01
</pre><p>
Little-endian means that the first byte contains the least significant 8
bits. Big-endian means that the first byte contains the most significant
8 bits. If you've never seen little-endian machines in action, you might
think they're doing things backwards. But they're no more backwards than
driving in Britain is backwards or the flushing of toilets in the
southern hemisphere is backwards. It's just different, and takes a little
getting used to if you aren't already familiar with it. The PowerPC can
actually run either little-endian or big-endian. Be chose the big-endian
mode for the BeOS (Windows NT uses the little-endian mode).
</p><p>
16-bit integers (shorts) and 64-bit integers (long longs, available with
some compilers) are treated by processors in an analogous manner. In
other words, the big-endian and little-endian versions are simply
byte-for-byte mirror images of each other. Floats and doubles are treated
as if they were 32-bit or 64-bit integers, with respect to endian- ness
issues. Bitfields are generally not portable, and should be avoided when
writing data externally. Of course, ANSI C says nothing about what sizes
the various types are, and they can vary from platform to platform. The
sizes I've assumed here for the various C and C++ types are the ones that
are used on most modern platforms, including the PowerPC versions of the
BeOS. However, to be safe, it's better to use typedefs than the built-in
C++ data types to force data items to be a given size on all platforms.
In DR9, Be will provide typedefs like "int32" to make this job easier.
</p><p>
Now, some more background, this time having to do with alignment. Many
processors can't read a data item from just any location in memory, but
require it to be "aligned." For example, the following code WON'T work on
a PowerPC processor:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">c</code> = <code class="function">malloc</code>(9);
<span class="type">double *</span><code class="varname">d</code> = (<span class="type">double *</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">c</code>[1];

*<code class="varname">d</code> = 0;  <span class="comment">/* causes an exception on ppc */</span>
</pre><p>
That's because malloc will return a pointer that's "aligned" on an 8-byte
boundary (the pointer is a multiple of 8), and the code is attempting to
dereference a double on an odd boundary (not a multiple of 8). That same
code, however, WILL work on an x86 processor (though it will run faster
on the x86 if you align it).
</p><p>
Because of this, compiler writers usually lay out your data in a fashion
that will both work with the processor and perform well. Some compilers
have flags to "pack" data, so the data structures are smaller at the
expense of running slower. Hence the rules for alignment vary from
machine to machine, even on the same machine with the same compiler (but
different compiler flags).
</p><p>
OK, I hope now you understand the magnitude of the problem. What's the
solution, you ask? For alignment, the answer's quite simple. The concept
of "natural alignment" means you lay out data in a way that's "natural"
for the size of the type. Shorts should be aligned on 2-byte boundaries,
integers and floats on 4-byte boundaries, and long longs and doubles on
8-byte boundaries. This works for all processors and compilers. For
example, consider this very unportable structure:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct {
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c0</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">d</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c1</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c3</code>;
  <span class="type">short</span> <code class="varname">s</code>;
} <code class="varname">foo</code>;
</pre><p>
This structure and its elements will be aligned all kinds of different
ways with different processors and compilers. The compiler will insert
padding into the structure as necessary to cause it to be aligned on the
target processor.
</p><p>
Without reordering the data elements, you can force natural alignment by
inserting your own padding into the structure:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct {
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c0</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">_pad0</code>[7];    <span class="comment">// align to 8-byte boundary</span>
  <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">d</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c1</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">_pad1</code>[3];    <span class="comment">// align to 4-byte boundary</span>
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c2</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">_pad2</code>;      <span class="comment">// align to 2-byte boundary</span>
  <span class="type">short</span> <code class="varname">s</code>;
} <code class="varname">foo</code>;
</pre><p>
Of course, if you reorder things you can get a more efficient structure
without sacrificing natural alignment:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct {
  <span class="type">short</span> <code class="varname">s</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">__pad</code>[2];    <span class="comment">// force to 4-byte boundary</span>
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">d</code>;      <span class="comment">// already at 8-byte boundary</span>
} <code class="varname">foo</code>;
</pre><p>
With natural alignment the alignment of a structure, versus a scalar,
should be the same as the alignment of the most restrictive element it
contains. For example, consider this structure:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct {
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c0</code>;
  struct {
    <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">d</code>;
  } <code class="varname">s</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c1</code>;
} <code class="varname">foo</code>;
</pre><p>
The most restrictive element is the double, so both structures <code class="varname">foo</code>.<code class="varname">s</code> and
<code class="varname">foo</code> itself should be aligned on double boundaries. To make this data
portable, massage it as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
struct {
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c0</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">_pad0</code>[7]; <span class="comment">// pad out to double boundary</span>
  struct {
    <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">d</code>;
  } <code class="varname">s</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">c</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span> <code class="varname">_pad1</code>[7]; <span class="comment">// pad out to double boundary</span>
} <code class="varname">foo</code>;
</pre><p>
If the most restrictive element were an integer, rather than a double,
then you'd only need 3 padding bytes instead of 7. Notice the padding at
the end of the structure. Another rule of natural alignment is that
structures should be sized to by a multiple of their most restrictive
element.
</p><p>
The last thing I want to say about natural alignment is that there's no
"natural" alignment for pointers, since pointers can vary in size.
They're 32 bits on PowerPC and Intel processors, but on a DEC Alpha
they're 64 bits. It doesn't make any sense to transport a pointer to
another machine anyway, but you might think you can get away with it if
you only use the value internally to your application. You can't, so
leave the pointers out please. You'll be thankful when it comes time to
read the data back on a 64-bit machine.
</p><p>
OK, so that does it for alignment. The harder problem is dealing with
endian-ness. There are several techniques. The simplest way is to just
set a bit somewhere indicating what byte-order (little-endian or
big-endian) your data was written out in. Then when you read the data
back, you simply check the bit to see if it matches the endian-ness of
your current environment. If it matches, you do nothing. If it doesn't,
then you swap. However, if you haven't written your little-endian
application yet, then you can delay writing the swapping code. Just put a
panic statement in there as a placeholder to remind you when you finally
do port your application. If you want to write the swapping code now, you
can take advantage of some handy routines that Be provides:
<code class="function">read_16_swap()</code>, <code class="function">write_16_swap()</code>,
<code class="function">read_32_swap()</code>, <code class="function">write_32_swap()</code>. The
<code class="function">read_64_swap()</code> and <code class="function">write_64_swap()</code>
routines are left as an exercise for
the reader (hee, hee). Consult the on-line documentation for more
information about the swapping functions.
</p><p>
Another way to deal with endian-ness is to always encode things in some
canonical format (usually big-endian). This isn't an ideal way to do
things, because machines with the same byte-order communicating with each
other will swap things unnecessarily with some loss (usually very
minimal) in performance. If you want to use this technique, you can use
the Berkeley networking functions <code class="function">htons()</code>, <code class="function">htonl()</code>,
<code class="function">ntohs()</code>, and <code class="function">ntohl()</code>,
which convert shorts and longs back and forth between native order
("host" order) and big-endian order ("network" order). On big-endian
platforms, such as the BeOS, the functions do nothing; on little-endian
platforms, such as Windows NT, they swap the data. These functions are
available on any system with Berkeley sockets, and your code should be
portable to many platforms if you use them.
</p><p>
Along the same lines, Sun's XDR (External Data Representation) will
encode and decode your data to and from big-endian format, plus deal with
alignment issues. Using their stub compiler (rpcgen), it will even write
all of the XDR swapping code for you (really!). It isn't the most
efficient way to do things, but it does the job flawlessly and can keep
you from pulling your hair out if you're dealing with fairly complex
data. The package is free and widely available. For example, you can get
it in both source and binary form in many Linux distributions.
</p><p>
We here at Be feel your pain. We're working on some tools to make your
life easier with respect to machine differences. Look for them in the
coming months. Until then, you can use the information in this article.
!kcul dooG, er, I mean, good luck!

A couple of days ago, I stepped up to bat at Safeway, assumed my part as
the novice in the call and response (C: "hello" R: "hello" C: "how are
you tonight" R: "oh, OK" C: "that's good" R: ""), and then, rather than
continue this sham of an acquaintanceship, I avoided eye contact with the
checkeress and pretended to compute differential equations in my head. As
she pronounced my total, I noticed that she was eating an apple. (No,
wait. Let's make it some grapes.) Not her grapes—MY grapes, which I
was about to pay for. I gave her a look that requested an explanation;
she stopped a grape halfway to her open maw and held it up to better
gander at this bit of fruit that had, by weight of her expression, stuck
itself to her hand when she wasn't looking. Then she threw it below her
out of sight with a pitch of disgust that I couldn't help but take
personally. Not an endearing opening parry, but it broke the ice. Words,
not unfriendly, were spoken.
</p><p>
(By the way, why are grocery stores so proud of having drug- free
employees? Really—how much intelligence or presence of mind does it
take run a bar code over a scanner? Grocery checking isn't exactly a
going-somewhere career, the pay is lousy, and I can't imagine that anyone
with an ounce of self- respect actually WANTS to be declared employee of
the month, plum parking spot aside. We might as well let the poor
grubbers relieve the tedium a bit. It's almost civic-minded: If you're
going to get looped, better to be at the console of an NEC than behind
the wheel of a stolen BMW. Some savvy supermarket could even take up a
slogan of cynical goodwill: "Pik'N'Pay—Keeping the Stoners Off the
Street." I don't care, I want my clerks happy—as long as they don't
get hungry while they're ringing me up.)
</p><p>
Courtesies and histories were exchanged, and, half a conversation later,
when I told her I worked at Be, she began to ask about the new File
System API. The POSIX calls she knew; but the C++ API... she'd heard it
was screwy. So I explained the class layout to her satisfaction:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
There are two fundamental classes: <code class="classname">BEntry</code> and <code class="classname">BNode</code>.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> objects identify files, let you ask uber-questions about
them (what's your name, who's your parent), and let you manipulate
them within the file hierarchy (rename, move, remove). <code class="classname">BEntry</code> is
instantiable and has no subclasses.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="classname">BNode</code> class also represents files; its mission is to let you
read and write the data (and attributes) that the files contain.
<code class="classname">BNode</code> is abstract; descending from it are...
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BFile</code> (and on to <code class="classname">BResourceFile</code>),
<code class="classname">BDirectory</code>, and <code class="classname">BSymLink</code> (yes,
symbolic links are supported in DR9). In each case, the represented
file is opened when the object is created; destroy the object and the
file is closed. In this way, <code class="classname">BNode</code>s correspond to POSIX file
descriptors.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> and <code class="classname">BNode</code> both descend
from a class called <code class="classname">BStatable</code>, as in
"able to be <code class="function">stat()</code>'ed." <code class="classname">BStatable</code> is utterly abstract; it's simply a
cover for the POSIX stat structure and includes functions that get and
set the stat fields. Conceptually, it's cleaner to ignore <code class="classname">BStatable</code> as
a class and pretend that <code class="classname">BEntry</code> and <code class="classname">BNode</code>
have no ancestor. (<code class="classname">BStatable</code>
is actually a "mix-in": It defines a set of functions that each of the
"mixed in" classes—<code class="classname">BEntry</code> and <code class="classname">BNode</code>
in this case—is obliged to
implement. You never instantiate a <code class="classname">BStatable</code> object. Forget I mentioned
it.)
</p></li><li><p>
Over in the corner are <code class="classname">BVolume</code>, which should be obvious;
<code class="classname">BVolumeRoster</code>, a global list of currently mounted volumes;
and <code class="classname">BQuery</code>,
which you can use to search for files based on the values of their
attributes. Let's ignore these classes for now, as well.
</p></li></ul><p>
The screwiness that my grape girl complained of centered on the
<code class="classname">BEntry</code>/<code class="classname">BNode</code> duality—why have
two classes that "mean" the same thing
(that is, a file)? Because (I answered) in POSIX (from which all
blessings flow) a "file" can mean a "plain" file, a symbolic link, or a
directory.
</p><p>
Let's back up a little more: In DR9, a file (whether plain, link, or
directory) is uniquely and persistently identified by an "entry ref."
Entry refs are the common currency of file identification: If you want to
tell another app about a file, you pass it an entry ref. When the user
drops file icons on your app, the files show up in your app as a set of
entry refs.
</p><p>
Getting back to the duality business: Let's say someone has just dropped
an entry ref onto your app. You want to construct a <code class="classname">BFile</code>, or a <code class="classname">BSymLink</code>,
or a <code class="classname">BDirectory</code> object to represent the ref. But you can't tell, from the
ref itself, which class to instantiate. You have to create a <code class="classname">BEntry</code> and
ask the object (through <code class="classname">BStatable</code> functions, actually, but don't let's
start) what sort of file it is. You can then construct an object of the
appropriate <code class="classname">BNode</code> subclass.
</p><p>
Is this screwy? No screwier than <code class="function">stat()</code>'ing a pathname and then calling
one of <code class="function">open()</code>, <code class="function">readdir()</code>, or <code class="function">readlink()</code>.
</p><p>
Of course, this didn't tell the entire story, but my little checkerella
was starting to fog over, the folks behind me in line were starting to
smell, and, anyway, I had a wife waiting at home and two kids locked in
the trunk of my car (you can't be too careful). Having, in the meantime,
cantilevered my produce into a replica of the Brandenburg Gate, the bag
boy asked, "What'll it be, sir, POSIX or C++?"

As I sit here, late with my newsletter article, I have plenty of time to
contemplate the nature of the Universe, where Be is headed, and whether
or not Godzilla is real.
</p><p>
I want to make a couple of final offerings to appease the /boot/apps
gods. So this week we have the source for a couple of the final holdouts.
</p><p>
Font Demo: This one's been a staple of our demos for the past year. It
demonstrates our drawing speed and how to do a few UI type things. It's
not too exciting, but those who haven't delved very deeply into our font
code might find this useful.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/fontdemo.tgz
</p><p>
Font Chart: This one probably doesn't get much play, but it's equally
useful for those who are wanting to delve into the bowels of fontdom. You
can use Font Chart to select a font and display all its characters. It
also does some nice funky things with keyboard events.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/fontchart.tgz
</p><p>
With these two programs, this concludes our release of sample apps from
the /boot/apps directory. It's taken a few months and quite a few
newsletter articles, but everything that was fit for publishing has been
published.
</p><p>
These will also serve as the basis for conversion to DR9. That is, we'll
try to refer back to these source bases to give you a leg up on how to
get to DR9 when it's available.
</p><p>
Speaking of DR9, the offer of the porting lab is still open. So send in
your name to DevServices@be.com and express your interest in
participating in our porting lab. The date is still middle to late March,
which still isn't solid, but gives you an idea as to what our schedule is.
</p><p>
We should have a lot of fun during this porting process, and the end
result will be your products running on DR9 real soon. Again, you'll only
really want to participate if you're trying to ship an actual product
that's time critical with the release of DR9.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551145"></a>Communicating</h3></div></div></div><p>
When I first joined Be way back when, there was this BeDevTalk mailing
list, which the community used to communicate with each other and with
Be. The list at the time dumped 100 e-mail messages into my mailbox every
day. That's lot of mail to go through if you're on the receiving end.
Since that time I've had to take responsibility for mail coming to
DevSupport, DevServices, and CustSupport. Another 100 messages a day. Not
wanting to be a slave to my desk all day reading mail, we've hired
additional people to take care of some of this. Brian Mikol is a new hire
who's slowly learning the ropes and dealing with the DevServices and
CustSupport mail. Brian's a smart guy and will come up to speed rapidly
—then we'll dump more in his lap.
</p><p>
The BeDevTalk mailing list is still useful, and at times becomes quite
rancorous. There are now more avenues available to developers who want to
communicate with the Be community. The comp.sys.be news group has been
split into quite a few groups, including comp.sys.be.announce, advocacy,
programming, and the like. In order to lighten the load on BeDevTalk,
some people might find it convenient to direct their comments to one of
those public forums. It would be a tremendous boost to all developers if
the BeDevTalk list were limited to discussions that are technical in
nature, with a high signal to noise ratio. Advocacy, ranting, and other
list-bulging discussions can go elsewhere. This will help us remain
responsive to your true needs when they do arise from the list.
</p><p>
Also, there are a couple of efforts underway to index this mailing list
and provide searchable content through the Web. This should make this
list more approachable and useful to everyone.

DR9 is coming inevitably closer to completion and release. There's a lot
promised and hinted at in this release. Here at Be we try to underpromise
and overdeliver, but when there's a long time between releases, things
can get a bit hyped up. We hope that DR9 will live up to our publicly
stated promises, and maybe even offer some pleasant surprises. As it gets
closer, you might notice our engineers becoming more silent. When this
happens, don't fret, it's a sure sign that you're about to get a new
release.

It looks like Apple isn't so sure it likes the Mac clones anymore. This
is neither surprising nor innocuous. It could end up doing irreparable
harm to Apple and to the industry in general. Hopefully, Apple's recent
actions have been misunderstood, the concerns of Mac cloners are
overstated, and—to be positive and proactive—there's a profitable
and friendly way out of Apple's dilemma. We've heard about Apple
Australia's alleged saber-rattling at Apple dealers who also sell Mac
clones. The written document was promptly leaked to the media. We saw the
news of a seminar in Oregon touting the advantages of Apple's hardware
against the products of Power Computing, Motorola, UMAX, DayStar, and
others. The licensees paying money to Apple must find the idea
interesting. Perhaps they're planning a seminar across the street where
they'll extol their flexibility, price, marketing, or quality. Just
kidding, I think. We learned Apple doesn't intend to license PowerBook
designs, much to the chagrin of cloners and customers. We heard questions
regarding Apple's real commitment to deliver a CHRP version of the MacOS.
And there are rumors Apple will demand much higher license fees for the
new hardware designs, several hundred dollars we're told by several
sources. The alleged reason is the need to recoup hardware engineering
costs at Apple. Privately, Apple executives express irritation at the
clones' "cherrypicking" and claim Apple's making all the investment in
the platform and the cloners reap all the profit. Let's hope these are
false rumors or merely reflect a temporary loss of composure.
</p><p>
As for "cherrypicking," the cloners exhibit unpredictable behavior:
Looking for the highest profit. As for making all the effort and the
cloners making money out of Apple's investment, one thought that's what
licensing the platform was about. We sell you a license. We both expect
to make more money out of the deal than we put in. The cloner's margins
are supposed to more than pay for the fee. And Apple is supposed to make
real money out of the licensing business. Well, it seems that's where the
stated assumptions, or the implementation, went wrong.
</p><p>
Regarding the stated assumptions, Apple went into the licensing business
for reasons others than directly making money from it. At the time, a
little more than two years ago, Apple's management felt the Macintosh
platform needed more credibility. The Mac was labeled as proprietary, no
alternative source of supply, no competition. With Mac clones, the
reasoning went, software developers would invest more because the cloning
would grow the Mac ecological niche, and corporate purchasers would feel
better, safer, about Apple and the Macintosh. Then, as the cloners came
on line, Apple's business and credibility started suffering for reasons
unrelated to the presence of alternative sources of Power Mac hardware.
As a result, these successful players in the Mac niche only exacerbated
Apple's financial problems. Instead of a positive-sum game where everyone
benefited from a growing PowerPC industry segment, the sum of the game
now appears to be zero and the cloners' profits seem to be sucked from
Apple's income statement. "Seem" is the verb I just used because we don't
know. Where would the Power Mac segment be without the pioneering,
audacious marketing of Power Computing, without players like UMAX, MP
systems from DayStar, or the credibility of Motorola targeting business
users?
</p><p>
The temptation might be to return to the old days where Apple ruled
alone, or to increase licensing fees "as needed." The first would durably
damage Apple's credibility at a critical time. So would the latter, by
discouraging cloners.
</p><p>
Yet there's a way out of this situation, a way that would maintain a
healthy growing Mac-compatible segment and preserve Apple's freedom to
make both hardware and software for as long as their shareholders want
them to. Right now, a cloner must license both hardware and software.
That's the rub. Apple needs to let go of the hardware licensing business,
establish a basic hardware design, the equivalent of the PC/AT at the
core of all PC clones—let's call it the PPC/AT—and supply software
that runs on that platform—no ifs, no buts. I wrote supply, not give.
OEM licenses or shrink-wrap licenses are available at competitive rates.
Everyone's free to improve on that core. The cloners can add hardware
features and supply drivers. So can the mother ship. But each basic
release of the OS works on the standard PPC/AT implementation. No more
cherrypicking, no more trying to pass on the cost of hardware designs,
just software licensing fees and market forces.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there are several holes in this scenario. One is that
Apple could fear its inability to provide competitive designs, picturing
itself as overwhelmed by the cumulated energy and creativity of many
third-party designers extending the platform. The corollary hole is that
Apple could be tempted to design "private" features into the system
software only accessible by its own hardware design, thus protecting a
competitive advantage. From time to time, Microsoft is accused of doing
this in Windows for its applications. In any event, Apple's current
licensing program suffers from several genetic or structural defects.
Apple licensing was not born out of the desire to make money in and of
itself, and structural problems arise from the entanglement of hardware
and software in licensing discussions.
</p><p>
Appointing CHRP (or any other design) as the PPC/AT, letting everyone
build around it, and delivering, at last, a Mac OS version for CHRP, is
Apple's way to free its software licensing from hardware complications.
It will rekindle confidence and stimulate growth in the PowerPC industry.
This might even free Apple, in turn, to copy the Microsoft model and
build an immensely profitable application business on a thriving PPC
niche and a NeXT-based Mac OS. Apple shareholders might like that kind of
Microsoft cloning.

BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.
</p><p>

More requests:<br />
Open the system so new font engines can be added as add-ons. Implement
the alpha channel for alpha-defined anti-aliasing.
</p><p>
And discussion:<br />
How should font color be handled? Should color data be recognized, or
should fonts be defined as grayscale with alpha?
</p><p>
What about background color? A font engine that renders over a graphic
(or other nonuniform color) needs more info than simply a solid
background color.
</p><p>
Bitmap vs outline fonts:<br />
The demise of bitmap fonts (in DR9) was lamented by a few. How can
outline fonts look good in something like Terminal? Anti-aliasing and
outline-&gt;bitmap conversion were offered as possible solutions. The
pro-bitmap crowd felt that with all the good bitmaps that are currently
available, conversion is unnecessary and wasteful.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Sorry, but add-on font engines will not be supported in
DR9, nor will you be able to directly load bitmap fonts.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551313"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551320"></a>Subject: resolutions</h4></div></div></div><p>
Currently, Be defines screen sizes through a set of constants. But the
world seems to be moving to more flexible resolutions. It was suggested
that the constant-definition method be dropped in favor of an
x/y/depth/refresh-rate encoding within a 64-bit value. Implementations
and refinements were offered.
</p><p>
Relatedly, Chris Blackbourn asked for "screen quality" control in the
Game Kit:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">What I'd like is a Game Kit call that returns a screen of a certain
'speed.' Where speed=1.0 means 'gimme the fastest available screen
you've got,' and speed=0.0 means 'give me the highest resolution screen
you've got.'</span>”
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: An encoded resolution is a pretty good idea, and we're
looking at the implications. However, we can't promise anything for DR9.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551358"></a>Subject: High Bandwidth multimedia</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: What is Be's role?</h5></div></div></div><p>
What's the ideal system for real-time processing of wide data? Is the
BeOS it? And, more generally, what should be made of Be's espoused
emphasis on multimedia content creation?
</p><p>
Technically, the argument centered on bandwidth vs. dedicated
processing: Certain flavors of UNIX are great for pumping huge amounts
of data, but with invisible daemons and uncertain scheduling, latency
is hard to guarantee. "Not exactly so," said many UNIX supporters. They
felt that UNIX doesn't deserve the unfriendly scheduling reputation:
Many new flavors have emerged recently that CAN do real-time signal
processing. Tangentially, the thread moved into a discussion of what
constitutes UNIX.
</p><p>
On the philosophical side, a few listeners offered their
interpretations of (and offered suggestions for) Be's direction.
Eventually this discussion led back to analyses of Be's real-time
abilities.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id551387"></a>Subject: Time is running out!</h4></div></div></div><p>
Chris Herborth listed issues that need to be resolved before the BeOS
can be considered forward-compatible and encouraged others to
contribute. This turned into a general wish list as many of the
requests were not strictly needed for forward compatibility. Some
highlights:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
More binary formats and an Application Binary Interface spec
</p></li><li><p>
Internationalization
</p></li><li><p>
Driver registry
</p></li><li><p>
Clear data format definitions and assumptions
</p></li><li><p>
Language independence
</p></li><li><p>
Multi-user support and security
</p></li><li><p>
More and better bitmap (as in <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>) support
</p></li></ul><p>
The thread lurched into the perennial discussion of "how backwardly
compatible should an app be?"
</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="90%" valign="top"><p>
“<span class="quote">...do you use or know of anyone who uses a piece of software that has

</p></td><td width="5%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td width="100%" colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">—</td></tr></table></div><p>
A new, slightly cynical, twist was added to the argument: Software
