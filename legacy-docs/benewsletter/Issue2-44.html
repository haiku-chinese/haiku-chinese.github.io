When the elevator doors open, the first thing you notice is that no one
seems to be home. You wander into a maze of cubes, intent on finding your
elusive interviewer. Hard disk drives are stacked everywhere, like dirty
dishes, and interface cards are scattered around like promo literature at
a trade show. Computer systems are spilling their guts like dismembered
remains on a Quake battlefield. A small camera stares at a wristwatch.
You think to yourself, "I want some."
</p><p>
A few months later, deep in the driver dungeon, I'm surrounded by
hardware and documentation, hard disks and driver cards, with the innards
of several computers cluttering my desk. I've learned that sometimes
pointing the small camera at a wristwatch really is the best thing to do
with it.
</p><p>
While it's a lot of fun to get an Ultra Wide SCSI interface blasting over
14Mbytes/sec (with only a single drive), there are other tasks to
perform, like writing newsletter articles. The first challenge of
returning to the daylight world is using English, instead of C. The next
is, What to write about? Since I spend my time with the SCSI drivers and
kernel code, not with the bright and shiny APIs or application level
object-oriented, buzzword stuff, I'll try to shed some light on writing
device drivers.
</p><p>
SCSI device drivers! New Adapter card support for the BeOS! Have the
e-mails of thousands been heard? In a word, yes.
</p><p>
So, if you can't wait for the driver demons to settle into tested
configutations, if you want your new SCSI device driver in the BeOS
*now*, and if you're just about crazy enough to write one yourself, read
on.
</p><p>
The BeOS uses the CAM-SIM format for SCSI drivers, so before you write
anything, you need to start with the ANSI document X3T10/792D "SCSI-2
Common Access Method." You also need the basic SCSI info, and this is in
ANSI X3.131-1994 "Small Computer System Interface-2,"
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.symbios.com/x3t10/drafts.htm">http://www.symbios.com/x3t10/drafts.htm</a>. Your card will hopefully be a
PCI board, so you'll also need the PCI spec,
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/buses/types/pci.htm">http://www.pcguide.com/ref/mbsys/buses/types/pci.htm</a> (this is just an
overview, you might want to buy the full spec).
</p><p>
You'll also need complete hardware specs on the device you want to
support. This can be a pain, because not all manufacturers are
forthcoming about the details of their chips. For fear that a struggling
developer might discover some deep dark trade secret, they'll do their
best to hide critical information. They will make you sign papers, try to
entrap you with contracts on shrink wrap. But you must press on and never
lose hope, until the specs are yours.
</p><p>
Once you have the information you need, you'll be creating a loadable
driver called a SIM. The driver will be placed in the
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add_ons/kernel/cam</code> directory.
</p><p>
I can't give you enough information in a newsletter article to write a
real driver, but I can tell you how a SIM module is created for the BeOS.
I can give you insight into a few of the internals, and tempt you to read
all the other documentation I mentioned above (and what a geek feast this
stack of docs can be!).
</p><p>
Start with a function called <code class="function">sim_install()</code>. This is called during the
boot process to initialize the basics of the driver and register the SIM
with the XPT layer of the CAM driver (see the above-mentioned SCSI docs).
</p><p>
The BeOS does a lot of the PCI work for you. The bus is scanned early in
the boot process; you can obtain info about the devices with the function
<code class="function">get_nth_pci_info()</code>. This is called in a loop near the top of sim_install
to look at all the possible cards.
</p><p>
In this example I have a struc pointer called <code class="varname">pA</code> created to hold all the
details of my current adapter. Yours will be different.
</p><p>
Let's RTFS, OK?

If anyone has an inside track on some needed device, and wants more
detail on driver creation, send e-mail and I'll provide (some) support.
While we are limited in the amount in time we can give to support,
drivers are a high priority (especially on the Intel side).

(A creaking sound is heard as a trap door in the floor opens up. Tim
slowly walks down a cobweb-covered stairway, ducking to avoid the rusty
pipes and dangling wires. Off in the distance a dprintf is heard mumbling
about "hardware failures." The trap door closes with a thud.)

They say that the first 90% of development of an application might take 4
or 5 months but that the second 90% can take a year. So software that is
90% completed really has only a little more value than all that software
you never got started on in the first place. In the software business the
only thing that is really worth a darn is a completed product. In this
article I'll offer some suggestions for shortening the second 90% and
getting your application out the door to the customer.
</p><p>
I used to be in the videogame business, which can be very unforgiving.
It's driven by two CES's (Consumer Electrionics Shows) each year, plus
the Christmas season. You show your new videogame prototype at the
January CES. At the June CES you either show a second game or take orders
on the nearly completed first one. In late August or early September you
ship, because in the retail business that is Christmas. Period.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you become a realtor or sell cars or something, but you
don't get to be a game designer anymore. As a result of working under
this relentless schedule, I developed some techniques that helped me
finish and ship applications. These are more psychological than
technical, but I've found that they can play a big part of getting a
product out the door.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id599133"></a>Design one program at a time</h3></div></div></div><p>
One thing I notice as I survey Be's developer database is that a lot of
developers are SO excited about all the things the BeOS can do that they
are working on several projects at once! Inevitably, this divides their
concentration and attention. Bouncing between applications can take much
longer than doing them one at a time. Pick one and get it done.
</p><p>
Sometimes working on more than one project at a time is a way to keep
from getting bored. Let me suggest a better way: Concentrate on one
project, finish it, get some *money* from customers and use the *money*
to keep from getting bored.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id599158"></a>Stop designing your product and start debugging it</h3></div></div></div><p>
This suggestion violates some rules because it sounds like I'm telling
you to just wing it. But I've learned that it fits my style better to get
something up and running as soon as I can, and then use it, refine it and
debug it instead of continuing to design it. Once I start debugging and
finishing, I'm over the hump.
</p><p>
I know this is a psychological thing, but it has benefits that you don't
get when your app isn't up and running. In the first place you discover
things that don't work as well as you thought they would, and you have to
make changes. You learn which changes have to be made much sooner than if
you keep on designing for a long time. Also, in the debugging state
you're more resistant to adding features. Why do I think this is a good
thing? Read on.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id599186"></a>Take out all the unfinished features you are working on and ship it</h3></div></div></div><p>
Sure, lots of great features will be good for your customers. But your
program is not helping yor customers *at all* until it is in their hands.
This is a key point. You think you are doing the right thing by
perfecting your product and making it the greatest thing ever written.
But you aren't doing your customers *any* good if they don't have
something in their hands that they can use. So *ship it*! Perfection
works against you if it keeps you from delivering a usable product.
</p><p>
And remember, while you're working on several products, or trying to
perfect one, the competition is finishing *its* third-rate product! It
could wind up in the customer's hands instead of yours. Certainly theirs
isn't going to be as good as yours. And it's not going to have all those
great features you're still working on. But that's why *it* got *done*
and yours didn't. So beat the competition: Finish the thing and ship it.
Stop perfecting it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id599218"></a>Think a lot about version 2</h3></div></div></div><p>
No, I actually don't mean here to plan ahead and design your objects for
extensibility. Of course you want to do that. I mean every time you think
you want to add a feature or "improve" something, remember that there
will be a version 2 and you can add to that the glitzy features which are
hanging you up now. I know I'm repeating myself, but this is important
enough to say again: Stop adding stuff, stop improving it, limit it, and
get it out the door.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id599237"></a>The customer will tell you what to add, and then pay you for it!</h3></div></div></div><p>
Whether or not you perfect it now, in the end the customer is going to
tell you what to add—and you will often find out that you did a lot of
work for nothing. Get your product out to the customer fast so you can
hear about what should be in the next version, instead of deciding for
the customer, adding it, and holding up the product forever. Letting the
customer drive the product's features in this way means you are
delivering it sooner and learning what the customer wants.
</p><p>
And, frankly, you're going to make money on upgrades. This is the new
subscription model for software revenue. You get your product into as
many hands as possible with a low introductory price and then you sell
upgrades. By pushing things into the next version you have an upgrade
path which leads to a revenue stream from upgrade sales.
</p><p>
I hope this helps. Now, what I want to see from you all is a huge
outpouring of products for the BeOS. I'll consider all of them to be
inspired by this article. Thank you.

"Developers' Workshop" is a new weekly feature that provides answers to
our developers' questions. Each week, a Be technical support or
documentation professional will choose a question (or two) sent in by an
actual developer and provide an answer.
</p><p>
We've created a new section on our website. Please send us your
Newsletter topic suggestions by visiting the web site at:
http://www.be.com/developers/suggestion_box.html.
</p><p>
Having been reminded it was my turn to contribute a newsletter article, I
thought I would take this opportunity to bring you all up to speed about
what's going on in the "mothership" regarding Developer Support.
</p><p>
To begin with, we have two new people with whom all you developers will
be coming into contact. Doug Wright has joined DTS and is feverishly
pounding out sample code when not answering devsupport e-mail. The other
addition is Melanie Walker, our new "Web Diva." Melanie has also taken
over the approval and maintenance of BeWare submissions. Be forewarned,
she is not as lenient as I was...
</p><p>
We've also changed some operational details. Although this bit of news is
a little old, we have reorganized and cleaned up the FTP site. Sample
code is now found in one place on the ftp site:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/. This directory is futher broken down into
which version of the BeOS the sample code is from—something I imagine
will fade as developers no longer need code for a DR7 application.
</p><p>
Additionally, all BeWare that hasn't been updated to work with Preview
Release has been moved into its own directory tree to prevent confusing
naming conventions: ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/obsolete/.
</p><p>
The BeOS updates have earned their own directory:<br />
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/beos_updates/. Please note the
<code class="filename">developers/</code>
subdirectory—this is a place to hold developer-specific software (such
as the alpha version of the 3d Kit).
</p><p>
And lastly (in regards to the FTP site), we have now instituted a
.zip/.pkg-only archive rule. That is, all BeWare submissions are to be
sent as either a zipped directory containing your software or as a
SoftWare Valet .pkg archive. (Unfortunately, the Webmaster has fallen
behind in updating the online copy of the BeWare submission guidelines,
but if you want an updated copy for your records, send e-mail
ftparchive@be.com.)
<span class="bold"><strong>[Webmaster's Note: Hint taken, Brian! The Uploading
Guidelines have now been updated.]</strong></span>
</p><p>
The reason for this change is that both these archive formats retain the
attribute settings of the software they contain (and you'll notice the
archives' attributes themselves are preset in the <span class="application">FileTypes</span> Preferences).
Why do we want this? To enable a better user experience not only with the
BeOS, but with third-party BeWare software as well! It's true what they
say about first impressions, after all.
</p><p>
On the webscene, we've been getting some pretty positive comments about
the Sample Code section that Geoff worked up before he left:
http://www.be.com/developers/sample_code/index.html. The main idea is
once again to have _one_ central place to go to for sample code (it
mirrors the structure of the
<code class="filename">pub/samples/</code> subdirectory tree). There's
still a lot of work to be done on it, but as people are pretty happy with
it, we'll keep plugging away.
</p><p>
To finish, I would like to share some things we're planning and hope to
implement soon.
</p><p>
First, we are looking to hire another DTS Engineer in addition to a DTS
Manager: http://www.be.com/aboutbe/jobs/index.html. I guess Doug and I
are too unruly for Ed and Mel to handle by themselves. :-)
</p><p>
Also, we are looking to get back into the habit of holding regular
Developer Kitchens, especially with the Intel version coming out soon
(Got questions about the Intel release? Check out the Intel FAQs:
http://www.be.com/support/qandas/intel.html). Stay tuned to the developer
section of the website for updates on that:
http://www.be.com/developers/index.html.
</p><p>
That's pretty much it for now. I'm sure I'm forgetting something (I
always do :-), but those are the top issues that I wanted to share with
you all. Handling increased mail from Customer Support has been taking up
most of my time, but I am still intently watching the new Registered
Developer applications roll in (Got questions about what we're looking
for in our applications? Check out the guidelines:
http://www.be.com/developers/devprogramapp.html and, for my own personal
input, take a peek at my last newsletter article:
http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue80.html#Insight2). Until next
time...

We've been shipping our latest BeOS release, PR 2, for about two weeks
now. As a result, we're starting to get feedback from developers and
users and it is generally good, with the "generally" referring to fixes
and improvements we need to make in future releases, or in updates to be
posted on our site.
</p><p>
As with each release, we have been living in fear of some horrible
oversight in our design or testing procedures, soon exposed by an expert
user or, even worse, an innocent one. One of the classic problems is
testers become overly competent users; as hard as they may try, they
acquire some unconscious knowledge of the location of land mines—and
avoid the area. "Why did you do that?" "I don't know", replies the
dangerous user. In the same vein, knowing too much can lead to writing
upgrading instructions that mislead users. It can and we did. So, with
our apologies, we posted a "clarification" in
http://www.be.com/support/preview/upgrading_to_pr2.html.
</p><p>
The previous release, PR 1, was extremely ambitious, it introduced many
new features and a major rewrite of the file system. As a result, we also
introduced many new bugs and stability wasn't as good as we—and, more
importantly, developers and users—had hoped for. Fixes were quickly
posted as updates on our site and stability, more than features, was the
most important goal for PR2. So far, it looks like we've made progress.
I'm being careful here, in the early days of an OS there always exists
the potential for new execution paths to be discovered as leading to a
crash.
</p><p>
Many readers have probably seen the ZD Net BeHive report on PR 2. It can
be found at http://www3.zdnet.com/mac/behive/hacker15.html and is worth
reading, not just for the comments on PR2 stability itself, but also for
more application shipping news. There is even an interesting discussion
of r¡ design's work and some of the unique capabilities of the BeOS it
demonstrates, in this case BMessages. As we offer better stability and
BeOS developers start to show what the platform can do, we are getting
calls for more ways to utilize the basic capabilities of our product. As
a result, we are sitting with existing BeOS developers and gathering
their suggestions for better media capabilities in upcoming revisions.
</p><p>
As we do this, we're also gearing up to help BeOS developers make the
transition to the Intel Architecture version of the BeOS. By early
December, we will offer limited facilities to recompile and test already
shipping BeOS applications. We all want a running start on Intel—pun
unintended.
