This week, two separate articles caught my eye. They were about companies
repositioning technologies they have already spent a lot of time and
effort on over the last few years. First was Java, the all-singing,
all-dancing programming language that would break down the Babelian
barriers amongst all the varied client platforms in the world. With total
portability and write once run everywhere going for it, all (or all but
the most performance critical) applications would be written in Java,
once.
</p><p>
But now, with Netscape and others announcing their abandonment of
client-side Java development entirely, Java is being repositioned as a
"server-side technology." While the value of platform neutral, easily
distributable, interpreted binaries for server applications is eluding me
at present, I watch with interest for further news.
</p><p>
Second was the mumbled repositioning by Apple of Rhapsody as a "server
OS." I'll admit, we've heard with decreasing frequency about the future
of Rhapsody since the keynote session at Macworld Expo in January 1997
where Gil Amelio introduced Rhapsody as the future OS for Apple, and
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as "founder-advisors" returned to provide
occasional direction to the company.
</p><p>
A lot *has* happened since then (anybody heard more from Woz?), but even
I was surprised to see Apple's announcement of the future of Rhapsody as
a server OS, intended to complement and not to replace the aging Mac OS.
When Russell Brady, Apple's spokesman delivering this information was
questioned about the apparent change in plans, he responded, "We've never
positioned Rhapsody as anything but a server OS; anything else was made
up by the press." Hello?
</p><p>
Anyway, these repositionings got me to thinking about how we're doing
over the past few years as far as keeping to our original business
objectives. And I'm pleased to say that I think we've repositioned very
little. Our goal of providing a next generation operating system for use
with digital media (e.g. audio, video) has gone unchanged. Which is not
to say we haven't course corrected a little.
</p><p>
We did start in the hardware business as well as the software business.
Because two processors are better than one, especially when dealing with
streaming media, we built our OS to efficiently use more than one CPU. At
that time (the era of Mac OS and pre-NT), however, no one was building
inexpensive multiprocessor machines, so we built the BeBox, a dual
PowerPC desktop machine. A little while later, others began building
multiprocessor machines, so wasting as little time and money as possible,
we ported the BeOS to their platforms and got out of the hardware
business.
</p><p>
When we realized that a high performance, 64-bit file system is critical
to any OS wanting to call itself a media OS, we scrapped our original
file system and replaced it with one designed for digital video. And when
it seemed that Steve Jobs was hell bent on widening the gap between the
Intel installed base and the PowerPC installed base, we ported the OS
again.
</p><p>
We've come a long way by being responsive to the changing market
conditions around us, all the while holding true to our original goals.
Next month's Be Developer Conference gives us another opportunity to
listen to what is probably the most savvy segment of our customers and
colleagues, the developers. I'm looking forward to seeing you there and
collecting suggestions for next year's course corrections.
</p><p>
Just don't ask us to become a server OS.

I have a confession. I live for BeWare. The best part of my day is when I
sit down at my BeBox with a cup of tea to ftp the incoming apps to my
machine. My job is to test them. I unzip them, install them, give them a
go. If they pass the "pretty indestructible" test, I add them to the
BeWare area of the Be web site http://www.be.com/beware/index.html.
</p><p>
For those of you who are new to the BeOS, I thought I'd explain briefly
how BeWare works. And some of you "old hands" might be interested in
hearing about recent changes in BeWare. I'll also give you pointers on
how to find the BeWare you're looking for, and where to go for tips and
recommendations.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id663202"></a>BeWare Is...</h3></div></div></div><p>
BeWare is an area on the Be web site where you'll find freeware,
shareware, and commercial applications and utilities to download. There's
a wide variety of BeWare apps, that run the gamut from games and audio
players to development languages and utilities. This makes BeWare a great
resource for both users and developers. Developers have an added benefit
—many BeWare developers include their source code with their
applications.
</p><p>
Within BeWare, you can peruse available applications alphabetically, by
category ("Audio," "Video," "Utilities," etc.), or by selecting "What's
New" for a list of recent arrivals. For each application you'll find a
description of the app, file size information, alternate download sites,
links to related web pages, and sometimes screen shots.
</p><p>
To download an item from BeWare, you can either click on the download
link, or once you know the file name, you can ftp it directly from
ftp://ftp.be.com. Once you've downloaded the app successfully and
expanded it, you're set to go.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id663237"></a>Uploading BeWare</h3></div></div></div><p>
You must be a registered Be Developer to upload BeWare. (For more
information on becoming a registered developer, see
http://www.be.com/developers/.) Once you've registered, the upload
process is simple and direct. You'll find the complete guidelines for
uploading BeWare at http://www.be.com/developers/ftp/, but here's a
summary:
</p><p>
Fill out the "Add BeWare" form in the Registered Developer Area
http://www.be.com/developers/, upload your app, and send e-mail to
ftparchive@be.com with the name of your app in the subject field. Within
the day, your app should be up on BeWare.
</p><p>
Just one caveat: Since the BeWare section is generated by scripts that
manipulate the information in the BeWare record you create, it is very
important to fill out your BeWare record accurately. For example, if you
list your application as "foobar.zip", when you upload your app, make
sure it's called "foobar.zip", and not "foo_bar.zip", "Foobar.zip," or
some other variant.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id663271"></a>Recent Changes in the BeWare Area</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you haven't visited BeWare for a while, you'll discover that it's been
reorganized. Applications and utilities are now classified within each
category according to their function. For example, within the Audio
category, sub-categories include "Editing," "Playback," and "Recording."
You'll also notice that when you click on an application's name, you go
to a page dedicated to that BeWare application. Giving each app its own
page cuts down on loading time and gives the author more space to include
a description or links to screen shots and other related URLs. All in the
name of better service!

If you're eager to try new BeWare, but don't know where to begin, there
are several places to look for recommendations. Be hosts the BeWare Gem
of the Day on the front page of the web site. Other sources for reviews
and recommendations include BeOS Central, Be Leading Edge, and Be Dope.

<span class="bold"><strong>[Webmaster's Note:</strong></span> This article has been corrected since its original

</p><p>
As we draw closer to the first release of BeOS for Intel, a whole new
generation of BeOS programmers is preparing to enter unknown territory.
In order to help introduce them to writing BeOS applications (and to help
PowerPC programmers get started with the BeOS), my next few articles for
the Be Newsletter will comprise a brief introductory course on BeOS
programming.
</p><p>
This week, we're going to build a very basic application. Can you say
"Hello, world?" This article and the sample application we'll create will
show you how to do that.
</p><p>
Yes, that's right, we'll be writing "Hello World" as a BeOS application.
We'll create application, window, and view objects, and draw text into a
view. This article won't tell you everything you'll ever need to know,
but it should at least get you up and running with your first application
so you can start experimenting. In fact, you should keep a copy of the
<a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565922875/ref=sr_11_1/102-6761474-6780910?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Be Developer's Guide</a>
or the online <a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/index-3.html">Be Book</a>
handy as you read this article.
</p><p>
For this project, you'll need the following header files included in your
source code:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;Application.h&gt;
#include &lt;Window.h&gt;
#include &lt;View.h&gt;
</pre><p>
Let's begin at the beginning: The <code class="classname">BApplication</code> class. This class defines
a BeOS application. In essence, the <code class="classname">BApplication</code> class represents the
link between your application and the Application Server. The Application
Server handles messaging, imaging, and other good stuff that most
applications need to do. So before you can draw on the screen or accept
or transmit messages, you have to create a <code class="classname">BApplication</code> object.
</p><p>
Typically, you'll do this by creating your own class, derived from
<code class="classname">BApplication</code>, so you can augment or override certain methods to customize
the behavior of your application. In our Hello World program, we'll be
creating a class called <span class="application">HelloApp</span> to serve this purpose. An application's
<code class="function">main()</code> function's primary duty is to create
the <code class="classname">BApplication</code> (or an
object of a class derived from <code class="classname">BApplication</code>) and to invoke it. Before we
create <span class="application">HelloApp</span>, let's look at a typical
<code class="function">main()</code> function (in fact, this
is the <code class="function">main()</code> our Hello World program will use):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">main</code>(<span class="type">void</span>) {
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">HelloApp</code> *</span><code class="varname">theApp</code>;    <span class="comment">// Pointer to our application object</span>
  <code class="varname">theApp</code> = new <code class="classname">HelloApp</code>;

  <code class="varname">theApp</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Run</code>();

  delete <code class="varname">theApp</code>;
}
</pre><p>
All <code class="function">main()</code> does here is create a new
<code class="classname">HelloApp</code> object, which is derived
from <code class="classname">BApplication</code>, as we'll see in a few moments. Once that's done, the
application's <code class="methodname">Run()</code> method is invoked.
The <code class="methodname">Run()</code> method is the
application's event loop. It won't return until the application is
terminated.
</p><p>
Once the <code class="methodname">Run()</code> method returns, we delete the application object, since
our program is about to terminate, so we don't need the object anymore.
</p><p>
It's useful to remember that the global variable <code class="varname">be_app</code> always points to
your application's <code class="classname">BApplication</code> object. That means you don't have to keep
a pointer to your application object around if you don't want to,
although if you call any custom methods added to the object, you'll need
to cast <code class="varname">be_app</code> to your class.
</p><p>
Now let's look at the <code class="classname">HelloApp</code> class:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">HelloApp</code> : public <code class="classname">BApplication</code> {
  public:
    <code class="methodname">HelloApp</code>();

  private:
    <span class="type"><code class="classname">HelloWindow</code>    *</span><code class="varname">theWindow</code>;
};
</pre><p>
As mentioned earlier, <code class="classname">HelloApp</code> is derived
from <code class="classname">BApplication</code>. We only need
the constructor to get done what we need to do, so that's the only public
method we define. A single private variable, <code class="varname">theWindow</code>, is used to store
a pointer to our application's window.
</p><p>
Let's check out the <code class="classname">HelloApp</code> constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">HelloApp</code>::<code class="methodname">HelloApp</code>()
      : <code class="classname">BApplication</code>("application/x-vnd.Be-HelloWorld")
{
  <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">windowRect</code>;

  <code class="varname">windowRect</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(50,50,200,200);
  <code class="varname">theWindow</code> = new <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code>(<code class="varname">windowRect</code>);
}
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">HelloApp</code> constructor defers to the
<code class="classname">BApplication</code> constructor, passing
the string "application/x-vnd.Be-HelloWorld". This odd-looking string is
the application's signature. It specifies that the application is an
application, and that the vendor is Be, Incorporated. The application's
name is "HelloWorld". This is the standard way we identify applications;
this string can be used by other programs to locate your application and
pass messages to it.
</p><p>
Once the object has been constructed, we create a <code class="classname">BRect</code>.
<code class="classname">BRect</code> is a
rectangle object (described in the Interface Kit chapter of the Be
Developer's Guide). It's used to define a rectangular area on the screen,
given the top, left, right, and bottom edges of the rectangle, and it has
several methods for setting and retrieving the position and size of the
rectangle.
</p><p>
One of these methods is <code class="methodname">Set()</code>, which we use to set
the rectangle to occupy the area from <code class="literal">(50,50)</code> to
<code class="literal">(200,200)</code> in space. This establishes a rectangle 151
pixels wide and 151 pixels tall. The arguments to
<code class="methodname">Set()</code> are in the order: left, top, right, bottom.
</p><p>
That <code class="classname">BRect</code> object is then passed to the
<code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> constructor when we
create our window object; this rectangle is used to position and size the
window on the screen when it is created. Note that we save the window
pointer in the <code class="classname">HelloApp</code>'s <code class="varname">theWindow</code>
field. That must mean it's time to
look over the <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> class:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> : public <code class="classname">BWindow</code> {
  public:
    <code class="methodname">HelloWindow</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>);
    virtual <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="methodname">QuitRequested</code>();
};
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> class has a constructor, which
accepts a <code class="classname">BRect</code> object as
an argument (as discussed previously), and a <code class="methodname">QuitRequested()</code> method. Note
that <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> is derived from <code class="classname">BWindow</code>,
which is the class from which
all windows are derived on the BeOS.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">HelloWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">HelloWindow</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>)
      : <code class="classname">BWindow</code>(<code class="parameter">frame</code>, "Hello World", <code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW</code>,
        <code class="constant">B_NOT_RESIZABLE</code>|<code class="constant">B_NOT_ZOOMABLE</code>)
{
  <code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(new <code class="classname">HelloView</code>(<code class="methodname">Bounds</code>()));
  <code class="methodname">Show</code>();
}
</pre><p>
The constructor, shown above, defers to the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> constructor to set up
the window. The frame rectangle specified as the argument to the
constructor is passed through, and the window's name is specified by the
string "Hello World". <code class="constant">B_TITLED_WINDOW</code> is a flag indicating the type of
window to create: A standard window with a tab at the top where the title
and close box should draw.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_NOT_RESIZABLE</code> and <code class="constant">B_NOT_ZOOMABLE</code>
are flags that indicate that the
window can't be zoomed (it won't have a zoom box) or resized.
</p><p>
Once the window is constructed, we need to add a view to the window.
Views are containers for other views. This is an interesting concept, and
it's an important one to understand. Windows are containers for views.
You typically can't draw directly into a window. You have to create a
view and attach it to the window first.
</p><p>
A window can have as many or as few views attached to it as you want, and
each view can have subviews. We'll develop this further in my next
article. For now, our application's window has a single view.
</p><p>
In our case, we want the view to be the exact size of the window, and
fill the window completely. So when we instantiate our <code class="classname">HelloView</code> (which
we'll look at shortly), we pass the <code class="classname">BRect</code>
returned by the <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>
method. <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code> is a method of the
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> class that returns the
"bounds rectangle" of the window.
</p><p>
The bounds rectangle is a rectangle that indicates the area occupied by a
window, but in coordinates local to the window. This is another important
concept to grasp.
</p><p>
If your computer has a 640 x 480 screen, the top-left corner of the
screen has the coordinates <code class="literal">(0,0)</code> and the bottom-right corner of the
screen is at <code class="literal">(639,479)</code>. These are called "screen coordinates." When you
create a window, you specify the location of the window on the screen
using screen coordinates.
</p><p>
Once the window has been created, anything you do inside that window is
done in "local coordinates." Just as screen coordinates have the top-left
corner of the screen at <code class="literal">(0,0)</code>, local coordinates have the top-left corner
of the window at <code class="literal">(0,0)</code>.
</p><p>
The <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code> method in the <code class="classname">BWindow</code>
class returns the window's rectangle
in local coordinates, so in our program's case, this rectangle will be
<code class="literal">(0,0)-(150,150)</code>, which is exactly what we want.
</p><p>
We pass this <code class="classname">BRect</code> to the <code class="classname">HelloView</code>
constructor so the view will fill the
entire window. We'll study the <code class="classname">HelloView</code> class next.
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">HelloView</code> pointer that's returned by new
is then passed to <code class="classname">BWindow</code>'s
<code class="methodname">AddChild()</code> method. As we already learned, windows are containers for
views. The views that a window contains are called "children." The
<code class="methodname">AddChild()</code> method, then, adds a view to a window, thereby making that
view a child of the window. Once a view is added to a window, any drawing
done inside the view is visible in the window (assuming both the view and
the window are visible, but we'll get into that another time).
</p><p>
Once the child view has been added to the window, we call <code class="methodname">Show()</code>. This
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> method makes the window
visible—all <code class="classname">BWindow</code>s are hidden until
you call this method.
</p><p>
The other method we define for the <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code>
class, <code class="methodname">QuitRequested()</code>, is
called whenever someone attempts to close our window. This happens if the
user clicks the close box, for example. Here's the code:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">QuitRequested</code>() {
  <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code>);
  return <code class="constant">true</code>;
}
</pre><p>
This is very simple. We simply post a <code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code> message to the
application. By default, when a <code class="classname">BApplication</code> object receives this
message, its <code class="methodname">Run()</code> method simply exits (which then returns control to our
<code class="function">main()</code> function, which deletes the application object and exits).
</p><p>
Then we return true to indicate that we're granting permission to close
the window. If <code class="methodname">QuitRequested()</code> returns <code class="constant">false</code>,
this indicates to the
caller that for whatever reason, they shouldn't close the window. An
obvious application of this would be to present an alert reminding the
user they haven't saved their work yet, with the option for the user
cancel whatever operation was about to close the window.
</p><p>
Finally, let's see the <code class="classname">HelloView</code> class, which
is derived from <code class="classname">BView</code>.
Views are the contexts in which all drawing is done.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">HelloView</code> : public <code class="classname">BView</code> {
  public:
    <code class="methodname">HelloView</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>);
    virtual <span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">updateRect</code>);
};
</pre><p>
Our <code class="classname">HelloView</code> class has a constructor, which
accepts a <code class="classname">BRect</code> identifying
the size and position the view should occupy within its parent, and a
<code class="methodname">Draw()</code> method, which is called by the Application Server to update the
contents of the view.
</p><p>
The constructor looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">HelloView</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>)
      : <code class="classname">BView</code>(<code class="parameter">frame</code>, "HelloView", <code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_ALL_SIDES</code>,
              <code class="constant">B_WILL_DRAW</code>) {
}
</pre><p>
As you can tell, we don't do anything in the constructor: We simply defer
to the <code class="classname">BView</code> constructor, passing through the frame rectangle. The view's
name is "HelloView". We specify the <code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_ALL_SIDES</code> flag for our
resizing mode, which indicates that the view will always fill the
complete window, even if the window is moved or resized, and the
<code class="constant">B_WILL_DRAW</code> flag, which tells the Application Server that we're
implementing a <code class="methodname">Draw()</code> method that needs to be called for updates.
</p><p>
The Application Server calls <code class="methodname">Draw()</code> whenever the window's contents need
to be updated. This occurs if another window passes in front of ours, or
when the window is initially shown. A <code class="classname">BRect</code> is passed to the method,
indicating the area of the view that needs to be redrawn.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">updateRect</code>) {
  <code class="methodname">MovePenTo</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(20,75));      <span class="comment">// Move pen</span>
  <code class="methodname">DrawString</code>("Hello, world!");
}
</pre><p>
As you can see, in Hello World, we're ignoring the <code class="varname">updateRect</code>. We
position the pen at coordinates <code class="literal">(20,75)</code> by creating a <code class="classname">BPoint</code> object
(which represents a point on the screen) with those coordinates, then
passing that point to the <code class="methodname">MovePenTo()</code> method.
</p><p>
Once the pen has been positioned where we want it, we call <code class="methodname">DrawString()</code>
to draw the message "Hello, world!" into the view.
</p><p>
The sample code for my article will be on the Be FTP site in:
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/intro/obsolete/helloworld_article.zip
</p><p>
In my next article, we'll investigate how you can use multiple views in a
window, and begin looking at some basic user interface features. For now,
poke through the Be Developer's Guide and the
<code class="filename">Application.h</code>,
<code class="filename">Window.h</code>,
and <code class="filename">View.h</code>
header files and do some exploring on your own.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee3-7"></a>BeDC, Be Dope, and Be Europe</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
It's a laundry list, but let's start with Be Europe. Last week, in
telling how we "paved the runway," i.e., raised the funds needed to
launch the BeOS platform in the Intel space, I left a significant pothole
in my story. I forgot to credit the Be Europe team for its contribution
to this successful financing round. At the last tally, slightly less than
25% of the funds raised came from Europe, and we couldn't have done it
without Jean Calmon and his team. I'm red-faced for my slip of the
electric pencil.
</p><p>
Now Be Dope, which attentive readers of our Web site have noticed a
reference to. Check it out, it is good entertainment and, occasionally,
good information—http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/7587/.
</p><p>
However, I must take exception to an item that offers an ingenious
explanation for my name. Among other twists, the story alleges that I was
actually born in New Jersey. I guess I should be flattered, right?
</p><p>
Since my past is under scrutiny, I might as well confess. I wasn't born
in New Jersey. As always though, there is a grain of truth: I once worked
in New Jersey. During a lapse in sanity, because I believed what was
printed in Fortune magazine before Stewart Alsop started contributing,
and because I listened to a headhunter, I ended up working for a company
based in the charming locale of Florham Park, NJ. That company was Exxon
Office Systems.
</p><p>
Exxon misexecuted a belief in the right idea: Information as the oil of
the 21st century. They were right—we know who the new Standard Oil is
and who the new Rockefellers are—but their concept of a bit wasn't
helpful in the computer business. So, all right, I did it, in New Jersey,
but it was a genuine misunderstanding on both sides.
</p><p>
I'm indisputably French, as John Dvorak attested. Feeling my pain, he
once introduced me as the mind of a Frenchman unfortunately trapped in
the body of a Frenchman. Too true. In any case, read Be Dope, even more
fun and relevant than Wired—and a lot easier on the eye.
</p><p>
As for my e-mail .sig, I'll have to drop the Dvorak quotation soon, it's
getting old. I'm taking suggestions, you know where to find me. I could
use "a French farmer abducted by aliens and raised in California by VCs,"
but that could be construed as slander by the venture community whose
existence I cherish and whose name I only invoke with the greatest
respect. Suggestions should be mindful of family values (this
recommendation is meant particularly for a certain Be engineer whose
T-shirts would cause HR to faint, if we had an HR department).
</p><p>
Lastly, the Be Developers' Conference.<br />
http://www.be.com/developers/BeDC_schedule.html is the link to the
program of the event. Contrary to our previous conferences, we're not
holding it on a weekend, or preceding or following another industry
event, and we are even charging $95 for it, a little less if you
registered early.
</p><p>
Beyond the "free" T-shirt and the wonderful buffet lunches, we intend to
make the content and delivery of the sessions worth your time and money.
Much has evolved in the BeOS, beyond and because of the move to
Intel-based hardware—new applications, more function in the OS, new
tools and utilities. Please come and see what the Be engineers and your
colleagues and competitors have done. I look forward to seeing you in
four weeks.
