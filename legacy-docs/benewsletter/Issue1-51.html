Architecture</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Dominic</span> <span class="surname">Giampaolo</span></span></div></div></div><p>Earlier this year, we decided to overhaul the file system and database.
Our overriding goals were to merge the file system and database at a low
level, improve file access performance—and to do this without losing
any features. In particular, the database query system had to be just as
flexible and "live" as it is now. There were other issues that we wanted
to address as well: Support for external file systems, partitioning,
better parallelism in file system operations, journaling, and so on.
</p><p>In this article, I'm going to talk about the design of the file system
structures proper; I'll leave the discussion of how to access the
structures to Cyril Meurillon, the French half of Be's International File
System team. Look for his article in next week's Newsletter.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508568"></a>Hierarchy or Not?</h3></div></div></div><p>To begin with, we had to decide what overall structure the file system
would take: Do we stick with a traditional, hierarchical, name-based
organization, or do we burn our bridges and attempt an attributed,
database-style flat file system?
</p><p>Although I favor hierarchical organization, I like to think that this
bias is not without reason or experience: As a graduate CS student, I
spent a great deal of time (and wrote a thesis) attempting to prove the
concept of an attributed, flat file system in which every file access is
expressed as a query. It's an attractive abstraction that, for example,
provides a great deal of flexibility for grouping files. Although
implementing this architecture wasn't a cake walk, trying to come up with
a reasonable interface for the user was a minor nightmare. The biggest
problem (for you, the file system user) is that in a flat, query-based
system, you not only must specify what you want to see, you often must
specify much or all of what you *don't* want to see; your choices are
*too* open. In the end, I found that the familiar "restriction" of the
traditional hierarchy—a limited number of "choices" (files and
directories) within a single domain (names)—was a powerful tool in
itself and one that we often take for granted.
</p><p>The architecture of the new Be file system is a "best of both worlds"
solution: The basic organization is hierarchical, but individual files
can contain "attributes":
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Because it's hierarchical, the user should have no trouble navigating
the file system, whether from a command line or through the Browser.
</p></li><li><p>The inclusion of attributes within files means that the system can
also be accessed through queries.
</p></li></ul><p>The hierarchy needs no explanation. Attributes are described below.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508615"></a>Attributes</h3></div></div></div><p>Any file can have a collection of "extra information"—such as
comments, information about where the file came from, keywords extracted
from a document, and so on. These bits of information are called the
file's "attributes." Each attribute is represented as a name/value pair,
where the name acts as a key to the value. For example,
</p><pre class="screen">
"Priority=Urgent"
</pre><p>is a an attribute whose name is "Priority" and whose value is "Urgent".
</p><p>The name of an attribute is always a (short) text string. The value can
be data of any type and any length.
</p><p>If an attribute's value is a string, integer, or floating- point value --
in other words, if the value can be easily compared—you can ask that
it be indexed. Values that can't be indexed are stored as raw byte
streams on disk. We chose B+Trees as our indexing method for two
principal reasons:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>B+Trees offer good performance with large numbers of items.
</p></li><li><p>The structure is well known and fairly well understood.
</p></li></ul><p>In addition to indexing, we also use B+Trees to store the contents of
directories (a directory can actually be thought of as a type of index).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508675"></a>File Details</h3></div></div></div><p>Each file is represented by a single "header block"; this is a disk block
that contains information such as the time the file was created, when it
was last modified, who owns it, and so on. Most importantly, the header
can tell you the "primary data stream" of the file (this is the data
that, in practice, we think of as being the file itself), and contains
pointers to the file's attributes.
</p><p>The default header information easily fits in a single disk block; the
leftover block space is used to store "small" attributes directly.
Typically, the most common attributes are stored in the header, so with
one disk read (i.e., one look at the header itself) you get a bunch of
useful information. The data for "indirect" attributes—attributes that
spill out of the header block—become files themselves. In fact, the
list of attributes associated with a single file is represented as a
separate directory.
</p><p>Header blocks are created dynamically—you don't have to specify up
front how many files your disk can hold. Thus, you don't waste disk space
on as-yet-unused headers. The downside to this approach is that the
header blocks tend to be scattered around the disk, so access to a
logically contiguous group of files (the files in a directory, for
example) could send the disk into a searching frenzy. In practice,
however, this doesn't really seem to be much of a problem.
</p><p>A file's data is mapped to actual disk blocks ("data blocks") through a
"data stream" structure. The structure contains a list of "block runs";
each block run specifies a starting block number and the number of blocks
that are in the run (up to 65,535 blocks per run).
</p><p>The blocks in a single run are always contiguous. However, the separate
runs that make up a file aren't (if two runs happen to be contiguous, the
file system will melt them into a single run). Since file-seeking sanity
pleads for as much contiguity as possible, we pre-allocate some number of
blocks automatically when a new run is asked for. This protects against
file fragmentation when you perform a series of small writes (a single
large write will be inherently contiguous). The size of the
pre-allocation depends on the size of the file that you're writing to:
The bigger the current size of the file, the greater the allocation.
</p><p>The size of a single disk block is settable; the minimum size is 512
bytes, the maximum is 8k. You have to declare the size of your disk
blocks when you initialize your disk.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508726"></a>Journaling</h3></div></div></div><p>An important new feature of the file system is "journaling." Journaling
is a technique for preserving the integrity of on-disk data structures.
The basic idea is that the disk blocks that are involved in a disk
modification (file creation, deletion, write, and so on) are written to
the disk's "journal" *before* they're actually written to their final
resting places on the disk. This ensures that your disk's structures will
be consistent even if you crash during a disk access:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>If you crash before the journal entry is written for a given
operation then the operation will appear to have never happened.
</p></li><li><p>If you crash while data blocks are being written (that is, after the
journal blocks have been written), the system will "replay" the journal
entry when you reboot, and the aborted transactions will complete
normally.
</p></li><li><p>If you were to crash after the data blocks were flushed, but before
the journal entry was removed, the disk blocks would simply be
re-written.
</p></li></ul><p>Journaling ensures integrity, but it can't guarantee that the file system
will always be 100% up to date. That is, because disk blocks get buffered
in memory, a crash may prevent some of them from making it to the
journal. Thus, when you reboot you won't see the transactions that died
in the cache. So, for example, that would mean that you might not see the
last file that was created before a power failure—but your hard disk
wouldn't be corrupted.

fast. Hopefully, it will weather all the abuse that it's surely going to
be subjected to. Our testing methodology includes running stress programs
that create and delete many files, checking data integrity, and we have
plans for our intern George to thrash the file system thoroughly with
respect to multiprocessor access to the file system. We have already
survived some 24-hour stress tests that created and deleted many hundreds
of thousands of files and we plan on beating on the system until we'd
trust it even with our own most treasured code and love letters.
</p><p>And that brings to a close this 80,000 foot overview of the new Be file
system.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering1-51-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: Be User Interface Basics</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Roy</span> <span class="surname">West</span></span></div></div></div><p>The Be development environment is designed to make it easy and fun for
you to create powerful, innovative applications. Similarly, the
soon-to-appear Be user interface guidelines will be designed to help you
create applications that your customers will find easy and fun to
explore, learn, and use.
</p><p>The BeOS doesn't try to reinvent the graphical user interface. Instead,
it builds on the successful interfaces developed on a variety of
platforms over the past dozen years. What's new in the BeOS is a
lightweight, multitasking environment that's not beholden to bad UI
design entrenched in legacy UI schemes.
</p><p>You should aim to create applications that users find obvious, so they
can discover and quickly come to appreciate the power (and value) of your
application's features. Users shouldn't need to read all (or even any) of
an application's documentation to guess how to perform most of the things
it can do for them—even if they don't understand what the application
is doing at first! Even if many of your application's features are
sophisticated and require detailed explanation, you can design them in a
way that will help users catch on quickly if you organize them in menus
and panels, so users have some categories and topics to look up in the
documentation as a head start.
</p><p>This article introduces you to the basic principles of the Be UI
guidelines. Look for details and examples in a forthcoming edition of The
Be Book.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508859"></a>Be Obvious</h3></div></div></div><p>All of an application's features should be visible as menu items or as
buttons or other controls in windows or panels. Avoid implementing
features that require users to hold down keys on the keyboard, use the
secondary or tertiary mouse buttons, or type commands they have to
remember: These techniques are great for shortcuts and they may become
the preferred techniques for users experienced with an application, but
you should allow users to perform each action in a more obvious way first.
</p><p>Don't hide your application's features or users won't find them. Most
users refer to documentation when they have a question. If users don't
stumble on a feature, they won't think to look up the details in the
documentation, no matter how clearly written it is.
</p><p>Make every context clear: For example, it should be obvious what
application every panel belongs to and what users can or should do in it.
If a panel asks for information, make it clear what application is asking
and what part of that application is affected.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508894"></a>Be Graphical</h3></div></div></div><p>Users find and remember features best if they perform them by directly
manipulating objects on the screen—selecting tools, dragging objects
to move or alter their attributes, and so on, rather then by selecting an
object and then finding a command to perform a function. For example,
it's easier and more natural-feeling for a user to rotate an object by
dragging a handle, than by selecting the object and choosing a Rotate
command or* entering settings in a panel.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508913"></a>Be Consistent</h3></div></div></div><p>Use similar UI for similar features, from application to application, and
within an application. Users will often guess how to do something new if
the UI looks and works like other UI they already know.
</p><p>When inventing new UI, try to build on existing UI rather than invent
from whole cloth: This gives users a leg up. And never create UI that
behaves opposite to other well- known UI—that's an easy way to create
a feature that users will trip on every time.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508935"></a>Be Responsive</h3></div></div></div><p>Make it obvious to users that what they're trying to do is working—or
not working. Users are often unsure whether they're doing something
right, or whether they've done it at all. Help them by providing feedback
for each user action.
</p><p>If a task will take more than a moment, open a status panel that shows
the progress of the action. Put the user in control by providing the
panel with a Cancel (and maybe a Pause) button. Users don't know how long
a new activity will take, and often think actions that take longer than
expected simply haven't started at all.
</p><p>When users manipulate graphical controls, tools, and so on, show them
that their actions are having an effect. If different parts of your
application's UI react differently when clicked, dragged, or pressed,
change the shape of the cursor or provide some other visual clue to
inform users that something different will happen. For example, when a
user selects an on-screen object, highlight it. It's also helpful to
change the shape of the cursor when it's over editable text or when a
modal tool is selected.
</p><p>Provide feedback throughout the steps of dragging and dropping: Show that
the object is selected for dragging, consider changing the cursor to
provide a clue as to what action the drag-and-drop will perform, and
highlight or in some other way indicate that the target of the
drag-and-drop will receive the object when the mouse button is released.
</p><p>When a user changes a setting, apply the new value immediately if
possible. A second-best approach is to apply a setting when the user
clicks a Set or Apply button. Avoid forcing users to restart an
application to make a new setting take effect.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508980"></a>Be Cooperative</h3></div></div></div><p>Users become confident in an application (and thus learn it more quickly)
if they know they're in control—that is, if it performs only actions
that a user initiates. Resist the temptation to help out users by
changing information or the state of controls behind their backs. It's
good to try to learn from a user's habits and remember preferred settings
in panels, arrangements of windows, and other state they've set in the
past, but don't "improve on" what the user has done if the reason isn't
obvious and the improvement wouldn't be expected.
</p><p>Maintain the state users set in windows even when they switch to other
windows or applications. For example, if text is selected in a panel,
don't unselect it when a user makes another window active; be sure the
highlighting is restored when the panel is made active again.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id508999"></a>Be Multitasking</h3></div></div></div><p>The BeOS makes it easy for many applications to work simultaneously, and
for each application to perform many tasks at once. Structure your
application so that when activities in one area will take a while or must
pause to request information from the user, activities in other areas of
the application and in other applications continue uninterrupted.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id509016"></a>Be Forgiving</h3></div></div></div><p>Users make mistakes, but they shouldn't be punished for them. Try to
alert users if their action risks losing data, and try to make it easy
for them to undo actions they might regret.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id509030"></a>Be Innovative</h3></div></div></div><p>The BeOS is a new world, with plenty of room to invent new ways of
working and playing. Feel free to violate these UI guidelines if you have
new ideas, but violate them for a deliberate and clear purpose. Users may
come to love your new way to copy text, but if your new technique is only
subtly or arbitrarily different than what they're used to in other
applications, they'll simply be annoyed. Innovate boldly!

At least that's what my wife
tells me. But it can be done. She just completed El Tour de Tuscon, a
bicycling event for which she trained over the past 4 months. The
training was long, hard and tiresome. She had to down a lot of PowerBars
and Goo, and in the end, it was over in 10 hours 3 minutes. During this
whole time, my daughter and I were the cheering section. All we could do
is offer support and encourage her to completion.
</p><p>Working with a new platform, particularly the BeOS, is nothing like
training for a 111-mile bike ride—except for those who actually go out
and give demos around the country and the world. And that's what our
intrepid marketing people have been doing. Last week found Be marketers
at Comdex, and on the East coast. From what I remember of my Comdex
experience of the past, it can be much like running a marathon for 4
days. The Be folks were there spreading their enthusiasm for the platform
and no doubt showing their glee for being able to work at such a fun
place as Be, Inc.
</p><p>Why do people participate in such endeavors? Because of the excitement of
finishing, the challenge of running the race, the rush you get when you
near the finish. All this and probably more. Can a computing platform
provide such excitement? I think so.
</p><p>One of our third-party developers has been spending sleepless days for
the past few weeks working on what they think will be a very good video
editing suite. When I stared into the tired programmer's sleepy eyes,
looking for the fire that drove him on, the spark came through as he said
in a groggy voice "This is fun; it's a lot more fun than anything I've
done recently." And then he staggered to his car, and hopefully made it
home.
</p><p>Here at Be we express our excitement and enthusiasm for the platform by
performing feats of daring do. We constantly generate what we think is
useful code, and strive to complete that next big thing, and several
small meaningful things along the way. Hopefully our excitement is
showing through as we complete yet another desirable feature, or announce
yet another supported PowerPC platform. And in the end, there are the
sample apps.
</p><p>I've programmed on many systems over the past 15 years or so. One of the
interesting ones was NeXTSTEP. As a first programming task I wrote a
talking clock program. You could set an alarm to go off either
periodically at a set interval or at a fixed time. This is great for
reminding you to stand up every 15 minutes when you're programming so you
don't cramp up.
</p><p>To perform this feat, I recorded my wife saying the numbers from 1 to 10,
and all the 10's, and a few of the higher multiples of 10 (hundred,
thousand,...). Then we recorded things like "the time is", "o'clock", and
all the days of the week, and then at last all the months of the year. We
then matched the gain on all the sounds, and smoothed them out enough so
that they could be run together and actually sound like a phrase with
minimal clipping, popping or hissing.
</p><p>The end result is that we have this nice library of sounds in my wife's
voice. So what to do with such a valuable resource? Why make a code
sample of course! You can find it at:
</p><p>ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/sndutil.tgz
</p><p>When it comes right down to it, if you want to play with sound in the
BeOS, you have to get down and learn about BAudioSubscriber and the use
of streams. It's really not a big deal, and neither are the two programs
included in this package—"playsound" and "sndplay." playsound is a
simple utility that allows you to play a single sound file. You can set
parameters such as the frame rate, number of channels, and so forth.
</p><p>Or you can just let the system take a crack at it. The other utility is
sndplay. You can pass it multiple files on the command line, and it will
string them together into a phrase. There are 3 sound files included from
the Anita Sound Resource talking clock package. These files are uLaw
encoded sounds, as is typical for UNIX platforms. So you will find a
uLaw-to-linear conversion algorithm in the package.
</p><p>These code samples are meant to be very simple to understand and give the
novice sound programmer a leg up. If you haven't already gotten fully
immersed into sound on the BeOS, then here is your chance. We can explore
more detailed and interesting aspects of the sound system in the future,
including how MIDI fits in, and what you can and can't do in a bucket
brigade.
</p><p>So there you have it, a long story to get to a short sample. MacWorld is
coming, and we're training hard. If you're a developer you should be
working very hard to prepare your wares for this Marathon of an event. If
you are a spectator, then prepare yourself for what will surely be an
exciting and fun filled show.

Computing. Detailed information is available on our Web site. The
fundamentals of the partnership are simple: The BeOS adds value to
Power's hardware and it opens the door to multi-processor applications.
Power Computing opens a fast growing installed base to the BeOS and
developers writing code for the platform. Furthermore, Power Computing
customers typically are heat-seekers, leading-edge users, as opposed to
those staying with the main brand. This is a natural fit with our own
positioning. As an emerging company, we focus on developers and customers
who appreciate the bandwidth, agility, and stability required in digital
content creation and serving applications.
</p><p>Steve Kahng, Power Computing's CEO, was gracious in acknowledging his
initial reservations. Dealing with "yet another OS" wasn't his idea of
fun in the midst of a fast ramp-up following the market's reaction to
Power's entry into the Macintosh hardware market. We are thankful to his
organization, to developers and customers for making him a strong
supporter of this alliance.
</p><p>It started right after Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in May. The
Friday preceding the conference, we found a voice-mail message informing
us we couldn't display the BeBox in the exhibition area we had reserved
and paid for months before "because we were not a Macintosh developer."
The misunderstanding was quickly and graciously cleared up, but one
engineer had already suggested we port our software to a PowerMac, thus
making us a true if not yet tried Mac developer. We approached both Power
Computing and Apple with a proposal. Power jumped at the opportunity;
Apple joined in later. Executives and engineers supported our effort.
</p><p>We showed up at MacWorld with the BeOS running on our hardware and on
Power's. As people saw the Mac OS and the BeOS running on the same
hardware, it became easier to understand what we brought to the Mac
market. All this, at least the part between Power and Be, happened on a
handshake. The executives and the engineers knew each other, this was an
obvious good idea, let's do it, we'll feed the lawyers later. The
reaction at MacWorld was very positive, we spent a little money on
members of the learned profession, and here we are. Life can be simple
sometimes.
</p><p>While much remains to be done, this is an auspicious beginning. We expect
the relationship to flourish as Power sales continue to develop and as
our young operating system is tested in the marketplace.
</p><p>Now, you might ask, what about the bigger PowerMac hardware manufacturer?
Will they follow Power Computing's example and, seeing we add value to
their hardware, bundle our little BeOS CD with most of their machines? I
don't know, and that's not for me to say. But I'm sure we can work out an
inexpensive and uncomplicated arrangement.
</p><p>Seriously now, our thanks to the like-minded and like-goaled people at
Power Computing. They understand famished start- ups: they sent us pizza
today.

</h5></div></div></div><p>This week:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>How smart should a scripting language be? Are things like
polymorphism and inheritance appropriate?
</p></li><li><p>Should a script be able to "drive" an application's interface, or
should it be just be a means for commanding application A to ask
application B to perform an operation over some data.
</p></li><li><p>When you create a script of a user's actions, do you record (and

if you can avoid it). This led to the observation that a <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> blocked
thread must be <code class="function">kill_thread()</code>'d because there's
no <code class="classname">BLocker</code> timeout API.
</p><p>THE BE LINE: You ask for it, you get it: DR9 will include a
<code class="methodname">LockWithTimeout()</code> call in the
<code class="classname">BLocker</code> and <code class="classname">BLooper</code> classes.

Many folks
think not. In addition to taking votes, the thread discussed different
methods for sending windows to the back, bringing them to the front,
setting the focus (should it follow the mouse a la X?), and so on.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id509435"></a>Subject: Better thread control</h4></div></div></div><p>Is threading an app in the BeOS harder than it needs to be? A number of
complaints and feature requests were offered, but one in particular,
how to simulate Amiga "signals", stimulated the most discussion. Is it
credible to use <code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code> (with a count) to unblock all the
threads that are waiting for a particular semaphore? An alternative
(<code class="function">suspend_thread()</code>/<code class="function">resume_thread()</code>) was suggested as a better way to
toggle a thread's activity.

discussed. Jon Watte of Metrowerks wrote in to assure our listeners
that the library IS thread safe.

Some folks have noticed
that the swap file seems to swell to a rather hefty weight quite
quickly and then stay there, never shrinking. Is this necessary? or is
the file wasting space?
</p><p>THE BE LINE: Indeed, the swap file gets too big too fast. In DR9, you
should see some improvement.

instance of a <code class="classname">BWindow</code> subclass that wants to fully define itself (i.e.,
it doesn't want to pass arguments to the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> constructor). This
lead to an announcement that Be will provide object archiving in DR9.

Soft Modem?</h4></div></div></div><p>The thread started out by musing on the feasibility of a software modem
that uses the analog audio IO as its communication path. This led to
reminiscences of DSP modems promised and fulfilled, as well as thoughts
on alternative (or purposefully mismatched) signal paths; for example,
would it be possible to broadcast software as an FM RF signal which
could be recorded and then "played"? (The claim is that this has been
done.)

Most of the suggestions begged for greater
preference-style control—of windows, sliders, text tabs, and so on.
Also, there was a minor debate on the proper way to store and display
timestamps (the consensus: store them as GMT, and then offset them to
the local time zone for display).
