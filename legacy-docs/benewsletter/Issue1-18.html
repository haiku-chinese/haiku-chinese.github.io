One of the integral parts of the BEOS—perhaps its cleverest element— is
the application server. The server is designed to take full advantage of
the multi-threaded kernel; the glory of the design is manifest as a
superbly efficient and responsive user interface. But even more than by
its exploitation of threads, the server gains speed and efficiency by
communicating directly with the driver that controls the graphics card.
The application server links with the graphics card driver in its own
address space, thus allowing direct access to the driver without the
overhead imposed by system calls.
</p><p>
In the next release of the Be OS (release 1.1d7), we will publish an API
through which you can create your own graphics drivers to support the
card of your choice. By using the new driver API (which was described by
Robert Herold in Issue 1-14 of this newsletter), you will be able to load
your driver into the application server, thus allowing the same direct
server/driver communication that Be provides with its own drivers.
</p><p>
This first version of the graphics driver API supports all the main
accelerated functions needed by our 2D application interface system. The
resolutions that we will (ultimately) support are
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>640 x 480</li><li>800 x 600</li><li>1024 x 768</li><li>1280 x 1024 (not currently available)</li><li>1600 x 1200 (not currently available)</li></ul><p>
The depths are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>8 bits (256 indexed colors out of RGB 6-6-6)</li><li>16 bits (RGB 5-5-5, not currently available)</li><li>32 bits (RGB 8-8-8 and an 8 bit alpha channel).</li></ul><p>
As even the minimal resolution/depth uses almost 300K of bandwidth, we
chose to support only those cards that provide linear addressing and a
good bus bandwidth. Consequently, we only support PCI graphic cards—ISA
cards are definitely too slow.
</p><p>
We decided to integrate high-precision refresh rate and synchronization
settings to allow the best possible use of your monitor's capabilities.
With a few minutes of real-time, interactive tests (using the new Screen
preferences), you can get your monitor to display an unexpectedly high
resolution. There's no trick here—when you approach the maximum refresh
rate supported by a monitor, it becomes incredibly sensitive to any
synchronization problems. Since you can adjust the settings in real time,
you can quickly see what works and what doesn't. For example, we got
800x600 out of an old fourteen inch monitor in two minutes. By
comparison, the complete version of Windows 95 failed after a half hour
of automatic testing and another half hour with the help of the user.
</p><p>
Be will also provide, in release 1.1d7, some of our own new graphics
drivers (look at the Web Site for an up-to-date list). If the number of
drivers that we provide seems a bit skimpy, remember the following:
</p><p>
The Be Machine isn't Intel
</p><p>
This obvious remark might seem unrelated to graphics drivers—but
actually, it's the key to everything. The incestuous relationship between
card manufacturers and Microsoft engenders a deceptively simple view of
the graphics world. Why do you think PC cards areas "easy" to install as
they are today? Because tens (more probably hundreds) of engineers from
graphics card companies are working closely with Microsoft to provide
"seamless" cooperation. Have you
ever noticed that every SuperVGA card comes with a ROM (and not a small
one)? That ROM represents the brain trust, the collective hard-wired
wisdom of those hundreds of engineers. But just try porting to the thing.
</p><p>
The BeBox doesn't execute Intel 386 code (we're still studying emulation
solution, especially to get a minimal mode for the boot, but it's not
easy, and really not efficient). And we don't have access to their source
code—but, admittedly, we haven't asked. So we need to redo everything
from scratch.
</p><p>
I've asked a few friends, all software engineers, “<span class="quote">What do you think do
we have to do to initialize a graphic card ?</span>” Most of them replied: “<span class="quote">You
put the resolution in a first register, the depth in a second, the
refresh rate in a third, something like that...</span>”
</p><p>
It's a reasonable answer—but in the reality, there's something like 60
to 100 registers involved in the initialization of superVGA mode. Every
time you turn on your TV, consider what it would be like if, instead of
an on/off switch, channel selector, and volume dial, you had to set the
parameters that control the light beam, the synchronization signals, the
frequency of the channel, the vertical blanking, and tens of other
parameters that are meaningless—except to the engineer who designed it.
You'd probably watch less TV.
</p><p>
The task of designing a graphics driver depends, largely, on the quality
of the information provided by the manufacturers of the chips used on the
card. In a few cases, they provide examples of complete settings (God
bless them !). Most of the time, however, you have only a description of
each register. In the worst cases, there are mistakes in the databook
that takes hours, days, or weeks to uncover. Some manufacturers don't
provide databooks at all (Matrox, example Matrox).
</p><p>
Not to be discouraged, things get better; the initial, lost-in-the-forest
part of designing a driver for a graphics card is by far the worst part
of playing around with graphics. After that comes the fun stuff: Multiple
monitor support, game architecture, 3D strategies. But we'll save all
that for the next versions of the drivers and another newsletter.

“<span class="quote">Simple, clean, fast...</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Getting in on the ground floor.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">An opportunity to change the world like the Macintosh did a decade ago.</span>”
</p><p>
Phrases like these pop up regularly when we ask Be developers why they're
developing for the BeBox, and what their future hopes are for the
platform. Michele Fuortes of Leuca Software says, “<span class="quote">I hope the BeBox
becomes the Macintosh of the next millennium.</span>” Nicely put. We can almost
see the tag line on a full-page Wall Street Journal ad...
</p><p>
Fuortes' current product, Macjordomo (not related to the famous UNIX
program Majordomo), is a freeware Macintosh list server, which he expects
to make available on the BeBox by late 1996. Macjordomo is used primarily
in the education market, which isn't surprising, given that Fuortes is an
assistant professor of Anatomy and Cell Biology at Cornell University
Medical College. But Macjordomo isn't just a tool for research students.
Michele reports that many “<span class="quote">regular folks</span>” are using Macjordomo, from
fiction writers, to Northwest plant lovers, to church groups.
</p><p>
He writes his software in his spare time and distributes it
free-of-charge because he wants to help people take advantage of the
Internet, and “<span class="quote">for the pure pleasure of seeing the programs run well and
seeing people use them.</span>”
</p><p>
For communications programs like his, Fuortes sees the clear advantages
the BeBox provides. “<span class="quote">With an integrated, object-oriented OS; real
multitasking, multithreading, and memory protection—it's a powerful
box.</span>” If he had five seconds to describe the BeBox? “<span class="quote">The power of UNIX
with a Macintosh interface.</span>”
</p><p>
Fuortes' BeBox development plans include an email client program that is
currently in the design phase. Also on the drawing board: a reference
manager for scientists that can tap the speed and processing power of the
BeBox. The program will make it easy for a scientists and science
students to search for specific topics in journals, articles, and books.
</p><p>
As a freeware developer, Fuortes isn't overly concerned with a platform's
installed base. Still, when the topic of low-volume platforms comes up,
he likes to remind people, “<span class="quote">Bill Gates started small.</span>”

Why do we keep targeting the PC clone organ bank? Because that's where
the goodies are. The hardware goodies, that is. As luck and Bill Gates
would have it, fairly soon there will be better building blocks in it for
us.
</p><p>
Last week, at WINHEC 96 (Windows Hardware Engineering Conference), in San
Jose, Microsoft announced its support for a number of industry
initiatives, some of which are of great interest to us. Specifically USB
and IEEE 1394—a.k.a. FireWire for the Apple connected.
</p><p>
But first, let's marvel at the juxtaposition of Windows and Hardware
Engineering. Years ago, IBM lost control of the PC platform. The efforts
to regain proprietary command of the PC standard with PS/2 and OS/2 were
not met with great success. The IBM PC/AT, instead, became the de facto
standard and grew almost organically without anyone formally at the helm.
Buses came and went: We had EISA (too expensive), VESA or VLB (too
specific), and finally settled for PCI and the old PC/AT bus, renamed ISA
in honor of the industry taking it away from IBM. Creative Labs surprised
everyone, including themselves, I hear, by creating the SoundBlaster
standard. Today, you can buy an Intel motherboard with a Creative Labs
chip on it. (Sound remains one of the messier areas of the organ bank,
one we rely on the least)
</p><p>
Speaking of Intel, by building more than microprocessors and chipsets,
but also motherboards and even complete systems, the company put itself
in a very nice position to control the hardware part of the PC platform.
In the process, they coopted firms like Creative and S3 (for SVGA
graphics). But imagine a new processor or motherboard that doesn't run
Windows. Who would blink first? Hence WINHEC 96.
</p><p>
Of course, Microsoft doesn't have to bless USB and IEEE 1394. One can and
will write drivers for devices using these standards, but it helps to
know that the support will be there.
</p><p>
Both new standards are borne out of a frustration with the current
methods of connecting peripherals. There is also the recognition of a
market limit. For personal computers to become more pervasive, especially
in homes, the task of connecting peripherals—be they classical ones
such as printers and modems, or new ones such as DVD players or digital
video cameras—must be made less complex. Otherwise, opportunities are
lost for everyone.
</p><p>
Today, Plug and Play works ... almost. On my Fall 1995 Intel motherboard
P&amp;P finds two mice, including a non-existent PS/2 mouse, and needs to be
goaded into binding the sound hardware to the OS. To be fair, many other
instances, such as connecting communications hardware, work very nicely.
</p><p>
But P&amp;P is just a good hack, while USB and 1394 are designed solutions.
The Universal Serial Bus will connect the lower speed devices such as
modems, printers, and scanners, while IEEE 1394, with speeds up to 400
Mb/s, will do nicely for hard disks, DVD players, and video cameras. More
than speed, these connectivity standards offer self-configuration and hot
connect and disconnect. The system will recognize that you've plugged in
an ISDN adapter (a sore point these days), or your video camera, and will
configure itself accordingly. True plug and play. Thus at last offering
consumers an experience as simple as the proverbial toaster: A computer
you never have to open. (Well, maybe for a little memory to run the
latest software upgrade.)
</p><p>
To us, it means the industry will produce chips that support USB and IEEE
1394, and peripherals that use these standards. Anything that helps
connectivity and lowers prices because of wider market acceptance is a
boon to us. Especially for high-speed digital media and communications
applications where the BeOS shines.
</p><p>
When? Not a great deal will happen this year. Intel is already offering
USB parts and Comdex will see many vendors showing off new hardware
supporting both new standards. Digital video cameras are still expensive
and only two offer Firewire connectivity; DVD players are not yet
available. As always, the brochures look sharp while the reality of the
implementation is more gradual. A book published by Microsoft in 1985 --
"The New Papyrus," if memory serves—described the future as belonging
to the CD-ROM. But eight years later, only half of all personal computers
included a CD-ROM player
</p><p>
This time, I believe the change will be more rapid because, contrary to
the CD-ROM, the industry doesn't need to generate a new genre of content
for these connectivity standards to take hold. On our side, we're happily
readying ourselves for another raid on the bank.
