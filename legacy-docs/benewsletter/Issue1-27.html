The engineers at Be have had the luxury of writing a new operating system
from scratch. We've worked hard to make it as good as possible. Still,
you might feel that you can write a better one, or that some other
ancient OS is more suited to your taste. In the spirit of open, friendly
competition, this article will describe how you can get control of a
BeBox so you can boot your own operating system.
</p><p>
Before you start hacking away, you may want to get the data books
describing the major components of the BeBox hardware. These books are
listed at the end of this article.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id486198"></a>Getting Loaded</h3></div></div></div><p>
To get control of the machine, you replace our kernel with yours. The
kernel must be on a Be-formatted volume on a hard disk, floppy disk, or
CD-ROM. The boot ROM looks for the PEF executable file "system/kernel",
loads it at location 0x3100, and jumps to the __start entry point. (In
the future we expect to support a more flexible bootstrap, with volume
partitioning, alternate file system types, and perhaps boot blocks. For
now we're Be-centric.)
</p><p>
The kernel file loaded by the boot ROM should be statically linked, i.e.,
it shouldn't depend on any shared libraries. With the proper settings,
you can use the Metrowerks IDE on either the BeBox or the Macintosh to
generate such a beast.
</p><p>
The kernel should be prepared to accept both processors at the same time.
As a model, the Be kernel parks one processor in a polling loop until the
other one has initialized the kernel.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id486231"></a>System State</h3></div></div></div><p>
Most of the hardware devices in the system are in an unpredictable state
when the kernel gets control. The only given is that RAM has been set up
contiguously starting at address zero (0x0). The processors are running
in "real mode" (MMU off), with interrupts disabled (EE bit cleared in the
MSR). R2 is set up with the kernel's TOC pointer, so kernel globals may
be accessed immediately. The kernel is responsible for initializing the
rest of the hardware in an orderly fashion.
</p><p>
Some useful information is placed in low memory by the boot ROM for the
kernel:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>0x3010</td><td>RAM size, in bytes</td></tr><tr><td>0x301C</td><td>Pointer to a null-terminated "list of stuff" passed to the kernel</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
In the "list of stuff" you'll find bootitem structures:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
typedef struct <span class="type">bootitem</span> {
   struct <span class="type">bootitem  *</span><code class="varname">next</code>;   <span class="comment">/* -&gt; next item, or null */</span>
   <span class="type">char</span>             *<code class="varname">name</code>;   <span class="comment">/* -&gt; item name */</span>
   <span class="type">int</span>              <code class="varname">size</code>;    <span class="comment">/* item size */</span>
   <span class="type">void</span>             *<code class="varname">data</code>;   <span class="comment">/* -&gt; item data */</span>
} <span class="type">bootitem</span>;
</pre><p>
You can scan this list to look for a particular named data item. Items
defined to date are:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>"pci_table_v5"</td><td>pci_info</td><td>PCI device table</td></tr><tr><td>"boot_config_dev"</td><td>char*</td><td>Configured boot device name</td></tr><tr><td>"boot_kernel_dev"</td><td>char*</td><td>Where boot ROM found kernel</td></tr><tr><td>"boot_kernel_name"</td><td>char*</td><td>Name of booted kernel</td></tr><tr><td>"boot_ignore"</td><td>bool</td><td>Flag: mount only kernel vol</td></tr><tr><td>"boot_kvol_only"</td><td>bool</td><td>Flag: check only kvol for a bootable system</td></tr><tr><td>"debug_output"</td><td>bool</td><td>SERIAL4 debug enabled flag</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The <span class="type">pci_table_v5</span> is quite important. The boot ROM must relocate all PCI
devices to make each one accessible. This item is a table of structures,
one per device, that give the final device location and other useful
information.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id486553"></a>Hardware Memory Map</h3></div></div></div><p>
The MPC105 defines the physical memory map of the system as follows:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Start</th><th>Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0x00000000</td><td>0x40000000</td><td>Physical RAM</td></tr><tr><td>0x40000000</td><td>0x40000000</td><td>Other system memory (motherboard glue regs)</td></tr><tr><td>0x80000000</td><td>0x00800000</td><td>ISA I/O</td></tr><tr><td>0x81000000</td><td>0x3E800000</td><td>PCI I/O</td></tr><tr><td>0xBFFFFFF0</td><td>0x00000010</td><td>PCI/ISA interrupt acknowledge</td></tr><tr><td>0xC0000000</td><td>0x3F000000</td><td>PCI memory</td></tr><tr><td>0xFF000000</td><td>0x01000000</td><td>ROM/flash</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The standard ISA hardware device registers are at the standard offsets
within the ISA I/O space. The keyboard is at 0x80000060 and 0x80000064,
SERIAL 1 is at 0x800003F8-0x800003FF, etc. The Be-specific ISA hardware
(sound, <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™, infrared, extra serial ports) are also in ISA
space. Describing their hardware interface is a future newsletter topic.
</p><p>
The boot ROM maps all the PCI devices into the PCI I/O and memory spaces.
See the "PCI Local Bus Specification" and the "Device Kit" chapter of
"The Be Book" for details.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id486742"></a>Be Motherboard Registers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Five 32-bit registers are implemented in glue logic on the BeBox. These
registers handle interrupt identification, masking and routing, as well
as interprocessor interrupts, processor resets, and processor
identification.
</p><p>
All five registers use an unusual mechanism where individual bits can be
changed in a single write (a nice feature for a multiprocessor system).
On a write, bit zero (Power PC style numbering, i.e., the most
significant bit) controls whether other bits are set to one or zero.
Other bits control whether the register bit is written or left unchanged.
For instance, writing 0x90008000 sets bits 3 and 16, leaving others
unchanged. Writing 0x08040200 clears bits 4, 13, and 22, leaving others
unchanged.
</p><p>
The register locations are:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>0x7ffff0f0</td><td>CPU 0 interrupt mask</td></tr><tr><td>0x7ffff1f0</td><td>CPU 1 interrupt mask</td></tr><tr><td>0x7ffff2f0</td><td>Interrupt sources</td></tr><tr><td>0x7ffff3f0</td><td>Cross-processor interrupts, processor ID</td></tr><tr><td>0x7ffff4f0</td><td>Processor resets, other stuff</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The interrupt source register has a bit for every interrupt source. If
the bit is one, the device is asserting its interrupt line. The two
interrupt mask registers control which CPU gets each interrupt. If the
CPU 0 mask bit is set, CPU 0 gets it. If the CPU 1 mask bit is set, CPU 1
gets it. Setting both bits is not covered under your warranty.
</p><p>
The two mask registers and the source register have the same layout:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Bit#</th><th>Interrupt Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>(Used for setting/clearing mask registers)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>(CPU 0 mask reg only) SMI interrupt to CPU 0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>(CPU 1 mask reg only) SMI interrupt to CPU 1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Not used</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>IRQ4, a/k/a SERIAL1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>IRQ3, a/k/a SERIAL2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>SERIAL3</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>SERIAL4</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>MIDI1</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>MIDI2</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>SCSI</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>PCI slot 1</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>PCI slot 2</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>PCI slot 3</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Sound</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>IRQ1, a/k/a Keyboard</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>IRQ8, a/k/a Real-Time Clock</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>IRQ5</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>IRQ6, a/k/a Floppy Disk</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>IRQ7, a/k/a Parallel Port</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>IRQ9</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>IRQ10</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>IRQ11</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>IRQ12, a/k/a Mouse</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>IRQ14, a/k/a IDE</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>IRQ15</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>8259 (ISA-compatible interrupt controller)</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Infrared Controller</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>A2D Converter</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>GeekPort</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Not used</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Not used</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The cross-processor interrupt register (0x7ffff3f0) has the following
layout:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Bit#</th><th>Interrupt Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>(Used for setting/clearing individual bits)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0 - deassert /SMI to CPU 0, 1 - assert it</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0 - deassert /SMI to CPU 1, 1 - assert it</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Not used</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0 - assert /TLBISYNC to CPU 0, 1 - deassert it</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0 - assert /TLBISYNC to CPU 1, 1 - deassert it</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>(Read only) 0 if read by CPU 0, 1 if read by CPU 1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The processor resets register (0x7ffff4f0) has the following layout:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Bit#</th><th>Interrupt Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>(Used for setting/clearing individual bits)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0 - assert /SRESET to CPU 1, 1 - deassert it</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0 - assert /HRESET to CPU 1, 1 - deassert it</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>FLUSHREQ workaround (see below)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>not used</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>not used</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>not used</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>disk LED (0 - off, 1 - on)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The FLUSHREQ workaround fixes a problem we encountered using the Intel
PCI-ISA bridge (the 82378) together with the Motorola host-PCI bridge
(the MPC105). If connected as specified in the data books, DMA cycles
from the floppy controller could hang when other ISA interrupts are
pending (until another read or write to ISA I/O space is done).
</p><p>
The FLUSHREQ/MEMACK functionality is not needed in our system, so we
simply looped the FLUSHREQ output to the MEMACK input on the 82378.
However, this caused ISA interrupt acknowledge cycles to hang! Therefore
we temporarily reconnect FLUSHREQ and MEMACK between the two parts when
running an ISA interrupt acknowledge cycle, then change it back
afterwards.
</p><p>
The FLUSHREQ workaround bit should normally be zero, except when running
an ISA interrupt acknowledge cycle.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id487559"></a>A Word About Interrupt Controllers</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are two interrupt controllers in the BeBox. The Be interrupt
controller is described above. One of the inputs to the Be controller is
the output of the 8259-compatible standard ISA interrupt controller
that's embedded in the Intel 2378 SIO chip.
</p><p>
Interrupt lines from the ISA slots and standard ISA devices are connected
to both interrupt controllers. Edge-triggered interrupts should be
handled in the ISA controller, and level-triggered interrupts should be
handled in the Be controller. Setting up both interrupt controllers to
handle the same interrupt is not advised.
</p><p>
When possible, interrupts should be handled with the Be controller where
they can be directly identified and dispatched. Interrupts in the ISA
controller require many (slow) ISA I/O accesses to identify and
acknowledge the interrupt, and a second level of dispatching to get to an
interrupt handler.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id487592"></a>In Conclusion</h3></div></div></div><p>
Hopefully this article has swamped you with enough detail to discourage
you from writing anything better than what we can come up with. Seriously
though, we would like the BeBox to be open to all comers, even other
operating systems—a Linux port is already up and running! For the
lunatic fringe, getting control of the entire machine is the ideal
environment. Happy OS hacking!

Charles G. Fleming, director of software development at Night Owl
Software in Saegertown, Pennsylvania, isn't afraid of new technology. The
small software shop has been in business since 1989 developing for
emerging platforms such as NEXTSTEP/OpenStep and Newton.
</p><p>
Night Owl's current products include a NEXTSTEP device driver for Nikon's
Coolscan 35mm slide scanner, and a NEXTSTEP Interface Builder palette
that provides objects that communicate with Mathematica. Night Owl mostly
serves the higher education market, with incremental sales to business
and scientific customers.
</p><p>
Now they're looking to the BeBox. Night Owl has had a BeBox in house
since late December. “<span class="quote">The BeBox has the potential to be a great virtual
reality development environment,</span>” says Charles. “<span class="quote">With the DR7 release and
the full CodeWarrior development tools, we're finding programming it more
enjoyable than ever.</span>”
</p><p>
Night Owl's plans to build BeBox development tools similar to those
produced by NeXT. “<span class="quote">For rapid prototyping, we believe the BeBox needs a
tool similar to NeXT's Interface Builder,</span>” Charles says. “<span class="quote">We already have
a prototype for in-house use.</span>”
</p><p>
After that, Night Owl plans to focus its BeBox development on the
educational market, possibly in art and modern languages. For example, an
artist at Allegheny College is currently investigating "Interface Art" --
works of art constructed from common interface widgets. Since the artist
is an Amiga programmer, Night Owl is looking at the possibility of
steering the artist toward the BeBox. “<span class="quote">We see an opportunity to attract
former educational Amiga users.</span>”
</p><p>
For more information on Night Owl Software, send e-mail to Charles at
cfleming@alleg.edu.

As we grow and make the transition from a group of engineers developing
hardware and software to a real business with shipping products, we
experience problems and, unfortunately, we ship some of them. For this,
I'd like to extend our apologies to our developers and thank them for
their patience and feedback.
</p><p>
Last fall, we were surprised and more than a little overwhelmed by the
reaction to the first public showing of the BeBox at the Agenda PC
industry conference. Our web site was swamped, we got hundreds of
developer applications, and we managed to ship over a hundred development
systems. The motherboards came from Altatron, our manufacturing
contractor in Milpitas, and each BeBox was assembled by hand in our
offices. The front bezel was missing, the loud color scheme got equally
loud reviews but, overall, we didn't experience any unusual hardware or
software problems. The venture community was watching this and the warm
reception, and this external validation played a crucial role in our
getting serious financing.
</p><p>
As with many a start-up company, we had several good looks at the whites
of the repo man's eyes. One of these "extreme cash conservation" episodes
occurred in the two-to-three-month period preceding the close of our
financing. As a result, we stopped manufacturing units for a while, thus
creating frustrations in the developer community and the unfortunately
accurate perception of availability problems. Once our financing closed,
we ordered parts, restarted production of motherboards, and signed on a
contractor for final assembly, test, pack, and shipment. On paper it
looks good: A lighter infrastructure, outsourcing, flexibility. As we all
found out, buzzwords don't make good processes. We got a bad batch of
sound chips, our shipping container didn't protect our chassis, and
miscellaneous other problems resulted in an abnormal number of bad
systems shipped to our developers. Some were damaged in shipment, some
were insufficiently tested to catch the sound problem before shipment.
And we got frustrated developers and a stain on our reputation at a time
when we ought to be happily focusing on going through our database of
registered developers with the good news that we have systems available.
Needless to say, we're mortified—but motivated. The good news is this
happened early in our life. We didn't create problems on a grand scale.
Better news is we got, shall we say, energetic, highly motivating
feedback from the technically proficient recipients of our mistakes. We
have a brand new Director of Manufacturing, Don Fotsch, assisted by Kevin
Peoples, also a new hire, and we're focused on the product design,
procurement, contractor management, and testing processes that led to
these problems. At the same time, we're cleaning up the situation in the
field—exchanging units or I/O boards as needed.
</p><p>
Now, we need to behave in a way that restores confidence and demonstrates
we've learned from these bad experiences. You'll be the judge.
