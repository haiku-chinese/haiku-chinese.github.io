BeOS drivers are allowed to open files, but there are a few reasons why
you don't want to do this to read settings. For one thing, if your driver
is loaded before the file system, you can't open your settings file. If
the boot volume's disk driver needs information from the settings file
before it can access the disk, just opening a file won't work. Also,
parsing settings files can be complicated by corrupt files, and a crash
in driver code is fatal.
</p><p>
The next BeOS release will have an API for drivers and kernel modules to
get settings. The API includes easy access to Boolean and string
settings, and is available for all drivers and modules. For complex
settings, a call is provided that returns the settings as a tree of
parameters and values. The boot loader reads the settings files from the
selected boot volume and passes them to the kernel for use by drivers.
The boot loader also lets the user append settings at boot time. A line
of the form "filename:parameters" in the advanced safemode menu will add
"parameters" to the end of the specified settings file. This can be used
to change debugging information, and to test different options on
hardware where the driver doesn't work. For beta testers, all this should
already work in 4.1b3.
</p><p>
The functions are defined as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="function">load_driver_settings</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">drivername</code>);

<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="function">unload_driver_settings</code>(<span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">handle</code>);

<span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="function">get_driver_parameter</code>(<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="parameter">handle</code>,
                                 <span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="parameter">keyname</code>,
                                 <span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="parameter">unknownvalue</code>,
                                 <span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="parameter">noargvalue</code>);

<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter</code>(<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="parameter">handle</code>,
                                  <span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="parameter">keyname</code>,
                                  <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">unknownvalue</code>,
                                  <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">noargvalue</code>);

<span class="type">const driver_settings*</span> <code class="function">get_driver_settings</code>(<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="parameter">handle</code>);
</pre><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="parameter">drivername</code> is the name of the settings file and should match the
name of the driver.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="parameter">handle</code> is the handle returned from load driver settings.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="parameter">keyname</code> is the parameter name to search for in the file.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="parameter">unknownvalue</code> is the value to return if the key is not found.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="parameter">noargvalue</code> is the value to return if the key is found but no value
is specified.
</p></li></ul><p>
A driver calls <code class="function">load_driver_settings()</code> with the name of
the settings file as the argument.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="varname">settingshandle</code> = <code class="function">load_driver_settings</code>(<code class="varname">drivername</code>);
</pre><p>
This returns a handle that is
passed to the other driver settings functions. The driver can look for
specific parameters by calling <code class="function">get_driver_parameter()</code>
and <code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter()</code>, or it can get a
pointer to the parsed settings from
<code class="function">get_driver_settings()</code>. When the settings have been
processed, <code class="function">unload_driver_settings()</code> will free the
resources.
</p><p>
Let's look a simple example first. A driver "sample1" has one
setting, "foo", that can be <code class="constant">true</code> or
<code class="constant">false</code>. To specify the value of "foo", a line
of form "foo value" is placed in the settings file. If there is
no entry for "foo" in the file, the default is
<code class="constant">false</code>; if there is an entry "foo" but no
value is specified, we assume the value is <code class="constant">true</code>. The
code for our example looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void *</span><code class="varname">settingshandle</code>;
<span class="type">bool</span> <code class="varname">foo</code>;
<code class="varname">settingshandle</code> = <code class="function">load_driver_settings</code>("sample1");

<code class="varname">foo</code> = <code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter</code>(<code class="varname">settingshandle</code>, "foo",
                                   <code class="constant">false</code>, <code class="constant">true</code>);

<code class="function">unload_driver_settings</code>(<code class="varname">settingshandle</code>);
</pre><p>
Now let's look at how this works. If there is no settings file named
"sample1" in
<code class="filename">~/config/settings/kernel/drivers/</code>, load driver settings will
return <code class="constant">NULL</code>. Since we pass <code class="constant">NULL</code> to
<code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter()</code> it will
return the value we specified for no entry: <code class="constant">false</code>. "foo" will therefore
be <code class="constant">false</code>.
</p><p>
If the file exists, but doesn't contain an entry "foo", the
result is the same. In this case, we get a valid handle and
<code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter()</code> will look for a
"foo" parameter in the file. Since the file doesn't contain
"foo", it returns <code class="constant">false</code> as requested.
</p><p>
If the file contains one line starting with "foo", the second
word in this line is used as the value. If no value is specified,
<code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter()</code> will return the last
argument passed. If a value is specified and is one of the strings
"1", "true", "yes", "on",
"enable", or "enabled", <code class="constant">true</code> will
be returned. If the value is "0", "false",
"no", "off", "disable", or
"disabled", <code class="constant">false</code> is returned. If the value
doesn't match any of these strings it is treated the same as if no entry
was found; in this case, <code class="constant">false</code>.
</p><p>
If more than one line in the file starts with "foo", the last one is
used. This allows the user to override settings from the boot loader.
</p><p>
Another simple case is when a driver has a string setting.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void *</span><code class="varname">settingshandle</code>;
<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="varname">string</code>;

<code class="varname">settingshandle</code> = <code class="function">load_driver_settings</code>("sample1");

<code class="varname">string</code> = <code class="function">get_driver_parameter</code>(<code class="varname">settingshandle</code>, "string",
                              <code class="constant">NULL</code>, "default");

<code class="function">unload_driver_settings</code>(<code class="varname">settingshandle</code>);
</pre><p>
This works the same way as <code class="function">get_driver_boolean_parameter()</code>, except that the
string value of string is returned instead of the logical value. If the
file doesn't exist, or exists but has no line starting with "string",
string will be <code class="constant">NULL</code>. If the last line starting with "string" has no
values, string will be "default". If string has a value, it is returned
as a string. Note that only one value is returned. If more than one value
is needed for a key, use <code class="function">get_driver_settings()</code> and search for your key.
</p><p>
For drivers that need complex settings, the <code class="function">get_driver_settings()</code> will
return the settings file as a tree. This tree allows a parameter to have
multiple values and subparameters.
</p><p>
The following structure holds the root of the tree.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
typedef <span class="type">struct driver_settings</span> {
    <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">parameter_count</code>;
    <span class="type">struct driver_parameter *</span><code class="varname">parameters</code>;
} <span class="type">driver_settings</span>;
</pre><p>
Each parameter is of the form:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
typedef <span class="type">struct driver_parameter</span> {
    <span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">name</code>;
    <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">value_count</code>;
    <span class="type">char **</span><code class="varname">values</code>;
    <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">parameter_count</code>;
    <span class="type">struct driver_parameter *</span><code class="varname">parameters</code>;
} <span class="type">driver_parameter</span>;
</pre><p>
The settings file follows these rules:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The file consists of parameters and comments.
</p></li><li><p>
When a word starting with a '#' character is found, the rest of the
line is treated as a comment.
</p></li><li><p>
A parameter can have values and subparameters. A parameter has the
following form in the settings file:
</p><pre class="screen">
name [value]* [{
[parameter]*
}] ['\n',',']
</pre><p>
( [] optional part, []* optional repeated part )
</p></li><li><p>
Names and values may not contain spaces unless they are preceded by a
'\' or enclosed in quotes.
</p></li></ul><p>
Here's an example that clarifies these points. For the file:
</p><pre class="screen">
device 0 {
    attribute1 value
    attribute2 value
}
device 1 {
    attribute1 value
}
</pre><p>
<code class="function">get_driver_settings()</code> will return a pointer to the following tree:
</p><pre class="screen">
driver settings = {
  parameter count = 2
  parameters = {
    {
      name = "device"
      value count = 1
      values = { "0" }
      parameter count = 2
      parameters = {
        {
          name = "attribute1"
          value count = 1
          values = "value"
          parameter count = 0
          parameters = NULL
        },
        {
          name = "attribute2"
          value count = 1
          values = "value"
          parameter count = 0
          parameters = NULL
        }
      }
    },
    {
      name = "device"
      value count = 1
      values = { "1" }
      parameter count = 1
      parameters = {
        {
          name = "attribute1"
          value count = 1
          values = "value"
          parameter count = 0
          parameters = NULL
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Our thanks to the developers who attended last weekend's BeDC. It was
great to meet you and to pass on our Media Kit knowledge to you. We
promised you some sample code RealSoonNow(tm) at the conference, so
here's the first delivery.
</p><p>
In the Node Track session, we presented a new class—the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> --
as a work in progress for the next release. This class helps manage the
events your node needs to handle. It's another virtual <code class="classname">BMediaNode</code>
subclass, so you can mix it with all the other classes: <code class="classname">BBufferConsumer</code>,
<code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code>, <code class="classname">BControllable</code>,
<code class="classname">BFileInterface</code>, and <code class="classname">TimeSource</code>. Unlike
these other classes, however, the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> doesn't define any new
services that your node must provide. Instead, it implements some basic
node necessities for you.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> services the node's control port with its
own thread. When <code class="classname">BMediaNode</code> messages come in, the
<code class="classname">MotherNode</code> pushes
events on to its <code class="classname">BTimedEventQueue</code>. In the
main loop the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> waits
for new messages until it's time to handle a new event. Then it pops the
event off the event queue and calls <code class="methodname">HandleEvent()</code> with it.
</p><p>
Subclasses of the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> will implement
<code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code> and other
time-related <code class="classname">BMediaNode</code> subclass hook functions (like
<code class="methodname">BBufferConsumer::ProducerDataStatus()</code>) to push events onto the event queue.
The subclass will also implement <code class="methodname">HandleEvent()</code> to do the actual work
required to make sure the event is handled properly (i.e., the real work
of the node).
</p><p>
You'll find the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code> class at
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media_kit/MotherNode.zip
</p><p>
This code is only of use to people with access to the current beta CD.
</p><p>
Finally, it is certain that the <code class="classname">MotherNode</code>'s functionality will find its
way into the final release under another name. However, the API should
stay pretty similar, so only minor code changes will be needed.

"I can't print."
</p><p>
These are words that strike fear in the hearts of many good men and women
in call centers all over the world, including some who are reading this
article right now. We are the knowledgeable and somewhat strained voices
on the far end of "the help line." We need a vacation and a fresh look at
humanity. We are tech support. Let's look at how the user got to us.
</p><p>
Some time in the past, your company—which consists of three developers
respectively titled VP of Development 1, VP of Development 2, and King --
encountered a situation they were not entirely prepared for. The company
just released Product, the coolest thing on the block, and made its first
sales. Finally! There is great rejoicing.
</p><p>
Then, John Q. Pedestrian, famous for not knowing the difference between
WALK and DON'T WALK, decides to buy your product. He pays his money,
takes home your software, and installs it. OK, so far. But then something
fails to happen exactly how, when, where, or why John expected. He sends
e-mail to your company:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
From:John Q. Pedestrian<br />
To:King@Product.com
</p><p>
I can't print.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The person who read the mail thinks, "What do you MEAN you can't print? I
spent weeks, months on this! It works fine here! We proved it! All our
testing works fine! What could possibly be wrong?"
</p><p>
Let me stop here and say that it's easy to blame the user. But remember,
John is a real person with family, friends, loved ones, a mortgage, a
driver's license *shudder*, and a job. John can balance a checkbook.
Sometimes he does his own taxes. He's had some college education. He's
not stupid. He may or may not know the available resources. He may not
speak your language. He may or may not have good communication skills.
He's stuck.
</p><p>
Your development team has suddenly become its own tech support. This is a
problem. It has to figure out what the company's users need, as well as
what they expect—and what the company expects of them. It must
determine what resources are available to meet users' needs and how to
deploy those resources.
</p><p>
As Be's Customer Technical Support (CTS) manager, figuring these things
out is my job. I make sure you can find the answers you need, and that
someone is there to supply the answers you can't find. And if other
support people can't help you, I'm the answer guy of last resort. My
experience for that role comes from having worked for the world's largest
supplier of outsourced technical support, on a variety of subcontracts
ranging from hardware and software to operating systems and appliances. I
know my share and have all the funny stories to prove it.
</p><p>
If you're interested in some background on technical support, one of the
best articles I've read was written for "MacWorld" magazine, by David
Pogue. He spent a day with Apple's support group just after it had
changed from free to fee-based support. Based on the kind of service
people were getting for the fee charged, he concluded that "... [Apple]
should charge twice that [amount]." (See
http://macworld.zdnet.com/pages/october.98/Column.4493.html.
</p><p>
So, why is support a problem?
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id779549"></a>Needs, Wants and, Expectations</h3></div></div></div><p>
What the user wants from a product is often unrealistic. For example,
that the product should work immediately and unconditionally, right out
of the box, without having to *gasp* read the manuals and instructions.
And should something fail, the guy on the other end of the phone should
be the one who wrote it, and can wave his magic wand and make it work
while releasing daily free updates. He wants unlimited free support on a
toll-free call. The developer wants people to buy the product and
register it, so they can be solicited to buy Product updates, and leave
the developer alone so he can write Product 2.0.
</p><p>
User expectations are a more realistic versions of wants: competent,
bug-free software; a warm, skilled body at the other end of the support
line; bug fixes as necessary; a route to request new features; and so on.
These can be tuned up or down depending on the cost of the product and
the size of the company.
</p><p>
Needs are an acceptable compromise between user wants and expectations,
and developer resources.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id779575"></a>Determining the Needs of Your Users</h3></div></div></div><p>
The easiest way to measure a company's support staffing needs is to see
how long it takes to respond to each contact. If a company is a week
behind on the support e-mail, or if it knows that users are getting busy
signals or 20-minute hold times, it's time to get some help. To decide
how to handles users' needs, let's look at common BeOS developer-sized
situations.
</p><p>
Joe Developer runs the Small Shareware Group Co. Your company is you, or
maybe you and a couple of friends. People want support for freeware; they
don't generally expect it, and they're happy to get it. If you have a
shareware or commercial product, you need at least one person responsible
for responding to users. Here are some tips:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Set a target turnaround time for your responses, like 1-2 days.
</p></li><li><p>
Send an auto reply to let users know you got their mail and you'll
get back to them within this time. The most damaging thing to your
company is to have an e-mail disappear into the void unanswered. It
happens, but do all you can to eliminate the possibility.
</p></li><li><p>
Notify users that you have an auto reply; if they don't get it, that
means you didn't receive their mail.
</p></li><li><p>
Set up a separate e-mail account or alias for the support mail, so
when someone goes on vacation or gets sick, another person can step in.
</p></li><li><p>
If you provide phone support, specify the hours.
</p></li><li><p>
Accustom people to contacting the support address rather than a
specific person, since a specific person may change jobs within the
company, or leave.
</p></li></ul><p>
Customers expect little when no money is involved, and are generally
forgiving. Once you charge however, expectations shift. Customers expect
support, updates, and other commercial software services, including
daytime phone support, e-mail support, and FAQs on a web site. People
want the ability to document requested features and report bugs. They
want updates to cure bugs and possibly add features, but they don't
usually expect them to come instantly.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id779658"></a>Mid-sized CommercialSoft</h3></div></div></div><p>
This situation postulates a loosely defined group of developers, support,
and operations people. Support technicians generally aren't the best paid
group; they'll often take the next best thing on short notice, and burn
out regularly, costing you time to find and train a new technician, time
away from other work, etc. You should consider getting quotes from
outsource support companies to see if it will better accommodate growth,
both in your support team and in your development team. If Product 3.0
takes off as you think it will, having a flexible support team in place
can make all the difference. Ask for some estimates on outsourced
support, so you can look at your current costs and make an informed
choice.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id779669"></a>Supplying Users' Needs</h3></div></div></div><p>
Once you've looked at where your needs and your customers' needs meet,
you have the options of indirect and direct support to supply them.
</p><p>
Indirect support includes <acronym class="acronym">FAQ</acronym>s, tips, manuals, faxback lines, etc. These
are directly available to the user, with no human contact required. This
is cheap, takes little time to put together, and any number of people can
use it at no additional cost to you. The more you spend here, the less
your other costs will be. Some general tips:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A good, responsive manual and FAQ will attract people who want
answers, and they'll look here before contacting a support person,
which is expensive. Build and regularly update your FAQs based on the
problems or questions you're most often contacted about.
</p></li><li><p>
Interactive troubleshooters or help files and symptom- to-problem
charts can be very useful.
</p></li><li><p>
Track all your customer contacts. By looking at the reasons users
call, you can use indirect support that will decrease the things you
hear about most, cutting your biggest support costs.
</p></li></ul><p>
Direct support can be by e-mail or phone. Consider that an average 20
minute phone call can cost about US $10-30; e-mail costs between 25% and
50% of that amount. On average, a technician can respond to three times
as much e-mail as phone calls. However, some people insist on using
phones, or are too impatient for e-mail. Depending on your needs, you can
decide what combination is best for your company. Miscommunications and
slow interaction times in e-mail can be a problem, but questions that
call for the same reply are much easier and cheaper for both the
developer and the user via e-mail than on the phone.
</p><p>
Who does the support also affects costs. There are generally three
possibilities here:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Development team. Currently most BeOS developers do this. It is the
most costly—not in dollars but in resource consumption. Time spent
dealing with customers takes away from time spent on development. It's
a necessary cost, however, since the alternative ultimately costs the
company more in public opinion.
</p></li><li><p>
In-house support. This is when a person/group inside the company is
dedicated to handling customers. Many companies do this because it
gives them tight control of information, quality, and staffing. This is
a lot of work and is generally expensive. It's important that in-house
support staff be both competent and dedicated, so that it's unnecessary
to replace and train people often. The technicians are generally well
paid and have quick access to the information they need. They stay with
the company a long time and are generally happy, which is apparent to
users. It's expensive if you have to constantly pay to train, hire, and
fire technicians to accommodate the swings of more and less user
contact, like updates versus the holidays.
</p></li><li><p>
Outsource support. In this case person/group outside the compan,
handles tech support. This is convenient and can be inexpensive,
especially when used in mass. For example, an in-house employee costs
the company a given amount of money per day no matter how many people
contact support. An outsource company that shares many resources with
other companies (phone lines, Internet connections, etc.) can offer
support at a discount, sometimes as much as 33% off. An outsource
service can provide many types of staffing, including dedicated
technicians, shared technicians (techs that answer many types of calls
each day), and dedicated groups of flexible size.
</p></li></ul><p>
The most common is a dedicated group on a pay-per-contact price. In this
situation, if there are a lot of questions in one month, the outsourcer
moves more people in (and trains them) as needed. If the calls drop by
50% the next month, the outsourcer moves people to other
responsibilities, until they're needed again. This cuts costs
considerably, though quality control and employee retention can still be
problem areas.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id779764"></a>Making a Choice</h3></div></div></div><p>
The best way to decide what you should do is by assessing your needs and
their potential costs. Tech support providers will be glad to write a
quote for you. If you're looking at in-house support, remember to include
computers, benefits, training time, phone lines and charges, office
space, etc. in the costs. If you have other questions, contact me and
I'll try to answer them.

But to get back to John Q. Pedestrian, his printing problem was a
proprietary software driven printer switchbox without BeOS equivalent
software, and he can now print. He got his answer within two days, and
he's happy as a clam. He disconnects the old 386 he stopped using and
buys future updates of your product and mentions how cool your company is
to his friends. Meanwhile, the technician sighs wearily and opens the
next e-mail...

I always feel nervous going to a developer conference, because we're
going to meet the people who literally make us. It may be obvious but
nonetheless bears repeating that an operating system has little or no
value by itself. Applications determine its value—hence the vital role
of software developers—and of events such as the BeDC. A developer
conference is an opportunity to give a progress report on our work. We
get vigorous feedback from people who are committed to the platform and,
in return, we offer them information and suggestions on how they can make
the best use of the APIs and development tools. And, of course, there are
the T-shirts.
</p><p>
That's more or less the script we followed at last weekend's event. By
all accounts, our opening act was a little flat—I know, I was part of
it—but the main part, the Media Kit sessions, got the good reviews,
much to our grateful delight. For this conference, we did some things
differently: we charged admission; and we focused on the Media Kit,
instead of addressing all aspects of the BeOS. We highlighted the Media
Kit because it is the key to the most important application space --
digital media—and it provides the tools to produce "tangible" (I
should probably say visible and audible) proofs of BeOS advantages.
</p><p>
The result was a happy, productive conference. Several attendees made
unsolicited comments about the usefulness of the session and the
productive use of their time. I even got the same feedback from a Be
engineer who's been immersed in other parts of our work. This is not to
say that we won't have general purpose conferences in the future, but for
the introduction of the Media Kit—the keystone of the BeOS edifice --
we wanted to ensure that its concepts and facilities were treated with
the attention its role in the BeOS architecture warrants.
</p><p>
At the beginning, I stated I was always nervous going to a developer's
conference, but I should have added I always enjoy these events and come
away more motivated than ever after meeting people who take our future in
their own hands. My thanks to them and to the Be team for making this
conference a success—and a great time for yours truly.
