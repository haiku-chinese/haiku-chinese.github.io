As I write this we have just passed the feature freeze milestone for BeOS
R4. Now the period of intense testing and bug fixing begins, culminating
in that joyful last minute drive to the local CD duplicators
(conveniently located just down the street from Baron and Dominic's
favorite watering hole and entertainment emporium).
</p><p>
One of the first things we do during this test period is to begin using
the new release for all our daily work. Therefore, I'm writing this
article on my freshly built copy of R4. I'll resist the temptation to
regale you with a list of all the wonderful new features in R4. Instead,
I'll devote the rest of this article to describing some fun you can have
with the BeOS and video capture while you wait for us to finish R4.
</p><p>
You can find a copy of the source code I'll be talking about (and the
application binaries themselves) at
</p><p>
http://www.sakoman.com/
</p><p>
First a warning. The low-level video API used in these demo apps
shouldn't be the basis for any commercial applications. It will be
deprecated with the next release. R4 will ship with a brand new media
kit; using its API will ensure your future happiness and prosperity. Of
course, we'll provide similar sample code for the new API!
</p><p>
You'll also need a video capture card. We support any of the
Bt848/Bt878/Bt879-based video capture cards from a number of different
manufacturers: Hauppauge, Intel, Miro, Diamond, Avermedia, US Robotics
(expect to spend $79-$129).
</p><p>
You'll find three applications in the distribution: a TV/video viewer
with full-screen capability, a still and motion video capture program,
and a simple "webcam." There's too much code to discuss in detail here,
so I'll keep the discussion at a fairly high level. The basic structure
of all three applications is similar, and consists of four basic building
blocks.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id739821"></a>The SourceWIndow class</h3></div></div></div><p>
<code class="classname">SourceWIndow</code> is a subclass of
<code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>. Its constructor looks like
this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">SourceWindow</code>( <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">frame</code>,
              <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>,
              <span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">device</code>,
              <span class="type"><code class="classname">BVideoImage</code> **</span><code class="parameter">captureRingBuffer</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>,
              <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">ringBufferCount</code> = 1,
              <span class="type">void **</span><code class="parameter">vbiBuffer</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>);
</pre><p>
Here's where the real work gets done. When constructed with none of its
optional parameters, this class creates a <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code> and displays the
captured video directly to the screen. The class handles window movement,
resizing (from 640x480 to 80x60), and colorspace/workspace changes with
no action required on the part of the parent. All controls for the class
are implemented with <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s and are constructed in a way that allows
you to directly set the <code class="classname">SourceWindow</code> as the target for your UI widget
messages: i.e., sliders for brightness and contrast; popup menus for
video sources and formats; text boxes for channel selection.
</p><p>
The optional parameters allow access to some of the more advanced
features of <code class="classname">SourceWIndow</code>. If you specify a capture ring buffer, the video
input is split into two streams. The F1 (odd) fields of the video stream
continue to be displayed in the <code class="classname">BDirectWIndow</code>, but the window size is now
limited to 320x240. The F2 (even) fields are captured in the specified
ring buffer. The image size and color space for the two streams are
independent. For example, the displayed image can be a resizable RGB32
image, and the captured image can be fixed at 352x240 YUV411. This
feature is used in both the video capture app and the webcam app. See the
source code for details.
</p><p>
The final optional parameter gives access to the portion of the video
signal dedicated to digital information services (closed captions,
teletext, Intercast). SourceWindow provides the raw samples of data
captured during the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of the video signal.
Decoding is left as an exercise for the programmer, though the TV viewing
app does demonstrate the capture of US closed captions.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id739958"></a>The ControlWindow Class</h3></div></div></div><p>
This class implements the UI for each of the applications using <code class="classname">BTabView</code>
and standard BeOS UI widgets. The hardware setup and video controls tab
views are the same for all three apps. Additional tab views are added as
appropriate for each application; i.e., still and motion capture tabs for
the grabber application, and configuration info for the webcam app.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id739979"></a>The Settings Class</h3></div></div></div><p>
Many thanks to Pavel Cisler for contributing this code. This class
handles saving and restoring user settings for the application controls
and preferences. The settings are stored as plain text in
<code class="filename">/boot/config/settings/bt848/settingsN</code> (again where N is 0 to 3, depending
on the number of capture cards you have in your system). All three
applications share the same settings files.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740000"></a>The Application Specific Code</h3></div></div></div><p>
The application-specific code is located in the same source file as the
application constructor. In the case of the TV app, the only
application-specific code is the closed caption decoder. This is
implemented as a separate thread that collects and decodes the closed
caption information contained in each video frame (at the blazingly fast
rate of 4 characters per frame, or 120 characters/sec). The closed
caption information is sent to a terminal window; it won't be seen unless
the application is run from a terminal command line. One could also
redirect the output to a file if interested in capturing the text of the
evening news or a favorite TV show.
</p><p>
The video capture application (grabber) implements the still frame
capture feature in its <code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code> function, in response to a button
push from the <code class="classname">ControlWindow</code>. This code uses the Translation Kit to save
the captured image. The motion capture feature is implemented as a
separate thread. We routinely capture uncompressed 352x240, 16-bit per
pixel images at 30 fps (along with the 44.1khz stereo audio) to an
inexpensive UltraDMA hard drive (about 5 Mbytes/sec sustained data rate).
The app currently saves in a simple raw format. This code provides a
simple example of how to get high throughput from the Be file system.
</p><p>
The webcam app is similar to the grabber app. The main difference is in
the code used to post the captured image to your web site. I used two
excellent network libraries authored by Be's own Howard Berkey. You can
pick up copies on BeWare at
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/beware/Development/Nettle.html<br />
http://www.be.com/beware/Network/Synchronizer.html
</p><p>
These libraries reduce the effort required to post a captured image to
the web to only eight lines of code:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">/* ftp the local file to our web site */</span>
    <code class="classname">FtpClient</code>   <code class="varname">ftp</code>;
    <code class="varname">ftp</code>.<code class="methodname">setPassive</code>(<code class="varname">fPassiveFtp</code>);
    if (<code class="varname">ftp</code>.<code class="methodname">connect</code>(<code class="varname">fServer</code>, <code class="varname">fLogin</code>, <code class="varname">fPassword</code>))  <span class="comment">// connect to server</span>
      if (<code class="varname">ftp</code>.<code class="methodname">cd</code>(<code class="varname">fDirectory</code>))   <span class="comment">// cd to desired directory</span>
        if (<code class="varname">ftp</code>.<code class="methodname">putFile</code>(<code class="varname">fFileName</code>, "temp"))   <span class="comment">// send file to server</span>
          if (<code class="varname">ftp</code>.<code class="methodname">moveFile</code>("temp",<code class="varname">fFileName</code>)) <span class="comment">// change to desired name</span>
                 break;
    <code class="methodname">Alert</code>("Ftp Connection failed!");
</pre><p>
We've set up a webcam using this app here at Be. You can sneak a peak at
what's going on in our lunch area (and other locations) by pointing your
browser to:
</p><p>
http://www.sakoman.com/codycam/
</p><p>
You may wonder why the app is called CodyCam. It's named for my
13-year-old son Cody, who worked here this summer as an unpaid QA intern.
He was the "project lead" in putting together the first webcam
implementation: a shell script that used the grabber application to
capture the image and the command line ftp program to send it to his web
site. We've upgraded his implementation to use the CodyCam app. It runs
24 hours a day—don't be suprised to see some of us sleeping on those
$10 couches between now and the R4 release!

When I talk to software companies I often ask, "Who is your customer?"
All too often I hear the answer, "Everybody," and I realize they haven't
thought this through. How much does it cost to market your product to
"everybody?" What advertising message do you craft that applies to
"everybody"?
</p><p>
So—here's an exercise in defining your customer narrowly, and what
that can lead to. First, I'll talk about how it helps lower your
marketing costs, then about how a clear customer definition affects
development issues and support.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740228"></a>A Thought Experiment</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let's start with a narrowly defined customer. Red plastic. Who do you
sell red plastic to? Everybody. Suppose that instead of making red
plastic products you make taillight covers for the 1994 Fort Taurus. Your
customer is owners of 1994 Ford Tauruses (with broken taillight covers).
Suppose that you want to let them know about your product.
</p><p>
There's a highway near Be which at many times of the day seems to have
most of the cars in California on it. What a great place to put a
billboard for your taillight covers! "Everybody" will see the ad! The
billboard company offers the really low price of one penny per car that
passes that billboard. Your ad will only cost you—let's see, one penny
times most of the cars in the world equals—around $100,000 a day.
</p><p>
Now suppose there's a turnoff to a highway that only 1994 model cars
drive on. The billboard company wants 5 cents per car here, but since
there are fewer cars the cost is only $50,000 a day. This is better
because the cars you aren't reaching aren't your buyers anyway.
</p><p>
At another turnoff for Fords only billboards cost 25 cents per car, and
at turnoff from there for Tauruses only the billboard charge is 75 cents
per car. You reach far fewer cars and pay maybe $1 per car, which seems
high compared to a penny for "everybody." To further complicate your
decision, there's a billboard just past Bob's Driving Range for Really
Bad Golfers where most of the golf balls are hit onto the highway, where
they break the—you guessed it—taillight covers! That billboard
costs $2.50 per car! Since every car is a potential buyer for your
taillight covers and none of the cars you've eliminated will ever be a
potential buyer, this is a much better place to advertise than on the
billboard that reached "everybody." You're now reaching all your
customers for around $2,500 instead of $100,000.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740268"></a>What Was the Point of That Overly Long Story?</h3></div></div></div><p>
This story illustrates how a narrow definition of your product makes
decisions about where to advertise and how much to spend easier. Instead
of selling taillight covers to everybody, we narrowed the customer down
to buyers of 1994 Ford Taurus taillight covers. When you think about how
you can narrow your own customer definition you'll discover that a number
of problems with development, marketing, and sales begin to answer
themselves.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740287"></a>Engineers Often Do It Backwards</h3></div></div></div><p>
Maybe I'm approaching this backwards—asking you to define your
customer after you already have a product. But in the software business
I've often seen technically oriented people come up with what they think
is a great product and only then look at the business realities. (I'm not
a marketing person making fun of engineers; I have my own BeMasters
award. I did it this way myself for too long. It was an expensive
lesson.) The reality is that to make money you have to serve the needs of
a particular bunch of customers—to fill a demand in a market. What
business types do is determine a market that needs to be served, analyze
of the market's financial structure, and then come up with a product that
meets those needs while grabbing enough revenue from those customers to
make a profit. But I see a lot of developers who already have the product
and are starting to figure out how to sell it.
</p><p>
[Now a BeOS plug—the BeOS is an excellent platform upon which to build
new products. See my article <a class="xref" href="Issue2-45.html#Marketing2-45" title="How to Make a Million Dollars Developing for the BeOS (No Kidding)">How to Make a Million Dollars Developing for the BeOS (No Kidding)</a>]
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740308"></a>Generic Word Processor</h3></div></div></div><p>
So you have a product—a generic word processor—and you need to find
customers. Your brother-in-law, who works in medical insurance and needs
lots of medical transcriptions done, is always complaining about his
generic word processor—it doesn't format the transcriptions correctly,
and has many other shortcomings. He'd pay three times what that generic
word processor costs because it would still save him money.
</p><p>
An idea forms. I have a generic word processor that I'm having trouble
selling even for a low price. I'm aware of a "market" for a specialized
word processor buyers would pay a lot for...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740333"></a>Falling Into Place</h3></div></div></div><p>
Narrowly defining your customer can clarify many marketing and
development questions. For example, with a generic word processor you
have the problem of reaching everyone who writes anything. But if your
product is a medical transcription word processor you start with a
clearer idea of who you need to reach and how to reach them. Development
issues come together, like defining a feature set. Sales channels start
to become apparent.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740352"></a>Reaching the Customer</h3></div></div></div><p>
With the medical transcription word processor as your product, does it
seem easier to figure out how to reach medical transcribers than
"everybody?" You can go to insurance companies and sales offices,
malpractice attorneys, hospitals, etc. What you need to do is easier to
understand as you narrow your definition of who the customer is.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740369"></a>Development Issues</h3></div></div></div><p>
If your customers are medical transcribers, what features do you want to
add? How about a medical spelling dictionary? Specialized formatting for
insurance company medical transcription documents? What kind of
documentation does the specific customer need?
</p><p>
Also, methodology for determining your product's feature set defines
itself. Unlike a product targeted at "everybody," it's easier to decide
on a good feature set for a product targeted to medical transcribers; you
observe them at work and ask what they think would improve their
productivity.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740393"></a>Expanding Your Efforts</h3></div></div></div><p>
Now that you've defined your customer narrowly, you may find that you
want to expand from the niche you've captured. This differs from your
original position of trying to market a generic word processor to
"everybody." For one thing, you might have found a steady revenue base to
finance the cost of developing the product further. You also have the
ability (and experience) to start marketing the expanded product to new
areas.

Many beginning developers we speak with wonder what porting their
application from Windows to BeOS entails. This article makes a start
towards answering that question. My goal is to illustrate some of the
differences between the popular Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library
for Windows and the BeOS API.
</p><p>
Since a developer workshop without sample code is like a kindergarten
classroom without Play Doh, I submit the following for you toddlers to
investigate:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/intro/doodle.zip
</p><p>
Doodle is essentially a rewrite of the infamous "Scribble" MFC tutorial
for the BeOS. It's a simple drawing application which supports common
application features such as file I/O, printing, toolbars, a most
recently used (MRU) file list, and multiple document views. It implements
most of the functionality of its Windows cousin.
</p><p>
Those of you who are familiar with the MFC library may want to compare
this code directly with the Scribble source code, available on the Visual
C++ CD-ROM. I've sprinkled comments across Doodle's code to note specific
comparisons between the BeOS API and the MFC library; you can browse
these by searching the source tree for the text "MFC NOTE." Even if
you're not a rabid Windows aficionado, however, you may still find some
things in the sample code useful, such as the document architecture and
toolbars.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740476"></a>Comparing the BeOS API to Windows: a First Look</h3></div></div></div><p>
The BeOS API presents a level of abstraction somewhere between the Win32
C-based API and the MFC library. Superficially, the BeOS API bears a
greater resemblance to the MFC library: it's primarily object oriented,
and many BeOS API classes are similar to their Microsoft counterparts
(BRect = CRect, BWindow = CWnd, BView = CView, etc.). However, the MFC
library provides many things beyond Windows operating system basics that
the BeOS API doesn't—such as standard command implementations, a
document management system, and dialog data exchange/validation. In this
sense, the BeOS API more closely resembles the Win32 API. (On the other
hand, the BeOS API does do a lot of stuff that the MFC library doesn't;
I'll cover some of these features below.)
</p><p>
I've written Doodle from scratch, without using third party libraries,
resource editors, or even Microsoft code. This way, you can see exactly
what the raw BeOS API gives you. Because the BeOS API is at a lower level
of abstraction, I've provided some of the functionality that's standard
with the MFC library. The amount of code you'll see in Doodle is
considerably more than the equivalent in the Scribble tutorial.
</p><p>
For the rest of the article I'll document specific design and behavioral
differences between the MFC library and the BeOS API that I encountered
while writing Doodle, from general issues to coding specifics.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740506"></a>Multithreading</h3></div></div></div><p>
One of the most critical differences between Windows and Be programming
is the threading model. In MFC, you can (and many applications often do)
get away with using only one thread: the main application thread, which
implements the main message loop that dispatches messages to all the
application's windows. While this simplifies development, it's
unsatisfactory for many applications, including media-based ones, because
each of your windows, views, and documents is competing for that one
thread's time. For example, a window in the background doing calculations
could prevent a window in the foreground from processing messages or
responding to user input. Multithreading allows these tasks to be
scheduled separately, so windows can operate smoothly and independently.
</p><p>
You can do multithreading in MFC, but you have to implement the different
threads yourself. Also, the maps the MFC library uses to translate
between Windows handles and MFC library objects are thread-local, making
it impossible to pass MFC library classes that use Windows resources
between threads. Instead, a thread has to pass the lower-level handle to
the other thread, which wraps a new MFC library object around it on the
other side.
</p><p>
The BeOS takes a different approach. Since each window you create runs in
its own thread, just about every Be application automatically takes
advantage of multiple threads. Unlike the MFC library, however, BeOS
objects have no problems being shared between threads, and many objects
even help you control access to them through built-in locking mechanisms.
</p><p>
In Doodle, this threading model adds some complexity to the system. One
of the big questions is what to do about the documents, which can be
associated with multiple window threads, and may want to do calculations
separately from each other and the other threads. To allow each document
to function as independently as possible, I decided to derive the
document class from BLooper, to make documents event- driven objects that
each run in their own thread, similar to an MFC user interface thread.
</p><p>
Such a multithreaded situation requires careful planning (or
debugging...) of communication between the document, window/view, and
application threads. I've chosen to have the document communicate with
the app and windows via asynchronous messages, whereas the windows and
application communicate with the document through locked, direct access.
Since the document won't need to lock the windows or application,
deadlocks are avoided.

There is no MDI analog in BeOS as there is in the MFC library, where the
main application window is a frame that encloses the document, or
"child," windows. Thus, porting MDI applications requires extra thought.
</p><p>
In writing Doodle and doing away with Scribble's frame window, I divided
the frame window responsibility among several objects. The application
became the natural receptacle for Window/Cascade and Window/Tile
commands; menus and menu handling moved into the child windows; and
toolbars were transformed into autonomous windows.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740576"></a>Messaging</h3></div></div></div><p>
Simply put, the built-in messaging mechanism in BeOS is much more
powerful than what the MFC library provides. Rather than being limited to
moldy WPARAM and LPARAM arguments, a message in BeOS is a powerful object
that packages any kind of data in a simple, structured format. BMessage
also supports scripting, two-way, and inter- application communication.
Given the extra capabilities of messages, it's a good idea to rethink
communication strategies in your application; many types of communication
can be rewritten using messaging in a much more succinct and elegant way.
</p><p>
Take, for example, the MRU file list in Doodle. I set up each MRU item in
the File menu with a message that is dispatched to the application
whenever the item is invoked. The message contains an entry_ref that
locates the file to open. These messages end up being processed in
exactly the same way that Tracker and File/Open entry references are
processed, so no extra coding is needed.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740597"></a>Modal Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>
As you would expect in a heavily multithreaded system, BeOS objects work
particularly well in asynchronous situations. The messaging system is a
big part of the reason. Instead of trying to access the data directly
from the modeless window, it's trivial to parcel the data into a BMessage
and dispatch that to the target instead. This helps eliminate unwanted
dependencies between the dialog and the recipient.
</p><p>
By comparison, modal dialogs are actually more complicated to code in
BeOS's multithreaded environment because not only does the user interface
have to limit your actions to the modal window, but the calling thread
has to block and wait for the modal dialog to finish. The BeOS handles
the modal UI behavior for you, but you have to implement the thread
synchronization yourself. For these reasons, and because modeless dialogs
are often more natural for the user, I generally prefer to use modeless
dialogs. Dialogs such as the File/Open dialog are implemented as modeless.
</p><p>
Still, there are some things that you're best off waiting for. In
File/Close, for instance, you want to make sure not to delete the window
or its associated document before the user has a chance to save the
document's data. This means that the File/Save dialog needs to behave
modally. In case you do need to implement modal dialogs, Doodle's Pen
Widths dialog serves as an example.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740628"></a>Graphics Architecture</h3></div></div></div><p>
Although, unlike many BeOS applications, Doodle's drawing tasks are very
simple, it's enough to demonstrate that the BeOS graphics architecture is
more streamlined and versatile than its MFC library counterpart. For
example:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Views know how to draw themselves, and don't rely on an ephemeral
device context for rendering. (However, in order to draw they must be
attached to a window or bitmap.)
</p></li><li><p>
The BeOS coordinate system is <span class="type">float</span>ing point-based, supporting
subpixel precision and hassle-free scaling.
</p></li><li><p>
The BeOS's concept of mapping modes is a bit different from the MFC
library. By default, the BeOS works in a typographical mapping mode where
1 unit translates to 1 pixel on the screen, or 1 point (= 20 twips = 1/72
inch) on the printed page. It differs slightly from the MFC direct
mapping modes because the y axis points down. For printing in Doodle, I
perform an isotropic scaling on the <code class="classname">BView</code> to emulate Scribble's mapping
mode of MM_LOENGLISH (1 unit = .01 in.) on the printed page.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740681"></a>Resources</h3></div></div></div><p>
The only thing I use resources for in Doodle is to store simple
application data such as signature, icons, and acceptable MIME types.
These are easy to add to a resource file through the FileTypes preference
panel. However, you'll notice that the stuff you would normally put into
a Windows resource, like dialog layouts, menus, accelerators, and
toolbars, has been coded by hand in Doodle. The BeOS's resource format is
certainly capable of handling these kinds of data, but there's no
standard way of editing or using those resources in an application.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740692"></a>The Registry</h3></div></div></div><p>
Say good-bye to RegEdit—love it or hate it, in BeOS, you won't be
needing it. You can access the MIME-based BeOS application roster through
the FileTypes preference panel, or query it programmatically through
<code class="classname">BRoster</code> and <code class="classname">BMimeType</code>.
There's also a directory in the system set aside
for storing application-wide settings
(<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/settings</code>). Doodle
uses this area to store the entries in the MRU file list.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740722"></a>Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>
Analogous to the MFC library's capabilities for serialization and
structured storage, BeOS offers two classes for managing persistent data:
<code class="classname">BFlattenable</code> (if you like serializing from
streams), or <code class="classname">BArchivable</code>
(which uses a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> to store the data). Because Doodle doesn't need
any particular control over how the data is written in the file, and the
items being stored are standard types which <code class="classname">BMessage</code> supports, I used
<code class="classname">BArchivable</code> in the implementation.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id740758"></a>Conclusion</h3></div></div></div><p>
I've covered a lot of significant differences between the Be Way of doing
things, and that Other Way. If you look further, however, you'll realize
that I've only scratched the surface of comparisons between BeOS and
Windows development. I've left some important areas for future
columnists: graphics, audio/video/image manipulation, the file system,
the add-on/linked library architecture, embedded objects, memory
management... the list goes on. Though MFC and the BeOS API may look
similar, the BeOS API is definitely a different animal.

In the past few weeks, there's been an unusual amount of media
speculation regarding a change in the Wintel alliance. Not surprisingly,
we've been asked what we think of all this and how it affects our future
in the x-86 world.
</p><p>
The interest in the matter is understandable—a tremendous amount of
energy is stored in the bond between Microsoft and Intel. Intel people,
by the way, resent the term "Wintel." They refer to it as a typo, and
they don't like having their company name mangled. With a name like Be,
we have some sympathy for their position.
</p><p>
As to the energy stored in the bond, consider the following scenario. On
the right, a Pentium processor. On the left, a processor of identical
computing capabilities, power consumption, and cost, but which doesn't
run Windows software. Which processor will sell for more?
</p><p>
A tremendous amount of profits, shareholder value, and billions of
dollars are "stored" in the bond between Windows and Intel x-86
processors. I use the x-86 expression with intent and, in explaining my
intent, I should refine my use of "Windows." I should write "Windows 9x,"
because this is the only strain of Windows that is so firmly bonded to
the x-86 processors. Windows NT runs on other processors (MIPS and
Alpha). As for the PowerPC, Windows NT ran on it, although I don't know
if the latest release still does or if future versions will.
</p><p>
When the hardware independence of Windows NT was first announced, there
was much speculation about a diminished role for Intel processors and, as
a consequence, about a better future for competing architectures.
Instead, the Pentium took the lion's share of NT systems. With the
benefit of hindsight, we can appreciate the weight of binary
compatibility with the huge portfolio of Windows "classic" applications.
Windows NT might have been hardware independent, but the legacy of
Windows applications wasn't.
</p><p>
For the sake of completeness, various solutions exist to run x-86
application binaries on Windows NT systems (or Unix, for that matter)
based on other processors, but slower performance and other complications
prevented such arrangements from becoming mainstream. The result is that
Windows NT appears firmly bonded to Intel processors, for the time being.
It's not yet clear what will happen with NT 5.0, especially if a
"consumer version" of NT becomes the successor to Windows 98.
</p><p>
Windows CE presents a different situation. If anything, it isn't seen at
all on x-86 processors. There might be technical and business reasons for
this: power consumption and price. Perhaps, but the fact remains, and
many have seen it as yet another potential fracture in the
Intel-Microsoft alliance.
</p><p>
On the other hand, Intel appears intent on using the ARM processors for
consumer-oriented embedded applications, a segment from which it has been
absent. This could involve Windows CE, or Wind River Systems, a company
Intel is allied with. Wind River makes the highly respected VxWorks: one
of its many claims to fame is providing the software platform for the
Mars Pathfinder vehicle.
</p><p>
But the most visible agent of change appears to be Linux. Recently,
Oracle committed itself to this increasingly popular version of Unix. Not
to be left behind, IBM has announced the availability of DB2 products on
Linux. This is, of course, yet another phase of the Unix vs. NT struggle
for enterprise applications.
</p><p>
Whether or not Intel saw it coming, reacted to this, or had reasons of
their own, I won't speculate. What remains is that Intel, through a
number of executive pronouncements, has declared itself in favor of
Linux. Hence the speculation about a fracture in the historic bond
between Microsoft and Intel. Allegedly, one very senior executive stated
something to the effect Microsoft software ran on other processors and
Intel ought to support several operating systems.
</p><p>
This leads us to the unavoidable question: How does all this affect us? I
wish I could predict in detail where this is going but, in general, I
view it as a positive development—with some caveats. One qualification
is the role Linux plays in the marketplace. As mentioned above, this
concerns the Windows NT vs. Unix battle for enterprise applications. Over
time, through the good work of the Linux community, Linux has become a
credible Unix alternative, not just to NT, but to the "captive" versions
of Unix offered by players such as Sun, HP, and others.
</p><p>
An "unshackled" version of Unix is attractive to Oracle in its struggle
against Microsoft. In Oracle's mind, if Windows NT becomes the sole
enterprise applications platform, over time, Microsoft will leverage
ownership of the OS into dominating the enterprise segments Oracle today
derives its profits from. IBM probably follows a similar line of
reasoning.
</p><p>
We are not in the battle to become an alternative to Windows NT in
enterprise applications. Our goal is to coexist with, rather than replace
the general-purpose Windows 98, to complement it in media-rich
applications where its office-productivity roots prevent it from making
the best use of the underlying hardware.
</p><p>
Another caveat lies in the phrase "credible Unix alternative." We're not
attempting a better implementation of an existing OS, and we have more to
do and to prove in order to achieve the same level of credibility that
Linux now enjoys. The upcoming Release 4 of the BeOS will be an
opportunity to make serious progress in that direction.
</p><p>
In a world where the dominant belief is that we are confined to a one-OS
space, it's difficult to make our more ecumenical case. As you can
imagine, we welcome the shift in common wisdom the success of Linux has
brought. An interesting question remains: What will happen to the energy
stored in the (ambi)valence bond?
