It's 4:00 a.m. and my plane leaves for Germany in three and a half hours.
Soon I'll be guzzling hearty German lager, squeezing hearty German damen,
and eating hearty German bockwurst. But first, I have to write this
article.
</p><p>
But what to write about? Sometimes it's easy to find a topic, like when
we have a release right around the corner. In those magical times,
engineers <span class="type">float</span> through the halls of Be, on waves of pure platform
viability. We compete in naked hacking tournaments for the honor of being
the next to write a Newsletter article about all the cool stuff we're
giving you in Just A Few Days.
</p><p>
This is not one of those times.
</p><p>
Now, don't get me wrong. There's a lot to talk about already in the
coming attractions for R4. But as our fearless leader would say, we
wouldn't want that to come prematurely.
</p><p>
So, I was stuck, and had plane to catch—soon. It all seemed hopeless
until Pierre suggested I dig around in my copious archives of Stuff for
some sample code, and cheat by using that.
</p><p>
And, hey! I found a little program I'd been using to test scaled bitmap
drawing while I was rewriting that code. I decided that if I spent an
hour or so prettying it up, it would serve as sample code and you guys
probably wouldn't even be able to tell I was copping out. So this is a
little app which I have dubbed, with utmost originality and a nod to our
friends at Apple, <span class="application">QuickPaint</span>:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/graphics/obsolete/QuickPaint.zip
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id714393"></a>QuickPaint</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let me warn you: QuickPaint is not long on features, but it has great
simplicity going for it. I think it's a good example of how much a Be app
can do with very little code, and still be well-architected and
extensible. The line count, including headers, is a little over a
thousand.
</p><p>
What's interesting about it? For one thing, it demonstrates a simple yet
extensible document/view architecture using BMessages. It allows you to
open any number of windows onto a single bitmap "document," make
modifications in any of those windows, and have all the views of that
document be updated in real-time.
</p><p>
The idea is simple: the document keeps a list of editors, and notifies
them (via BMessages) any time the bitmap changes, with data about what
has changed. The editors receive the messages and update their displays.
Each editor can display the data any way it wants; in this case, each
editor has its own scaling.
</p><p>
To try this out, launch QuickPaint and select "Open new view" from the
View menu. Do this as many times as you want. Put them all over the
screen, and use Alt/Command-(plus) and Alt/Command-(minus) to get
different scaling levels. Then chose a color and a tool from the ToolBox
window and draw in one of the windows. Your interaction is scaled to
match the pixels in the window you are editing in, and all the other
views are updated immediately.
</p><p>
Other than that, you'll notice that each tool is a BHandler and the
ToolBox maintains a BLooper which multiplexes between them, depending on
the current tool selection. The current tool is simply the
PreferredHandler of the BLooper.
</p><p>
Finally, there is read-only/read-write locking done on the bitmap, to
make sure that nobody is blitting the bitmap while a tool is writing in
it. This is necessary because messages can arrive at editors at any time,
and we don't want bad updates happening. However, making it a
read-only/read-write lock (i.e., many readers, one writer) means that
many editors can handle updates simultaneously. Only the drawing tools
need exclusive access to the bitmap.

Some exercises for the reader, for those of you who feel like playing
with the code:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Implement the Open/Save/Save As menu options. This should be very
simple using the Translation Kit, and would add very little code.
</p></li><li><p>
Make the tools plug-ins, using add-ons.
</p></li><li><p>
Implement a Bezier tool.
</p></li><li><p>
Implement a text tool.
</p></li><li><p>
Right now, the tools get confused if the window moves or changes
scaling while you're in the middle of using one. Make them handle this
case correctly.
</p></li><li><p>
Ship it!
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Happy coding, and don't worry...I'll let you know all the dirt in my next
article.

This week we have a simple introduction into a topic that most BeOS users
and developers will find familiar: the query. Even if you've never looked
at the programming behind the scenes, most everyone has used the
<span class="application">Tracker</span>'s <span class="guimenuitem">Find</span>
menu item to do a search of their hard drive. The file
system query is what's behind this search.
</p><p>
A query asks the file system for a list of entries that satisfy certain
criteria. These include standard file system information (such as name,
size and modification date of a given file) and file system attributes. A
query must contain either one of the standard file system information
fields, or an attribute that has been indexed.
</p><p>
If you need more information on attributes and attribute indexing, please
look at the following Newsletter articles:

A static query is a one-time snapshot of files on a disk that met the
specified criteria at the time the query was made. Depending on other
activity on the machine, the list of matching items can change by the
time you receive it, and you must be prepared in case that happens. Next
week we'll delve into the more complicated issue of live queries and node
monitoring to make sure your list remains up to date. This week's article
provides the foundation for that even more interesting discussion.
</p><p>
Let's examine the make-up of <span class="application">QueryApp</span>,
the sample code provided with this
article. It can be found at:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/storage_kit/QueryApp.zip
</p><p>
<span class="application">QueryApp</span> is very straightforward, and somewhat limited. All the
interesting work is done by the <code class="classname">QueryWindow</code> class. This provides an
interface that allows the developer to search the drive the application
is on for folders, source code, or files (non-folders) that have a
certain case-sensitive string in their names. The query string that was
built is displayed, along with the paths of matching entries.
</p><p>
The BeOS has two interfaces for creating static queries: a straight C
function-based interface, and the more common (and flexible) <code class="classname">BQuery</code>
class. <span class="application">QueryApp</span> demonstrates both
methods, and allows the user to choose
the underlying method (to demonstrate that both provide identical
results).
</p><p>
Let's begin by looking at the implementation from <code class="methodname">FetchC()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">QueryWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">FetchC</code>()

   }

        <code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">entry</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">ref</code>);
        if (<code class="varname">entry</code>.<code class="methodname">InitCheck</code>() == <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
          <code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>;
          <code class="varname">entry</code>.<code class="methodname">GetPath</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">path</code>);
          if (<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">InitCheck</code>() == <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
             <span class="type"><code class="classname">BStringItem</code> *</span><code class="varname">item</code> = new <code class="classname">BStringItem</code>(<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Path</code>());

          }
        }
     }
     <code class="function">fs_close_query</code>(<code class="varname">query</code>);
   }
}
</pre><p>
As you can see, the C interface to queries is simple. A query token is
returned to you through a call to <code class="function">fs_open_query()</code>. You specify the volume
you want to search, and a query string that defines the search
parameters. Then you retrieve successive dirent pointers from the query
using <code class="function">fs_read_query()</code>. This represents an entry that matches the criteria.
</p><p>
Next you use this dirent to create an entry_ref, which you use to go
through the standard progression to the path that you want. This path is
then added to the list of paths. Note that we are careful checking the
status of our entry. It's possible that by the time the entry is created,
the resource doesn't exist there anymore.
</p><p>
While this is not as important in this case, where we simply want the
path, it would be very important to catch a failure in the transformation
process if the actual data of the entry needed to be accessed (say
through a <code class="classname">BFile</code> or a <code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code>).
When <code class="function">fs_read_query()</code> returns <code class="constant">NULL</code>, there
are no more matches or an error has taken place. We break from our loop
and make sure to close the query with <code class="function">fs_close_query()</code>.

The C++ interface through the <code class="classname">BQuery</code> class is a little more user
friendly. For starters, the class gives you two ways to define the query,
through a text string like the C Interface (using <code class="methodname">BQuery::SetPredicate()</code>)
and through a postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) stack of operations. Take
a look at the <code class="methodname">FetchQuery()</code> function to see its use:

     }
   }
}
</pre><p>
The postfix notation lets you push operations on to the stack. You first
specify the attribute you want to push with <code class="methodname">PushAttr()</code>. Next you define
the criteria you want to compare it against with the various PushType
functions (<code class="methodname">PushString()</code>, <code class="methodname">PushInt32()</code>,
<code class="methodname">PushFloat()</code>, and so on. Then you
define how to compare or combine those definitions with the <code class="methodname">PushOp()</code>
function. The Be Book describes this process in detail:
</p><p>
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BQuery_Overview.html">BQueryOverview.html</a>
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BQuery</code>s also are more flexible in how they present
matching entries to you. The C interface only allows the use of the
<span class="type">dirent</span> structure (through
<code class="methodname">FindNextDirent()</code>). This is fast, but requires some
work before you get reasonably useful objects. Like
<code class="classname">BDirectory</code> objects, <code class="classname">BQuery</code>s
also let you get ready made entry_refs or BEntry objects. In this case we
ask for the <code class="classname">BEntry</code> object we built in the C
functions, and after taking appropriate safety precautions, retrieve and
store each matching path.
</p><p>
The final bit of flexibility provided by the <code class="classname">BQuery</code> class is the ability
to create live queries. As mentioned earlier, live queries add additional
complexity to the query process. For that reason I'll continue next week
with a detailed look at keeping a query list in sync with an
ever-changing file system.

CompuServe is a wonderful worldwide local ISP—no contradiction in
terms. Just one local call in Tokyo, or Lausanne, or Paris, and I'm on
the Net. Yesterday—after a week's vacation (unwired) in Alsace—I
dialled up from Paris. Responsibly, before reading Ann Killion's
excellent World Cup columns on the Mercury Center, I checked Be's home
page and noted an energetic call to geeks of all backgrounds to come and
join Be. (The home page has since changed; for employment opportunities,
see http://www.be.com/aboutbe/jobs/index.html.)
</p><p>
This gives me the opportunity to comment on our recruitment philosophy.
We serve four main constituencies: BeOS applications developers;
customers who use BeOS applications; business partners—such as OEMs
and distributors—who use the BeOS and its applications to add value to
their own product and services; and shareholders who provide the company
with financial fuel and expect rewards commensurate with the degree of
risk they take. Shareholders include Be-ers who invest their time,
energy, skills, and experience in the venture.
</p><p>
Do individuals who join the company share common traits? Yes and no.
</p><p>
Let's skip quickly over the obvious. Different tasks require different
personality traits, different interests and experience. More relevant, we
like and need diversity. Not for reasons of political correctness (see
HR, below) but for effectiveness. A microcosm of diversity inside the
company enhances our effectiveness in connecting to diverse
constituencies.
</p><p>
Easier said than done. Scanning cultural backgrounds, we're a mini-UN,
representing countries from Croatia to Africa, China, Japan, UK, Serbia,
Belgium, France, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Italy,
Sweden, Czech Republic, and a few others I may be forgetting. Our
associates come from an interesting range of horizons, as befits the very
meritocratic Silicon Valley.
</p><p>
On gender, I'm not so sure—literally. It goes without saying that we
are an equal opportunity employer. Several women, such as Valerie Peyre
and Sylvie Pelaprat, have been promoted to positions of responsibility.
However, there's no denying that women are a numeric minority at Be.
</p><p>
How proactive we should be in filling more engineering, marketing, and
senior management positions with women is an open question for us and our
(female) recruiter Laurie Gamelsky. One of our directors, Heidi Roizen is
also very interested and proactive in this regard, and thinks the
industry in general excuses itself too easily by using statistics and
assuming there aren't enough female candidates.
</p><p>
Diversity aside, we have common goals and methods, and are looking for
related traits. In the first place, as we like to stay light on
management layers, we look for self-directed missiles. Once goals are
agreed, we prefer individuals who require less than the average amount of
guidance. Second, we like individuals who can keep the business as a
whole in perspective, regardless of their individual job description.
</p><p>
In other words, writing code or a Newsletter column or supporting
developers must always serve one or more of our constituencies. If the
activity doesn't do that, why undertake it? This isn't as obvious as it
sounds. What does or doesn't serve a constituency can lead to interesting
arguments. Which gives me a good transition to literacy.
</p><p>
Over time, we've found that the ability to express one's ideas well in
writing tends to correspond to a good fit with the organization, to the
ability to stay focused on our business goals. This may sound trite and
vague, a bit like the ideal employee being the proverbial 25-year-old
blond Japanese with 15 years' experience, but it's nonetheless proven to
be valid in practice.
</p><p>
Let me add that we have no HR department and don't plan to have one. We
believe management should manage without interference or excuse. We love
smooth and timely paperwork, 401K plans and dental coverage, which we
consider the province of personnel. HR activities, if and when required,
are the work of consultants who depart when they or we are done, leaving
behind only memories and a bill, but no self-perpetuating infrastructure.
</p><p>
Last but not least, we're looking for people who understand the
high-risk, high-reward nature of our work: building an OS and, more
importantly, an ecosystem around it to serve our key constituencies.

Is it possible to make a <code class="classname">BWindow</code> a "child"
of another <code class="classname">BWindow</code>? Adrian
Ziemkowski sites Photoshop as a precedent:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...their document windows are encapsulated by a psuedo workspace window.
It works just like a screen where you can drag a window partially out of
view...</span>”
</p><p>
Some folks were not half amused by the window-in-a-window feature, but
suggested that it could be done with <code class="classname">BView</code>s posing as windows. Right?
Nope—the opposition argued that the overlapping sibling prohibition
would thwart the effort. And speaking of overlapping siblings, why (it
was asked) is there this prohibition? Geoffrey Clements estimated with
some accuracy that it's much more efficient not to have to maintain
sibling order. But is the increased performance significant enough to
offset an obviously beneficial feature?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id715772"></a>Subject: Naming conventions</h4></div></div></div><p>
Grass roots movement, started by Luc Andre, to institute third-party
library naming conventions. Mr. Andre offered that the name should at
least include version and platform info; should it encode anything else?
Anybody have any good naming convention suggestions?
</p><p>
Marco Nelissen objected that Be already offers version info through the
FileTypes database. But for some, this isn't enough. They want the
version to be immediately apparent. "Get Info" (Alt-I) was Tyler Riti's
response. Mr. Riti also suggested that the loader present a friendlier
can't-run-on-this-lib message than "X is not an executable". Methods for
managing library versions, and recognizing (and possibly correcting)
incompatibility were thrown about:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Smart libraries that know how to download new version of themselves.
</p></li><li><p>
Single-entry-point libraries where all communication is done through
a single universal function name, so the library and the app will
always be able to negotiate despite incompatibility.
</p></li><li><p>
Take advanage of the library path: Install app-specific library
versions in the app's "lib" directory.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id715822"></a>Subject: State of App when Quitting</h4></div></div></div><p>
What's the cleanest way to get out of app land? Gerardo Diaz Cuellar
mentioned that he was getting an occasional main() crash on the way out
the door. “<span class="quote">Do I have to free anything special. Or do anything special.
Perhaps in QuitRequested?</span>”
</p><p>
The context of Mr. Cuellar's crash indicates problems in the heap—a
thorny problem since the app doesn't necessarily crash at the moment the
heap is corrupted, but sometime later. Not easy to debug, but, as Jon
Watte pointed out, “<span class="quote">some of these bugs can be found by running with
malloc debugging</span>”. Thus:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd /where/my/app/lives/
$ export MALLOC_DEBUG=true
$ ./MyApp
</pre><p>
As for the buggy code itself, look for the following:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Duplicate deletions.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">free()</code> on a bad pointer.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="function">free()</code> on an object, or delete on <code class="function">malloc()</code>'d memory.
</p></li><li><p>
Window deletion (the system deletes them for you).
</p></li></ul><p>
Failing investigation, try the "ain't-programming-swell?" method
(channeled by Michael D. Crawford):
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Copy your application to a new folder, and then delete, comment, or
#ifdef most of the code out. Then add back in a small amount of code...
Start simple and get your code working correctly with malloc debugging
before making the code more complicated.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id715916"></a>Subject: SWIG, the BeOS, and the need for subclassing</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is SWIG useful or even possible on BeOS?
</p><p>
-- Backgrounder Interruption
</p><p>
Are you SWIGnorant? Here's a blurb from the official SWIG Web site:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote"><acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> [Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator] is a program
development tool designed to make it easy to build scripting language
interfaces to C/C++ programs. Its primary audience is scientists,
engineers, and programmers who would like to build interactive C/C++
programs, but who would rather work on more interesting problems than
figuring out how to extend their favorite scripting language or using an
excessively complicated programming tool.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote"><acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> turns C/C++ declarations into a working scripting language
interface. C functions become commands, C variables become scripting-
language variables, and so on. By using ANSI C/C++ syntax, <acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> is easy
to use, requires no modification to underlying C code, and is relatively
simple to apply to existing applications.</span>”
</p><p>
For more info, visit http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/<acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym>/.
</p><p>
-- Back to our program
</p><p>
Ernest S. Tomlinson sees a fly in the <acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> ointment:
While <acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> uses off-the-shelf objects, the essential
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> and <code class="classname">BView</code>s are useful
only when subclassed. Could you work around this through clever
<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> use? In other words, could you
simulate a <code class="methodname">MouseDown()</code> implementation by trapping
the message in a <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>?
</p><p>
Jon Watte suggests that you simply put more books on the shelf:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">You can write your own subclasses of <code class="classname">BView</code>
and <code class="classname">BWindow</code> to use from C-based programs, which
turns all the virtual methods into function hook calls. Then run
<acronym class="acronym">SWIG</acronym> on those. That should not be very hard, although
slightly tedious.</span>”
</p><p>
Chris Herborth goes further in suggesting that you can subclass from the
underlying scripting language. He offered a Python example.
Unfortunately, it's all spec and mirrors right now.

Them pesky splash screens that appear when apps start up—what are they
good for?
</p><p>
Well...to display information, for one. And to reassure the user that all
is going well during initialization (if necessary), for another.
</p><p>
Should a startup panel be system-modal like on Windows? "No," cried the
millions. Quelle surprise. Everyone agrees that windows shouldn't pop to
the front unbidden.
</p><p>
Therefore, suggests Earl Malmrose, Be should provide API that let's you
<code class="methodname">Show()</code> a window without bringing it to the front.
