The human eye seems irresistibly drawn to moving images. Consequently,
every last scrap of system performance is inevitably drawn into the
pursuit of ever more appealing "eye-candy." This has made digital video
the black hole of computer applications—the application that absorbs
each new generation of technology and still is not sated.
</p><p>
The upcoming release of BeOS for Intel opens the doors to some
mouth-watering (or should I say eye-watering?) technologies. The
performance of 300+ MHz Pentium II MMX processors is nothing short of
astounding, but some of the less publicized technologies incorporated
into the "Intel Architecture" are proving to be equally exciting.
</p><p>
The competitive chipset market and Intel's devotion to visual computing
have resulted in a Darwinian process of selection that has produced
memory and PCI performance far beyond what we've seen on other platforms.
So-called "Write Combining" in the core logic allows dramatic
improvements in bandwidth to display memory, and thus, higher video frame
rates.
</p><p>
Offloading the graphics card bus traffic from PCI to the new AGP slot has
also been a major win in applications involving capture, processing, and
display of multiple video streams. The new Ultra-DMA IDE disk interface
allows us to capture 30 fps CIF (320 x 240 x 16 bpp) video images, along
with stereo audio directly to an inexpensive ($229) hard drive.
</p><p>
As you might expect, those of us working in the media area are pretty
excited by the doors that all this raw power opens. Our media technology
demos have gotten increasingly aggressive, and Alex, our VP of Sales and
Marketing, has learned not to leave the video demos running if he expects
to get any eye contact with his audience.
</p><p>
Developers are also excited by the possibilities they see in the video
area. I've noticed, however, that there seem to be a few common
conceptual "gotchas" that developers run into when they begin working
with video. This isn't surprising, considering that Zworykin developed
the first TV camera way back in 1937. Decisions that were sensible and
obvious back then seem a bit strange to a developer steeped in the world
of high-resolution, progressive-scan computer graphics.
</p><p>
So as you begin your adventures in video, keep in mind that the first
experimental television broadcasts began in 1941 and the first color
television appeared in 1953 (the year I was born)!
</p><p>
Most of the confusion for video beginners centers around the fact that
television signals are not "progressive scan" (like a computer monitor),
but "interlaced." What this means is that the display lines that make up
the image are not all drawn during each sweep of the screen. The odd
lines are drawn during the first sweep of the screen, and the even lines
during the next sweep. Note that line numbering starts at one (another
strange concept to us computer types). The image drawn by each of these
sweeps is called a field, the first referred to as F1 (sometimes called
the odd field), the next called F2 (or even field).
</p><p>
The most important thing to remember is that these two fields are samples
of the original image, which are taken at different points in space and
time. What this means in practice is that unless your image has no motion
in it, you *cannot* combine two fields to get a satisfactory still frame.
It's possible to do some serious image processing to minimize these
temporal artifacts, but this is not for the fainthearted.
</p><p>
Another surprise to many is the limited resolution of a video signal.
Standard broadcast NTSC has a horizontal resolution of about 330 image
elements, VHS video tape has about 240, and laser disk an amazing 400
image elements per line! ;-)
</p><p>
If you'd like to learn more about these issues, I'd recommend starting
with the following resources:

</p><p>
Chris Pirazzi doesn't work at SGI anymore, but his compilation of
"little known, undocumented knowledge that you need in order to write
any sort of video app" lives on. A great resource for learning about
the issues discussed above, with lots of pictures that explain the
concepts better than a text-based newsletter like this.

Searching for a topic for a Newsletter article, I came across an e-mail
from a Be Developer who wanted to know how to use Revision Control System
(RCS) with the <span class="application">BeIDE</span>. In response, I'll answer that question and also
touch briefly on other tools for source management that are currently
available for the BeOS. I'll follow up with a limited simple demo of
integrating a shell script with the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> to automatically save change
revisions to RCS.
</p><p>
Of the three source management tools currently available for the BeOS,
RCS is the most basic. In its plain vanilla form, without additional
tools, RCS is best suited for use by individuals or very small groups
because it does not have the ability to allow multiple engineers to make
edits to the same file. On the plus side, it's free, simple to use, and
ships with every BeOS CD. If you are not familiar with RCS, I recommend
starting with the rcsintro section in
file:///beos/documentation/shell%20tools/index.html for information.
</p><p>
The other two source management tools available for the BeOS are the
commercial software P4 from Perforce and the GNU-ported version of
Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Both are good choices as a source
management tool for handling large scale projects where sharing and
editing of files and information tracking are essential.
</p><p>
Perforce P4 software stands out: it's fast, has a rich feature set, and
its BeOS binary has been tested (very thoroughly ;-). On the plus side
for CVS, it is a good source management tool that can do the job as well
as P4, it's free, and the source code is available for hacking. At Be, we
use Perforce P4 as our source code management tool. We were extremely
impressed with its speed and reporting features, but the main reasons we
chose it was because it is supported software and has been ported to over
20 platforms, including our own PPC and Intel platforms. For more
information on Perforce P4 and its pricing, check out their website at .
General information about CVS can be found at
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System</a>.
The BeOS-specific version of
CVS was put together by the folks at Geek Gadgets; their website was at
http://www.ninemoons.com/GG/.
</p><p>
Before I go into the details of hacking together a script to work with
RCS and <span class="application">BeIDE</span>, you'll need to make sure that you have the ShellPlugin for
the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> installed in the plugins folder. Without the ShellPlugin, the
<span class="application">BeIDE</span> will not run shell scripts. You can find the ShellPlugins on the
Metrowerks BeOS CD. We do not ship the ShellPlugin on the BeOS CD.
</p><p>
To get the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> to know when to execute our script, we need to add the
following in the Target Prefs panel in the <span class="application">BeIDE</span>.
</p><pre class="screen">
File Type:  text/*
Extension:  psh
Tool Name:  sh
Flags:      Check the Postlink Stage and no resources
</pre><p>
We set the File Type to <span class="type">text/*</span> so that it will run a script which is
text. The Extension field tells the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> to run any file ending in <code class="filename">.psh</code>.
The Tool Name field specified with which tool to run the script. We set
the flag stage to Postlink because we want our shell script to run after
a successful link.
</p><p>
The new entry line should look something like this in the Target Prefs
panel:
</p><pre class="screen">
Filetype   Extension   MakeStage   Resources   ToolName
 text/*     .psh        4                       sh
</pre><p>
Cut between the two dotted lines below and paste into a text file named
<code class="filename">SaveToRCS.psh</code>. Add the file to your project. Edit
the variable <code class="envar">SRCHOME</code> to
be the path where your source directory is. Then do a make from the
project menu of the <span class="application">BeIDE</span>.
</p><p>
This script automatically saves to RCS any files that have changed since
the last successful link. This is not an ideal way to do source
management if you are doing a significant amount of editing and testing.
But it does demonstrate how you can tie RCS into the <span class="application">BeIDE</span>'s scripting
functionality to save change revisions.
</p><pre class="programlisting sh">

<span class="application">Tracker</span> add-ons allow a user to easily run a program on a set of files.
Many <span class="application">Tracker</span> add-ons have already been written, including the
ever-popular <span class="application">TermHire</span>, which opens a terminal window in the current
directory; and <span class="application">ZipMe</span>, which creates a ZIP archive of the selected files
and directories.
</p><p>
Any program can act as a <span class="application">Tracker</span> add-on if it exports the symbol
process_refs. In BeOS Release 3, the prototype for this function will be
found in <code class="filename">be/add-ons/tracker/TrackerAddOn.h</code>.
In the meantime, you can add the following lines to your source:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#pragma export on
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">process_refs</code>(<span class="type">entry_ref</span> <code class="parameter">dir_ref</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>, <span class="type">void *</span>);
#pragma export reset
</pre><p>
Once Release 3 is released, replace those lines with
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;be/add-ons/tracker/TrackerAddOn.h&gt;
</pre><p>
The prototype in the header file differs slightly from the PR2 form.
Under Release 3, the Tracker looks for the unmangled form of the name to
ease compatibility between the PPC and Intel versions. While the old form
will still work for PPC machines, it will not for Intel.
</p><p>
Now that the prototype has been declared, it's time to write the function
itself. <code class="function">process_refs</code> takes three arguments:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The first argument is an <span class="type">entry_ref</span> giving the current directory. If
the add-on was invoked from a <span class="application">Tracker</span> window, then this directory will
be the same as that of the window. If it was invoked from the desktop,
then the directory will be
<code class="filename">/boot/home/Desktop</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
The second argument is a <code class="constant">B_REFS_RECEIVED</code>
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> with the "refs"
field containing an array filled with the <span class="type">entry_ref</span>'s to the items
selected in the Tracker window.
</p></li><li><p>
The third argument is currently unused.
</p></li></ul><p>
Once you've written the application, drop it into
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/add-ons/Tracker</code>;
it should immediately appear in the
add-ons menu. If it doesn't show up, <code class="function">process_refs</code> was not exported
properly. Remember to compile with <code class="code">-export pragma</code> (or set Export Symbols
to use #pragma &gt; from the IDE).
</p><p>
The add-on runs in the <span class="application">Tracker</span>'s team. If your program dies, you can kiss
your <span class="application">Tracker</span> goodbye. At the same time, the add-on is perfectly capable
of acting as an application; all it needs to do is implement <code class="function">main()</code>. For
example, you could turn grep into an add-on that also can be run from the
command line.
</p><p>
A simple <span class="application">Tracker</span> add-on is shown below. It displays the current directory
as well as any selected files. It's also very ugly. You have been warned.

Before I jump into my main topic, a tip of our collective hat to our
friends at Adamation. Before an audience of professional cynics assembled
at this industry conference in Palm Springs, Stephen Adams and Mark Hall
demonstrated Home Studio, a personal video editing and compositing
application.
</p><p>
This was the first time a third-party BeOS application was featured at
this industry forum. Unlike other products shown earlier in the day, the
demo went flawlessly, was very well received, and the feedback in the
hallways was extremely positive, both on the application and the
underlying BeOS. We know what we have to do: Let's make sure we have a
festival of BeOS products at Demo 99.
</p><p>
Back to Demo 98, one session featured a bearded researcher telling us we
didn't understand the future of PCs. They are too complicated, the future
is appliances, PCs must become invisible. This reminded me of another
conference, Agenda, in October of last year. There, another industry sage
berated us for not seeing the consumer electronics industry was much
larger than the PC market, for not listening to consumers, for making
products too complicated.
</p><p>
For a while, I sat there feeling guilty. Yes, we're not paying enough
attention, we mindlessly pile features upon features, we fall in love
with technology. The guilt trip had been going on for a while when I woke
up with a start. I suddenly realized the vaticinating gentleman had no
experience whatsoever in anything even remotely connected to the consumer
electronics industry.
</p><p>
There is no need to reveal his identity since this isn't an ad hominem
argument; suffice it to say he had been the head of a software firm
providing highly technical design tools and had just joined another one
after briefly working for a prestigious and unfortunately misunderstood
financier. He and the bearded professor make a similar argument regarding
the faults and the future of the PC industry. And, in several respects,
they're right, as stipulated earlier.
</p><p>
But their politically correct discourse suffers from three defects. The
first one is what I call the diet problem, the second one could be called
the dirigiste mistake, and the last one is myopia.
</p><p>
Let's start with dieting. Everyone knows in order to lose weight one has
to exercise more and eat less, but no one really knows how to gain and
keep the resolve to permanently alter one's behavior. Don't tell me what,
tell me how. I'm struck by the fact that these critics and their many
brothers rarely offer concrete suggestions, a new UI design, or a new
product. Still, they play a useful role in reminding us of the dangers of
complacency.
</p><p>
The dirigiste problem reminds me of my country of birth where, without
even thinking twice, high-level civil servants suggest the creation of
free enterprise government programs and of clones of Silicon Valley. This
is the same delusion as decreeing desire—it doesn't work that way. Why
do these critics berate the PC industry for not seeing the big
opportunity? There is a free market out there, it creates competition
every day and big opportunities always attract big money. The free market
dealt with IBM and Digital, to name but two, when they ignored new life
forms.
</p><p>
Lastly, the appliances are right here under their very noses. WebTV Plus
(a very insightful review appeared in the February 3rd "New York Times")
is an excellent example of an appliance providing elegant simplicity of
installation and use in navigating the Web and TV broadcasts. Demo 98
also featured the CIDCO iPhone, a device combining Web browsing, e-mail,
and a telephone, the size of a full-featured set, for less than $500. I
heard many participants referring to computerphobe relatives who would
use such a device on their kitchen counter. Just like in the original
Macintosh brochures...
