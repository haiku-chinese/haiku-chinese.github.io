The Media Kit provides two audio streams. The ADC stream carries data
from the input source (line-in, CD, or microphone), and the DAC stream
carries data to line-out and the built-in speaker. If you're
experimenting with digital audio effects, then you may wish to connect
the input stream to the output stream so that you can hear what your
favorite audio CD sounds like when processed by your favorite audio
algorithm.
</p><p>
The Nino ("noise in/noise out") class is a simple test bed that connects
the two audio streams. A Nino object contains a pointer to a buffer, two
semaphores for controlling the stream functions, and two <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code>
objects, one for the ADC stream and one for the DAC stream:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">Nino</span> : <code class="classname">BObject</code>
{
  <code class="methodname">Nino</code> ();
  <code class="methodname">~Nino</code> ();

  <span class="type">char*</span> <code class="varname">buffer</code>;

  <span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">bufferReady</code>;
  <span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>;

  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code>*</span> <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>;
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code>*</span> <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>;
};
</pre><p>
The global "stream functions" are called
<code class="function">adc_reader()</code> and <code class="function">dac_writer()</code>.
Each stream function is called once per buffer. When <code class="function">adc_reader()</code> gets a
buffer, it releases the <code class="varname">bufferReady</code> semaphore and
waits for <code class="function">dac_writer()</code>
to release bufferUsed.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
static <span class="type">bool</span>
<code class="function">adc_reader</code> (<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="parameter">arg</code>, <span class="type">char*</span> <code class="parameter">adc_buf</code>, <span class="type">long</span> <code class="parameter">count</code>)
{
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">Nino</code>*</span> <code class="varname">my_nino</code> = (<span class="type"><code class="classname">Nino</code>*</span>) <code class="parameter">arg</code>;
  <code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">buffer</code> = <code class="parameter">adc_buf</code>;
  <code class="function">release_sem</code> (<code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">bufferReady</code>);
  <code class="function">acquire_sem</code> (<code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>);
  return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>;
}

static <span class="type">bool</span>
dac_writer (<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="parameter">arg</code>, <span class="type">char*</span> <code class="parameter">dac_buf</code>, <span class="type">long</span> <code class="parameter">count</code>)
{
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">Nino</code>*</span> <code class="varname">my_nino</code> = (<span class="type"><code class="classname">Nino</code>*</span>) <code class="parameter">arg</code>;
  <code class="function">acquire_sem</code> (<code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">bufferReady</code>);
  <code class="function">memcpy</code> (<code class="parameter">dac_buf</code>, <code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">buffer</code>, <code class="parameter">count</code>);
  <code class="function">release_sem</code> (<code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>);
  return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>;
}
</pre><p>
To simplify the example, these functions assume that both streams have
the same buffer size. Also, to avoid erasing the output of other DAC
stream subscribers, the call to <code class="function">memcpy()</code> should be replaced by a mixing
function: You should add the contents of <code class="varname">my_nino-&gt;buffer</code> into <code class="varname">dac_buf</code>
rather than simply clobbering the latter with the former.
</p><p>
The Nino constructor initializes the semaphores and subscribers and
enters the subscribers into their respective streams.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">Nino</code>::<code class="methodname">Nino</code>()
{
  <code class="varname">bufferReady</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code> (0, "buffer ready");
  <code class="varname">bufferUsed</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code> (0, "buffer used");

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code> = new <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> ("Nino ADC reader");
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code> = new <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> ("Nino DAC writer");

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Subscribe</code> (<code class="constant">B_ADC_STREAM</code>,
                            <code class="constant">B_SHARED_SUBSCRIBER_ID</code>,
                            <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Subscribe</code> (<code class="constant">B_DAC_STREAM</code>,
                            <code class="constant">B_SHARED_SUBSCRIBER_ID</code>,
                            <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">EnterStream</code> (<code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">FALSE</code>,
                              <code class="varname">this</code>, <code class="varname">adc_reader</code>,
                              <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">EnterStream</code> (<code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>,
                              <code class="varname">this</code>, <code class="varname">dac_writer</code>,
                              <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
}
</pre><p>
The Nino destructor must be careful to exit the stream, cleanly. It waits
for <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code> to exit before it deletes the semaphores, then it waits
for <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code> to exit before it deletes the subscribers.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">Nino</code>::<code class="methodname">~Nino</code>()
{
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ExitStream</code> (<code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
  <code class="function">delete_sem</code> (<code class="varname">bufferReady</code>);
  <code class="function">delete_sem</code> (<code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>);
  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ExitStream</code> (<code class="constant">TRUE</code>);

  delete <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>;
  delete <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>;
}
</pre><p>
When testing a Nino, remember to make sure that the <code class="constant">B_ADC_IN</code> and
<code class="constant">B_DAC_OUT</code> devices are enabled, and that <code class="constant">B_LOOPBACK</code> is disabled (See the
documentation for <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> in "The Be Book").
</p><p>
During the lifetime of a Nino object the ADC input stream will be fed to
the DAC output stream. This will make it easy to experiment with digital
processing of any audio source.

I completed a Bachelor of Science (Information Systems) at the University
of New South Wales in 1994. Since then I've moved into the banking and
finance industry, working as an analyst and programmer. (It's not as much
fun as software engineering, but the money is better.) Although I like
the business environment—there are a number of fringe benefits—I
hate the long hours. Mostly because this doesn't give me enough time to
develop my <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ applications.
</p><p>
From my brief experience with the BeBox, it seems that the BeOS is
significantly different from other operating systems I have used
(including AmigaOS and UNIX), in that the OS does a lot more for you.
This is something that you actually have to get used to. Normally—on
other platforms—you spend half your time setting up your program
environment (utility functions, code structures, and so on). With the
BeOS, on the other hand, a lot of the setting up is done for you,
allowing you to concentrate on what it is that you want your application
to do, such as formatting documents, creating sounds, and other functions.
</p><p>
Of course nothing's perfect, and there are, in my opinion, some
improvements to be made. For example, the interface is currently kinda
ugly (IMHO), and I'd really like more control objects (such as a
"BFuelGauge" object). Also, I'm a bit concerned by the fact that the OS
is "inspired" by the Mac—I've found that the Mac takes a very
simplistic view towards what functionality they need in the OS; I
wouldn't want this attitude to influence the design decisions that Be
makes.
</p><p>
But I can't argue much with the direction of the BeOS so far: It's new,
it's not Wintel, it's fun, and it's targeted at technically minded
people. The fact that I can have input into the design of BeOS, and that
it is being influenced by people all over the Internet is exciting.
</p><p>
My short term plan is to develop a system monitor program. It looks a bit
like a Browser window in "List View" mode, but instead of showing files,
it displays teams, threads, semaphores, and other system resources. It's
already working in basic form, but it needs some bells and whistles
before it's made public—this way I can learn more about the OS in the
process. My long term plan is to develop some Internet software, such as
an irc, ftp, or news client.
</p><p>
The system monitor should be available within two months, the next "big"
project should be in alpha or beta in less than six months.

Our demo port of the BeOS to the PowerMac was very well received at the
Macworld show in Boston last week. In our booth, we showed the port
running on an entry-level Power Computing PowerCenter 120, a 120 MHz 604
uniprocessor PowerMac clone. In their booth, Power Computing had the BeOS
running on a 200 MHz 604e uniprocessor machine. Both machines impressed
us—and the many visitors to the booths—with their performance
running the BeOS and with the stability and robustness of the port. Thus,
the decision to finish the port and commercialize it was an easy one.
We've had many questions from developers and users about BeOS on the
PowerMac, and I'll try to answer some of them here. In many cases, we
really haven't figured out the answers yet, so please bear with us as we
explore the possibilities more and gather feedback from our many friends,
partners, and customers.

Honestly, we don't know yet. We have to figure out the math. But we

This is very dependent on the level of documentation and support that
we receive from our friends at Power Computing, Apple, and other PowerMac
clone vendors; we've been delighted with the support we've received so
far. We'll be investigating as many Apple and PowerMac clone vendors'
machines as possible in the coming weeks and compiling a list of those we
think we'll be able to support. Initially, we're looking at 603 and 604
family machines. We've had requests for 601 machines, and we'll be
looking at that also.

That would be great, and we're looking into it. We'd love to support
PowerBooks or (yet-to-be) Mac-compatible laptops, but the challenges of

No. There are no new Macs or Mac compatibles based on the 68K

PowerPC-based machines and even Intel- based products. We've chosen to
use our limited resources on the higher performance PowerPC-based
machines.

Yes, we definitely plan to do this. No timescales yet, but we'd like

How does the performance of the BeOS on a PowerMac compare to its

</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
This is hard to judge objectively until we develop and run some
benchmarks. At first sight, it seems that the on- board video of the
Power Computing machines helps "snappiness" a lot. The uniprocessor
machines seem to saturate and degrade in performance more rapidly than
the MP BeBoxes; for example, a BeBox gradually slows down as you load it
up with multiple tasks, whereas a PowerMac "hits the wall" more suddenly.
But, these are just subjective views right now and need to be tested and
verified, so your mileage may vary.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id494487"></a><a id="id494489"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Is the BeOS running on top of the MacOS? Or vice versa?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Neither. In the demo version we used at Macworld, you boot up the
machine as normal running the MacOS. You then launch the BeOS, which
completely replaces the MacOS and runs from its own disk. The "end user"
version of the BeOS for PowerMac will probably offer a choice of which OS
to boot at startup time, from a disk partitioned for the MacOS or BeOS.

All good questions. We'll be investigating all of them.

Very high. Clearly, there's no <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™ on the PowerMac, nor are
there standard MIDI ports, IR ports, or multiple serial ports. Joysticks
are kind of tricky also. But, just about every application we had time to
try out seemed to work fine on both platforms. We still need to finish
the port, including a floppy driver, on-board networking, CD driver, and
so on, but we expect application binaries that run on the BeBox to run on
the PowerMac also, and vice versa.

Last week's Macworld Expo in Boston reminded me of the same show in
August 1985. At that time, Apple was in trouble: There had been turmoil
in the executive suite, the company had announced a big quarterly loss
and a layoff. The conventional wisdom was that Apple and the Mac were in
big trouble. The show floor didn't reflect any of that insight then.
Customers and developers were too busy doing business to inhale the
noxious predictions.
</p><p>
History doesn't quite repeat itself, but eleven years later the Boston
Macworld visitors and exhibitors were obviously oblivious of oracles of
obliteration. One might argue that only the faithful came to the show.
But that's always been the case, and they came in large numbers (50,000
we're told) and they were spending money.
</p><p>
One of the key differences this year was the strong presence of clone
makers, with Power Computing leading the pack. And not just in hardware
performance, but also in marketing presence. I'm not just referring to
their highly visible bungee-jumping crane, frequented by various members
of our team, or to the video wall in their crowded booth. Power Computing
machines were everywhere on the floor. The Apple Developer Greenhouse was
populated with Power Computing boxes—but not the Apple pavilion.
</p><p>
Speaking of Power Computing, the port of the BeOS on a Power Computing
system was well received, better than we expected. Because we had gone
through the BeOS port from the AT&amp;T Hobbit processor to the PowerPC, we
had proven our system to be portable. We even knew how portable it is --
very. Meaning its design made the task much easier than, say, porting
Windows 95. But that was internal knowledge.
</p><p>
Perhaps we made the classical mistake of assuming others knew what we
knew. In our industry, so many lofty claims have been made that
skepticism, polite or otherwise, has become the norm. Show me. And show
we did. At the last minute, we got one the newest 225 MHz Power Computing
machines, Bob Herold was able to make the required processor ID
modification and, voila, the BeOS ran on the fastest Mac clone available.
</p><p>
Removing the hardware variable simplifies the evaluation of our OS.
Before, one could look at our admittedly nonstandard multiprocessor
hardware and wonder if the perceived high performance wasn't due to some
undisclosed hardware advantage (other than the number of processors). On
the assumption that it's dangerous to develop software on hardware faster
than what customers will use, we deliberately picked the slowest member
of the PPC family for our first BeBox system, thus forcing us to watch
the efficiency of our code. This strategy worked for performance, but it
didn't sufficiently clarify its main source. Now you can see the Mac OS
and the BeOS on the same system. In one demonstration we prove both
portability and performance.
</p><p>
Still, we have a lot to do before the port becomes a commercial product.
First, we need to release it to Be developers for testing and comments.
Second, some functions remain to be implemented, such as the floppy
driver. Third, we need to evaluate which systems we can and should
support. In particular, we're getting many requests to support 601- based
machines (which is still being evaluated), and 68K Macs (which is
extremely unlikely). Once we have a stable product, supporting a
reasonable range of hardware, we can turn to the issue of distribution
and pricing. Hopefully, we'll be ready for the next Macworld in January
97 in San Francisco.
