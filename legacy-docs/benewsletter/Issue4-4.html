Every language, whether human or computer, has "idioms"; that is, a
common way of expressing a concept or thought. In American English, the
phrase "thanks a million" is a convenient way to express great thanks for
something. In the C programming language, the idiom
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
for(<code class="varname">ptr</code>=<code class="varname">head</code>; <code class="varname">ptr</code>; <code class="varname">ptr</code>=<code class="varname">ptr</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">next</code>)
  ...
</pre><p>
is a common way to iterate through a linked list. Cognizant listeners or
readers easily recognize both of these idioms. The nice thing about
idioms is that they don't require parsing the individual bits to
recognize the meaning of the whole. Idioms are a type of shorthand that
efficiently communicates an idea.
</p><p>
In writing device drivers one finds several common "idioms" for achieving
a particular result. In this article I'd like to cover some common device
driver idioms that BeOS device driver writers should know about. These
idioms are a bit more complex than phrases like "thanks a million" but
are still simple to recognize. This list is not exhaustive, but it should
cover the more common idiomatic expressions in driverspeak (a language
littered with hex constants, acronyms, bits, shifts, and bytes).
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id531635"></a>Starting Up</h3></div></div></div><p>
The first problem most device driver writers have is that they often want
only one person to be able to open their device at a time. I've often
seen the following code used to accomplish this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">static long</span> <code class="varname">open_count</code> = 0;

<code class="function">driver_open</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>, <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <span class="type">void **</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>)
{

  <code class="varname">open_count</code>++;
  if (<code class="varname">open_count</code> &gt; 1)
    return <code class="constant">EBUSY</code>;

  ...
}
</pre><p>
That is the code equivalent of an English speaker saying "what can I do
you for." It's just plain wrong. In this case the increment of <code class="varname">open_count</code>
is not atomic (in a multiprocessor environment an increment of <code class="varname">open_count</code>
could be lost) and the count is not decremented in the event that the
<code class="varname">open_count</code> is greater than 1.
</p><p>
In proper driverspeak, the way to prevent multiple opens of a driver is
this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">static int</span> <code class="varname">open_count</code> = 0;

<code class="function">driver_open</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>, <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">flags</code>, <span class="type">void **</span><code class="parameter">cookie</code>)
{
  if (<code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">open_count</code>, 1) &gt; 0) {
    <code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">open_count</code>, -1);
    return <code class="constant">EBUSY</code>;
  }

  ...
}
</pre><p>
The use of <code class="function">atomic_add()</code> guarantees
that <code class="varname">open_count</code> is indeed atomically
updated. The return value of <code class="function">atomic_add()</code> is the previous value of
<code class="varname">open_count</code>, which allows us to check whether we are the first person to
increment <code class="varname">open_count</code>. If the <code class="code">if</code> test succeeds we are not the first
person to open the driver, so we have to decrement <code class="varname">open_count</code> to put it
back to what it was before and return <code class="constant">EBUSY</code>.
</p><p>
This idiom extends to allow a maximum number of <code class="function">open()</code>'s as well.
Changing the <code class="code">if</code> test to
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#define <code class="constant">MAX_OPEN</code> 4

if (<code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">open_count</code>, 1) &gt;= <code class="constant">MAX_OPEN</code>)
</pre><p>
allows only <code class="constant">MAX_OPEN</code> number of open calls to succeed.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id531857"></a>Waiting for an Event</h3></div></div></div><p>
When a driver performs an I/O operation it usually must wait for that
operation to complete. The obvious synchronization method is to use a
semaphore. Normally a semaphore is created with a count of 1, which means
that a call to <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> will acquire the semaphore and return
immediately. A device driver, however, wants the <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> to block
until an event happens. To accomplish this, we create the semaphore with
a count of zero. Then in the device interrupt handler, we release the
semaphore to unblock the I/O request. In code that looks something like
this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="comment">/* in a driver initialization function */</span>
<code class="varname">io_done_sem</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code>(0, "device interrupt sem");

<span class="comment">/* in a driver I/O routine */</span>
... set up an I/O operation that will
    complete with an interrupt ....
<code class="varname">ret</code> = <code class="function">acquire_sem_etc</code>(<code class="varname">io_done_sem</code>, 1, <code class="constant">B_CAN_INTERRUPT</code>, 0);
if (<code class="varname">ret</code> != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
  ... the I/O request did not complete successfully ...
}

<span class="comment">/* in the interrupt handler, release the thread
   blocked waiting */</span>
<code class="function">release_sem_etc</code>(<code class="varname">io_done_sem</code>, 1, <code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code>);
</pre><p>
The key parts here are that the driver I/O routine will initiate an I/O
operation and then immediately block on the <code class="varname">io_done_sem</code> until the device
interrupts and the driver interrupt handler is called. When the interrupt
occurs and the kernel calls the driver interrupt handler, it will release
the semaphore, unblocking the thread that requested the I/O. At the end
of the sequence of events the semaphore is left again with a count of
zero and the next I/O request will block as expected.
</p><p>
The idiom in this example is the use of semaphores to block until an
interrupt occurs. This is different from typical application (sneef)
level use of semaphores, because we create the semaphore in a way that
will block on our first acquisition of the semaphore instead of
immediately acquiring it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id531977"></a>More Initialization</h3></div></div></div><p>
We can combine the idiomatic use of <code class="function">atomic_add()</code> in
the first example with the second example to show how to initialize part of
a driver once (and only once). Normally, one-time initialization is done in
routines like <code class="function">init_hardware()</code> or
<code class="function">init_driver()</code> that the kernel guarantees to be
single-threaded. Sometimes, however, that is not possible. If the driver
allows multiple <code class="function">open()</code>'s, then we need a mechanism to
insure that initialization only happens once and that any other threads
doing an open at the same time will block until initialization is complete.
</p><p>
The resulting idiom is a blend of the previous two idioms. It only
depends on the <code class="function">init_driver()</code> routine creating
a semaphore with a count of zero. In code, the whole idiom is
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">static long</span>  <code class="varname">init_count</code> = 0;
<span class="type">static sem_id</span> <code class="varname">init_sem</code> = -1;

<span class="comment">/* in init_driver() */</span>
<code class="varname">init_sem</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code>(0, "init sem");

<span class="comment">/* in driver_open() */</span>
if (<code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">init_count</code>, 1) == 0) {

  <span class="comment">/* do the initialization */</span>

  <code class="function">delete_sem</code>(<code class="varname">init_sem</code>);
} else {
  <code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">init_count</code>, -1);

  <span class="comment">/* now wait for the init sem */</span>
  <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">init_sem</code>);
}
</pre><p>
This idiom is somewhat less common, but is necessary for some drivers. An
alternative form (a dialect if you will) addresses the case in which it's
not possible to first create the <code class="varname">init_sem</code> semaphore. This case is
slightly more complex:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">static     long</span> <code class="varname">init_count</code> = 0;
<span class="type">static volatile int</span> <code class="varname">init_done</code> = 0;

<span class="comment">/* in driver_open() */</span>
if (<code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">init_count</code>, 1) == 0) {

  <span class="comment">/* do the initialization */</span>

  <code class="varname">init_done</code> = 1;

} else {
  <code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">init_count</code>, -1);

  <span class="comment">/* now wait for the init sem */</span>
  while(<code class="varname">init_done</code> == 0)
    <code class="function">snooze</code>(5000);
}
</pre><p>
This form will loop while waiting for the variable <code class="varname">init_done</code> to be set.
The <code class="function">snooze()</code> call will prevent the looping thread from consuming too much
CPU time.
</p><p>
Observant readers may ask why no protection is needed around the
manipulation of the variable <code class="varname">init_done</code>. The answer is that the thread
that performs the initialization is the only one to store to the variable
and the other threads only ever read the variable. Hence, there is no
race condition for who will update the <code class="varname">init_done</code> variable. A store to a
variable is an atomic operation and if only one thread is storing and
other threads are reading, there is no race condition.

As the dreadnaught of synchronization primitives, the spinlock is a
powerful and dangerous tool. And built around this sultan of
synchronization primitives is an idiom that carries the strength of
four-letter epithets in the English language.
</p><p>
Just like colloquial expressions involving expletives, spinlocks are not
appropriate for all situations. The most obvious example of appropriate
use of a spinlock is when an interrupt handler and regular driver code
must both perform read-modify-write operations on the registers of a
device. A spinlock is necessary in this case because in a multiprocessor
environment a thread may execute an I/O operation on one CPU, while a
different CPU handles an interrupt from the device.
</p><p>
The first question to ask is—why not use a semaphore? The answer is
simple: in the BeOS an interrupt handler cannot acquire a semaphore.
Acquiring a semaphore can cause the calling code to block. An interrupt
handler executes with interrupts disabled and, therefore, cannot block.
Not to mention the fact that if an interrupt handler blocked, other
devices that share the same interrupt would not be serviced for a very
long time.
</p><p>
Now that we're convinced that there is a reason and our device requires
the use of a semaphore to protect access to its registers, what is the
proper idiom in driverspeak?
</p><p>
In the regular (top-half) of the driver, the following code works:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">cpu_status</span> <code class="varname">ps</code>;
<span class="type">spinlock</span> <code class="varname">hwlock</code> = 0;

<code class="varname">ps</code> = <code class="function">disable_interrupts</code>();
<code class="function">acquire_spinlock</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">hwlock</code>);

  ... play with hw registers ...

<code class="function">release_spinlock</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">hwlock</code>);
<code class="function">restore_interrupts</code>(<code class="varname">ps</code>);
</pre><p>
The interrupt handler calls <code class="function">acquire_spinlock()</code> directly, and may omit the
calls to <code class="function">disable_interrupts()</code> and
<code class="function">restore_interrupts()</code> because it already
executes with interrupts disabled.
</p><p>
For code not executed in an interrupt handler, the calls to
<code class="function">disable_interrupts()</code> and <code class="function">restore_interrupts()</code>
are required for correct use of
spinlocks. If interrupts were not disabled before acquiring the spinlock,
the system could deadlock if the spinlock were held and an interrupt
occurred that needed to lock the same spinlock. Consider it an absolute
rule that whenever a driver wants to acquire a spinlock, it must first
disable interrupts (and likewise, it must restore interrupts after it
releases the spinlock).
</p><p>
The above idiomatic use of spinlocks is often wrapped in two functions
that encapsulate the pair of function calls:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">static cpu_status</span>
<code class="function">lock_hw</code>(<span class="type">spinlock *</span><code class="parameter">lock</code>)
{
  <span class="type">cpu_status</span> <code class="varname">ps</code>;

  <code class="varname">ps</code> = <code class="function">disable_interrupts</code> ();
  <code class="function">acquire_spinlock</code>(<code class="parameter">lock</code>);
  return <code class="varname">ps</code>;
}

<span class="type">static void</span>
<code class="function">unlock_hw</code>(<span class="type">spinlock *</span><code class="parameter">lock</code>, <span class="type">cpu_status</span> <code class="parameter">ps</code>)
{
  <code class="function">release_spinlock</code>(<code class="varname">lock</code>);
  <code class="function">restore_interrupts</code> (<code class="varname">ps</code>);
}
</pre><p>
The spinlock idiom of
<code class="function">disable_interrupts</code>/<code class="function">acquire_spinlock</code>
is a safe way to guard access to hardware from an interrupt handler and
regular driver code.
</p><p>
Of course, no discussion of spinlocks can go without the two main
postulates of spinlock usage:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Never disable interrupts for lengthy periods of time (i.e., greater
than 1 millisecond). Make sure you know what work is going to happen
while you have the spinlock held (i.e., the complete code-path from
start to finish).
</p></li><li><p>
Once a spinlock is acquired, any loops that spin waiting for a
hardware bit to change state should also have a safety exit in case the
bit never changes state.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Not following those two rules can cause the behavior of the BeOS to
deteriorate (the first rule) or lock up (the second rule).

This quick tour of idiomatic expressions in driverspeak should be enough
to get you talking about and understanding the code in most device
drivers. Other more complex (and subtle) idioms exist that involve
producers and consumers, but we'll leave those for another article.

4.1 is coming down to the wire and where I normally would be totally
excited to tell you about all that's great about Be and the BeOS, I'm
just typing. I'm burnt out, I have two hours left to write this article
and the truth is, I am completely uninspired.
</p><p>
I live this OS. I don't use anything else. All other operating systems
are "alternative."
</p><p>
When I'm not breaking BeOS, chasing down bugs and engineers, I make
records. I run BeOS on a Power Computing PowerTower 210 (long live PPC).
I share 650 square feet of rectangular warehouse space with Ficus
Kirkpatrick. I have an old Tascam 688 8-track cassette recorder with
<acronym class="acronym" title="DeciBel eXtended noise reduction">DBX</acronym>
noise reduction running at double speed. I master to minidisc and then
under BeOS, I use <span class="application">BamBam</span> to record, sox to swap
<acronym class="acronym" title="Audio Interchange File Format">AIFF</acronym> to WAV, and 8mHz to
create mp3's. Finished work gets uploaded to

The password thing doesn't work.
</p><p>
Before the summer of '99 comes I'll be able to trade out that old analog
8-track for BeOS software. There will be an 8-in 10-out
<acronym class="acronym" title="Analogue to Digital">A/D</acronym> converter,
phat new digital
multitrack/<acronym class="acronym" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</acronym>
application choices, and mastering
software. Alpha versions of full-featured applications from major names
in the audio and video software world will step into testing soon and I
am ready to break them. I won't say here what I know, but listen for
announcements at
<acronym class="acronym" title="National Association of Music Merchants">NAMM</acronym>.
</p><p>
Since I'm not really giving you the kind of post punk poetry you have
come to expect, I'll pass on a
<acronym class="acronym" title="Quality Assurance">QA</acronym> tool that we couldn't live without here
at Be. <span class="application">InputRecorder</span> is a program originally written by David Chayla and
hacked for stability by Steven Black. <span class="application">InputRecorder</span> simply records and
plays back keyboard and mouse input. It's a very big hammer.
<span class="application">InputRecorder</span> is best used to repeat simple tasks over and over again,
say, clicking on the Be menu until the machine dies. That actually used
to happen in pre 4.0 days. But not anymore. :) There are a couple of
quirks, but hey, it works.
</p><p>
Unzip InputRecorder.zip
[ftp://ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/input_server/InputRecorder.zip]
</p><p>
and run <code class="filename">install.sh</code> from a <span class="application">Terminal</span>
window. To use the <span class="application">InputRecorder</span>,
enter a file name in the text field. Click <span class="guibutton">Record</span>.
Click <span class="guibutton">Stop</span>, and then
click <span class="guibutton">Record</span> again. A dialog will ask you if you want to
<span class="guibutton">Cancel</span>, <span class="guibutton">Initialize</span>, or
<span class="guibutton">Add</span>. Click <span class="guibutton">Initialize</span>. Add does not work. Your mouse
should jump to center screen. You are now recording.
</p><p>
Open a <span class="application">Tracker</span> window, pull down a menu, switch to a different workspace,
switch back again, and click stop. Click <span class="guibutton">Play</span> and notice that whatever
you did will be played back in time, with pixel precision. There are two
check boxes you can enable, <span class="guibutton">Lock</span> and <span class="guibutton">Loop</span>.
<span class="guibutton">Lock</span> will lock out all mouse
and keyboard input during playback. To stop playback press <span class="keysym">Scroll Lock</span>.
Press <span class="keysym">Scroll Lock</span> again to re-enable the <span class="guibutton">Play</span> button.
<span class="guibutton">Loop</span> will, as you
probably guessed, loop the playback.
</p><p>
In <acronym class="acronym">QA</acronym> we used this tool
extensively to find memory leaks in the Kits, the
<span class="application">Tracker</span>, and the app_server during 4.0 testing. Steven Black will be
giving you a detailed explanation of the source in March, and possibly a
cleaned up version.

In reflecting upon my lengthy childhood, one recurring incident springs
to mind from my formative years: Late at night, with my parents out and
my babysitter long since neutralized, I would dial a particular phone
number over and over. After a few rings, It would be answered by a female
voice: "At the tone, general telephone time is: 9:22 and thirty seconds.
-- BEEP." Some have misconstrued this, years later, as a lonely child
reaching out for warmth and sustenance from the mother Bell. Others have
incorrectly assumed that it was my budding interest in women that drove
me to the rotary dial time and time again. In truth, though, there was
only one thing I was interested in—setting my wrist watch to be as
close to the REAL time as possible.
</p><p>
Many years later, I am a Be engineer, and despite running approximately
fifteen minutes behind the rest of the world, my obsession for time has
not lessened.
</p><p>
In contrast to my last article, which dealt with the guts of the Media
Kit in some detail, I felt it would be useful to back up a bit, and
describe the system of time measurements that are encountered when
programming media applications—a brief history of time in the Media
Kit, if you will. This will hopefully be useful as a reference when you
are dealing with the Media Kit.

The first obstacle to overcome when understanding time in the Media Kit
is that time means different things to different components of your
system.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Your <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym> measures one sort of time using its internal timer
registers. You pass timeout values to <code class="function">snooze()</code>
and <code class="function">read_port_etc()</code> in
terms of microseconds as it relates to the <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym>'s conception of time.
</p></li><li><p>
Your sound card may measure another sort of time, using its own
conception of what time is. It may report this time in terms of
"microseconds" as well, but a length of one microsecond to the sound
card may vary slightly from your <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym>'s perception of how long one
microsecond is.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, your node maintains yet a third measure of time, in terms of
your current position in a piece of media. This is also reported in
"microseconds," but this conception of time may vary from both the
sound card and the <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym>.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id532881"></a>So, How Do You Tell Time in the Media Kit?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Time in the Media Kit is governed by objects called time sources. The
purpose of a time source is to keep track of some component's perception
of time. It publishes this time as the time in "microseconds" that its
corresponding component perceives. Every time source also knows how to
convert between this component's representation of time, called
"performance time," and "real time," which is the time that is defined by
the <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym>.
</p><p>
Your media node keeps track of time by "slaving" to a time source, like
choosing one particular time source to help you keep track of time. The
Media Kit creates at least one time source for you to use. It is called
the System Time Source, and it represents your <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym>'s conception of time.
In addition, other components of your system that have their own
perceptions of time (sound card, video card, external timing device,
etc.) may have other time sources associated with them.
</p><p>
The time source your node chooses to slave to can affect performance
considerably. So, which time source do you choose? Use these simple rules
of thumb:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If you're a producer, use the time source associated with your
output, so that everything looks and sounds its best when the end user
sees it. If you are receiving buffers that are marked with times from a
time source that's different from the one you're slaved to, you'll need
to translate between that time source's performance time and the
performance time of the time source that you're slaved to.
</p></li><li><p>
If all you're doing is recording from a physical input, use the time
source associated with that input for best results.
</p></li><li><p>
If you don't have any other time source available, use the System
Time Source.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534430"></a>What Do You Do with this Time?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Here's how your node can make use of the performance time reported by a
time source:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Events that affect your node are typically specified in performance
time. When you tell a media node to start, stop, or seek, you specify
the performance time at which the event should happen. (An important
exception to this rule are time sources, which handle these events
totally differently. I won't delve into the dark world of time sources
here, however.)
</p></li><li><p>
If you are a buffer producer, you mark each buffer with the
performance time at which that buffer should be performed. If you are
also a physical input, you should instead mark each buffer with the
performance time at which that buffer was recorded.
</p></li></ul><p>
This means that you can't blindly pass buffers from physical inputs to
your system's output. Because each incoming buffer is stamped with the
time it was recorded, and there is always some delay between the input
and output, your buffers will always appear to be late at the final
output! Some node has to intermediate between the input and output of
your system to make sure the buffers are timed correctly.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If you are a buffer consumer, you generally won't be too concerned
with the timestamps on buffers you receive. If you are a physical
output, however, you use the timestamp on each buffer to figure out
when the buffer should be played.
</p></li><li><p>
Your node will often have to make system calls like <code class="function">snooze()</code> and
<code class="function">read_port_etc()</code>, which take real time measurements. In these cases,
your node will use its time source to convert performance time to real
time.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534504"></a>Media Time</h3></div></div></div><p>
Earlier in this article I mentioned a third concept of time: a position
in a piece of media. We refer to this as media time, and it is the
responsibility of each media node to determine the relationship between
media time and performance time, depending on what that node actually
does. When you send a node a Seek request, you tell it the media time to
which the node should seek. In addition, you can use media time as a
basis for scheduling events which occur at a specific point in the media
-- such as, syncing sound output to a frame in an animation.
</p><p>
Typically, media time flows at the same rate at performance time, but has
some offset (ie. media time "0" may be at some point in the future of
performance time). On the other hand, buffer producers may implement the
<code class="methodname">SetPlayRate()</code> function to increase or decrease the rate of media time
with respect to performance time. For example, if you have a sound
playback node that supports <code class="methodname">SetPlayRate()</code>, and you tell that node to play
half as fast, buffers will still be sent out at the same speed as before,
and the performance time stamped on the buffers will be unaffected.
However, the producer will only grab sound from the sound file half as
quickly, and will stretch the media out to fill each buffer.

Timing is the single most important issue that you will have to deal with
if you work in the Media Kit. Hopefully, this has covered much of the
groundwork you need to understand how time works in the Media Kit. Until
next time, just remember that there's "no such thing as tomorrow, only
one two three four --"

I struggled to find a suitable title for today's column. In the end I
chose one that describes how the company and the product feel, which is
-- just right.
</p><p>
The company I refer to is IK-Multimedia, based in Modena, Italy. Enrico
Lori founded it in 1996, to produce high-quality audio software at
affordable prices. Its current product is called Groovemaker. It sells
for $69.95. DJs use it, as do hobbyists and audio producers looking for
background sounds for videos. You can create random tracks for a virtual
DJ with Groovemaker, or mix loop libraries and create patterns for a
sequence.
</p><p>
The company, with less than twenty employees, feels like a typical
start-up, where everyone has at least two jobs. Or, as we say at Be, the
universal job description is "Do whatever you have to do." At
IK-Multimedia, every employee is a musician, which sounds like the old
Hewlett-Packard practice of designing products for the engineer on the
next lab bench. The company has its own studio and uses Groovemaker to
produce audio material to go with the product.
</p><p>
The newest offering from IK-Multimedia is called T-Racks. It will be
launched this week at NAMM in Los Angeles. It's an unusual and ambitious
undertaking, modeling an analog amplifier/compressor/equalizer starting
with the schematics, and "rebuilding" it in software using 32-bit
floating point audio. T-Racks will sell for $299.
</p><p>
The BeOS connection to T-Racks began with a meeting in Paris. This was
followed by a two-day porting session with assistance from our friend
Duncan Wilcox, who made the trip from Florence to Modena to help with the
change of platforms. Two days of work resulted in a stable beta, not the
finished product. Some code was left on the porting room floor—mostly
work required on the previous platform, but now provided by the BeOS
itself. Putting in the finishing touches and testing will take a
(hopefully small) multiple of that amount of time.
</p><p>
Of course, the credit belongs to the IK-Multimedia team. There is no
magic—only clean, well-designed code ports that easily. What feels
just right here is the combination of people, technology, company
culture, and target market. And, of course, timing—to coincide with
<acronym class="acronym" title="National Association of Music Merchants">NAMM</acronym>
later this week. It'll be fun being there Thursday.
