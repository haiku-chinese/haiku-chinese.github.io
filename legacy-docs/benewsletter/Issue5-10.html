The part of the computer industry they don't tell you about when you
decide to abandon your pursuit of a doctorate in Beowulf to stick your
tongue on the icy third rail of the information superhighway is that
you'll meet a lot of people who think they're every bit as bright as you
think you are—although many of them have, in your estimation, an
unhealthy thorough-going interest in their occupations—and that these
people will remember you as they diasporate and perhaps even recommend
you to their newer, brighter, younger, and heavily pierced communards.
This is not *bad* of itself—it's okay to be popular, or at least
remembered, or at least not despised, and, failing that, left alone --
but you are occassionally put in a position where allegiance is tempted,
and one's fear of the thrilling unknown tries to overthrow the
comfortable entropy of the familiar.
</p><p>
It was in such a mood that I received a message from a name that meant
nothing to me, but which name mentioned other names that claimed (not
inaccurately) to know mine. My interlocutress (let's call her Ms. X)
wondered whether I might be interested in taking a position of dubious
prestige with a company that had milked its audience with such determined
pulls that although a backlash was guaranteed, by then it would be too
late (i.e. an absurdly overvalued IPO followed by a reign—and reigning
still—as the Messiah of the new Church of Commercial Success without
Profit). The letter, edited to remove evidence of those involved but with
the grammar left unimproved, went something like this:
</p><p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</p><p>
Dear &lt;Your Author&gt;:
</p><p>
So I'm chatting with the ever-entertaining &lt;mutual
acquaintance&gt; today and I mention that I'm looking for a
&lt;specialist&gt; here at &lt;E-InTheRed&gt;.com who should be
completely obsessed with &lt;speciality&gt; --- to which he
responded, talk to &lt;Your Author&gt;!
</p><p>
I recruit for all product groups and marketing here at the
epicenter of ecommerce and would love to fill this
&lt;speciality&gt; position with a hip cool talented person, like
yourself (allow me to be direct).
</p><p>
Ms. X
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p><p>
(Thinks: By all means, please do be—and allow me to have felt
flattered by your direct beingness had it involved actually having met
me, or otherwise having known anything other than my name. As it is, I
refuse to be treated like a hip cool talented object!—the author)
</p><p>
It was tempting—perhaps if I forced &lt;present employers&gt; into a bidding
war I could finally give up my paper route—but ultimately I let
inertia and sloth roll me over, effortlessly, as they always do. Having
made this decision, or, more accurately, having alerted myself that I had
come to a conclusion by having not made any decision at all, I figured I
owed Ms. X an indication of my refusal and a warm smile of appreciation
for her interest. But being friendly—particularly to strangers—is
very tiring, so I decided to respond honestly:
</p><p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</p><p>
Dear Ms. X:
</p><p>
I'm flattered by your proposal.  I have no business sense
whatsoever, am unpersonable, lazy, and tend to lapse into a
pretentious self-loathing solepsism.  And that's when I'm
sober. I can understand why &lt;mutual acquaintance&gt;, who is
shorter than I am, suggested me.  I will consider the offer.
</p><p>
Sincerely,
&lt;Your Author&gt;
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p><p>
I've got mail!
</p><p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</p><p>
Dear &lt;Your Author&gt;:
Thanks for your fabulous reply. Not only did I find your
reply rife with witticisms, but I even took the time to read
some of your former BE newsletters which made me howl.
</p><p>
[ Thinks:  Add to list of words never to use: "rife". ]
</p><p>
I have a better idea than the &lt;original idea&gt; thing----
why don't you become a guest &lt;other sort of specialist&gt;? You
could &lt;practice your trade&gt; and create a devout following!
</p><p>
Addtional income for additional blathering---whaddya think?
</p><p>
Lemme know if you might be interested-----
</p><p>
Ciao,
Ms. X
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p><p>
What have I done? Or, more to the point, what haven't I been doing all my
life so far? I thought that by letting my true boor shine through I would
be met by silence, or a cordial but firm rescission of the initial offer.
Perhaps I've been taking the wrong tack all along. I coulda been somebody
instead of the bum with a paper route that I am.
</p><p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</p><p>
Ms. X:
</p><p>
I might be.  Is it okay if I write from prison?  Just a
thought.
</p><p>
Gdansk,
&lt;Your Author&gt;
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p><p>
No reply yet. Maybe she took a job elsewhere.

That's "P" as in "Platform," of course. It replaces the now dated
"Paradigm," as in Paradigm Shift. Today, I'd like to talk about how the
concept of a software platform changes in the new world of Internet
Appliances. Indeed, the whole system of thoughts orbiting around the
central idea of a platform changes.
</p><p>
In February 1981, I took my first trip to Apple's intergalactic
headquarters in Cupertino, California. Previously, I had worked at
companies such as Hewlett Packard and Data General. I'd even worked at
Exxon Office Systems, drawn by Exxon's grand and correct but culturally
maladapted vision: Information, the Oil of the 21st Century. I thought I
knew software.
</p><p>
Then, I went to one of Apple's warehouses on Java. No kidding. The other
building was on Bordeaux, in Sunnyvale. There I saw forklifts unloading
palettes of software, word processors, games, and spreadsheets. Palettes
of software—that was a paradigm shift.
</p><p>
With minicomputers, people wrote a program for their system, for its
particular use. With personal computers, one bought software, lots of it,
or pirated it. When you bought a personal computer, there was a huge
virtual stack of floppies next to it, all software that you could run.
Software gratification became a new form of gluttony. More software
attracted more buyers and larger crowds of users, actual or potential,
and that in turn attracted more software writers.
</p><p>
In what is now called the network effect, the value of a network rises
exponentially, even faster than the number of users. The same math
applies to the software platform, that is, the combination of hardware
and operating system on which an application program runs.
</p><p>
As we know, Microsoft has displayed a masterful working knowledge of the
software platform concept. With Internet appliances, though, the words
"software platform" have a different meaning. The PC carries with it the
feeling of an infinity of possibilities, a universe of application
software. In the emerging world of connectivity, infinite possibilities
move from the belly of the PC into the limitless universe of the Internet.
</p><p>
As I discussed in last week's column, there is no such thing as an
Internet Appliance, at least not in the sense of the (relatively)
well-defined PC platform. What a Net stereo and an information appliance
have in common is probably less than what two PCs might share. For
instance, the Net A/V receiver might not render Flash content and the
info appliance might not play the latest virtual reality scenes.
</p><p>
With Internet Appliances, the rules change, the interplay between the
software platform and the "bits" it must run is different from what we
have observed in more than two decades of personal computing. In
particular, the software platform no longer dictates what will and will
not run on it. Now it's the other way around—content rules. And as
long as there is no proprietary tie between the content and the player,
the game is open.
</p><p>
This of course begs a number of questions. Is anyone trying to create
such ties? And how? The rest of the exercise is left to the reader, or
for other columns.
