[As a fan of William Adams' smooth, subtle segues into each week's News
From the Front, I tried to come up with a similarly suave lead-in to this
article about <span class="trademark">OpenGL</span>®. I think I've gotten fairly close...]
</p><p>
My kid threw up the other day. Speaking of which...
</p><p>
Be's licensing of <span class="trademark">OpenGL</span>® from
SGI will bear first fruit in DR9, with the
inclusion of a software implementation of the GL API and several support
libraries, including the GLU, GLUT, and AUX packages. In this article,
I'll give a quick introduction to GL, outline GL's integration with the
Be environment, and expose some limitations of the implementation.
</p><p>
The GL API was designed by SGI as a standard software interface to
high-end geometry and rendering graphics hardware. Read that sentence
again, and shout out the words "high-end" and "hardware." Now think about
these implications:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Since it talks to hardware, the GL API is pretty low-level C.
</p></li><li><p>
All drawing is done in "immediate mode"—GL has no concept of a
"frame."
</p></li><li><p>
GL isn't a lingua franca for ALL 3D applications, or for ALL
hardware. There are many situations in which GL is less efficient than
a "lighter" solution (such as Be's 3D Kit).
</p></li></ul><p>
Let's look a these points in a bit more detail.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533366"></a>The GL "Context"</h3></div></div></div><p>
Unlike the 3D Kit or QuickDraw3D, GL has no concept of an object or world
model. Instead, GL defines "contexts." Each context holds the state for a
camera position, lighting, drawing material, viewport dimensions, and
matrix transformations. Actual drawing is done by a set of eight line-
and polygon-drawing primitives. To transform (scale, move, rotate, and so
on) a drawing, you apply your transformation to the context's
"transformation matrix," before invoking the drawing primitives.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534293"></a>Immediate Mode Drawing</h3></div></div></div><p>
All drawing operations are rendered immediately; GL doesn't slice time
into frames. You can, however, simulate frames by double buffering: You
draw into an offscreen buffer and then make a platform-dependent call to
GL's "glue" layer to display the buffer. (In the BeOS, the glue call is
part of a C++ class.) It's easy to imagine a framework built around GL
that would hide these details (GLU provides some capabilities along these
lines), but the <span class="trademark">OpenGL</span>® API itself makes no attempt to do this.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534318"></a>GL Is The Answer To High-End Problems</h3></div></div></div><p>
Because GL was designed as a universal interface to high-end graphics
hardware, it's not ideal for all 3D applications, or even for all
graphics hardware. Again, the key words here are "hardware" and
"high-end." On low-end hardware (or without special graphics hardware),
even a very efficient implementation of GL will perform poorly when
compared to a lightweight package like QuickDraw3D or the 3D Kit.
</p><p>
For example, many of GL's drawing primitives know how to take advantage
of vertices that are held in common by adjacent triangles and polygons,
but the adjacency must be "serial:" GL can't reduce an entire array (or
"mesh") of polygons to its unique vertices, it can only optimize "strips"
of polygons within the mesh. This isn't a big deal when you're talking to
hardware that boasts planet-eating geometry pipelines that can gobble
transformations faster than they can be pushed down the bus, but it's
hideously inefficient for any implementation in which the geometry is
done in software, which includes almost all of the low-end to mid-range
market.
</p><p>
There are other factors that impact the performance of a software
implementation:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Because GL provides such a large feature set, it's time- consuming to
optimize for all cases, and difficult to optimize for particular cases
without adding a lot of special-case bloat to the libraries.
</p></li><li><p>
Because GL uses an immediate-mode rendering model, some of the more
obvious multiprocessing optimizations are impossible.
</p></li></ul><p>
So OpenGL isn't for everyone. If you're thinking about writing games or
lightweight 3D controls with OpenGL, don't. These are exactly the types
of applications the 3D Kit is designed to facilitate. On the other hand,
you can do things in GL with a couple dozen lines of code that are
impossible with something as structured as the 3D Kit. And OpenGL® is
unquestionably the most widely implemented standard for real-time 3D.
There are obviously cases when this much flexibility and compatibility
are crucial, and these should be the cases where OpenGL is used.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id533782"></a>Ok, Enough Background...</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let's meet the <code class="classname">BGLView</code> and
<code class="classname">BGLScreen</code> classes. These two classes encapsulate the
interfaces for creating and managing a GL context in a window and on the
Game Kit's full screen (<code class="classname">BGLView</code> inherits from
<code class="classname">BView</code> and <code class="classname">BGLScreen</code> from
<code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>). GL options—depth buffer, alpha
buffer,
double buffering, and so on—are specified in the class constructors.
Aside from overloading several methods of their ancestors, each class
adds the same three methods to its base class, and the usage is the same:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">LockGL</code>();
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">UnlockGL</code>();
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="methodname">SwapBuffers</code>();
</pre><p>
<code class="methodname">LockGL()</code> and <code class="methodname">UnlockGL()</code>
must be wrapped around any calls into the GL C
API. <code class="methodname">LockGL()</code> ensures that the context associated with that class is the
current GL context and obtains the global GL drawing lock. <code class="methodname">UnlockGL()</code>
releases that lock. In <code class="classname">BGLScreen</code>, these methods also ensure that the Game
Kit's connection to the screen is maintained throughout the lock. The
global GL lock is required because although a software implementation may
not mind having two contexts rendering at once, a hardware implementation
will not allow this, and these calls allow the locking to be done at
whatever granularity the programmer desires.
</p><p>
<code class="methodname">SwapBuffers()</code> simply swaps the front and back buffers of a
double-buffered window, revealing the frame most recently drawn. This
should be called after each frame of animation has completed rendering.
</p><p>
The software implementation presented with DR9 is little more than a
placeholder; it's not highly optimized and doesn't support many of the
newer GL extensions. To power a real GL program, a more optimized and
hardware-accelerated implementation can be dropped in (a ripe third-party
opportunity, hint, hint). However, this implementation should be enough
to allow developers to start developing and porting GL programs. We've
tried to optimize our implementation for the common case, concentrating
on Z- buffered and non-Z-buffered goraud-shaded polygons with minimal
alpha blending or other special-effect optimization.
</p><p>
There are some limitations to the implementation's capabilities:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Most notably, single-buffered <code class="classname">BGLView</code>s are currently not supported.
Technically, this feature isn't supported because the API is
implemented in a shared library rather than in an Application Server
add-on (you need the latter to draw directly to the screen).
Furthermore, single-buffered drawing in a window isn't seen as
something that many people will want to do—if you disagree, please
let us know.
</p></li><li><p>
Another limitation is that only 32-bit rendering is supported. Output
to 8-bit screens is supported by using the Application Server's
built-in conversion and (forthcoming) dithering facilities.
</p></li></ul><p>
Of course, we'll continue to refine the Be GL implementation. Personally,
I'm heading back to school to cram more cotton into my wee noggin (I've
been an intern at Be these last seven months), but I'll be in touch.
</p><p>
I hope this has helped you decide whether OpenGL is right for your Be 3D
project. Now go forth and matrix multiply, and happy coding!

I was surprised by the overwhelming response to the BeOS at last week's
Macworld Expo in San Francisco. But the reaction was, really, business as
usual: Last January (1996), I was astonished by the crowd trying to get a
peek at the BeBoxes; at the August Macworld in Boston, I was amazed by
the number of visitors staring at the BeOS running on a Power Computing
box. This time, I expected the reaction to be less explosive. After all,
Apple was set to describe its most important OS transformation in over a
decade, and, anyway, isn't Macworld dedicated to Apple computers and
software? But I was wrong, the size of the crowd at the Be booth was even
more impressive than at Boston! The enthusiasm was still there, and the
demos were faster and better than ever!
</p><p>
This Macworld was also the last opportunity for us at Lorienne [Now
BeatWare] to show our software before releasing it. The Reggae Suite will
ship with DR9: It includes a word processor, a draw program, and a paint
program. We continue to work on a spreadsheet—it should be ready soon.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you who were at
Macworld for your support and warm reaction: Your regard is, for us, the
best award.
</p><p>
As Alex said in a previous newsletter, one of the most powerful agents
for software development is adrenaline. Indeed. But I would add dreams:
We all need to dream to dynamize our software.
</p><p>
I began to dream almost ten years ago. I was living in Paris, and Sun
Microsystems invited me (and about three hundred other developers) to a
presentation of their new system, OpenLook. Compared with what we have
sitting on our desks today, OpenLook was less than impressive, but it did
offer a tool to interactively create applications, a kind of file
browser, some graphic stuff, and the power of a UNIX workstation. Nothing
funny at all. But what was unusual was that the presentation was made by
the engineers who developed this stuff. For the first time, I had the
opportunity to discuss the software I was using with those who were
creating it! Ten of us spent half of the night with them recreating the
world.
</p><p>
Last Saturday, those of us who had the opportunity to be in San Francisco
spent the day discussing the features of the BeOS with the Be team. You
could think that for me it was simply another day of demos and
discussion, but it wasn't: The dream isn't over, and I'm as excited now
as I was last year and ten years ago.
</p><p>
Thank you all at Be, for spending this time with us. See you next time!
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="News2-2"></a>News From The Front</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">William</span> <span class="surname">Adams</span></span></div></div></div><p>
So the new year begins with a bang! We just traversed the Macworld
gauntlet, and boy was that fun. We were in quite a few places showing the
BeOS to the best of our abilities. If you visited the show at all, and
went by the Power Computing distortion field, you received quite a good
dose of the BeOS and Power's commandos.
</p><p>
Our booth was always packed. We were running a continuous stream of demos
on two large screens at the front of our booth. It was so packed that the
audience spilled over to the Orange Micro booth, which they were none too
happy about. They even erected an eight-foot-high curtain to keep people
out of their booth, and show management threatened to cut off our power.
</p><p>
There were a number of third-party applications in our booth
demonstrating quite nicely, much to the appreciation of the attending
crowds. And we were helped in no small measure by the reality of
FredLab's VirtualMac product. I've seen any number of times where a new
platform is confronted with the "There's no software" mantra. I think we
had this licked, with the exception of "Where's Photoshop?"
</p><p>
The developer's conference the Saturday after the show was well attended,
and we learned a few things about how we will do things differently in
the future. For all developers who sent in applications to be
demonstrated, we're deeply grateful. You have helped to solidify our
place as a new, exciting, and worthwhile development platform. We'll try
to continue to do right by you in the future.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534097"></a>New Faces</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are new faces in DTS. Almost from the day I joined Be a few months
ago, I've been conducting a steady stream of interviews to create a
Developer Support staff that will continue to offer excellence in service
and keep people coding happily. The fruits of this labor are three new
Technical Evangelists/Support Engineers.
</p><p>
Lauren Boyd—A Mac programmer with much experience, a big dog, and a
fish tank on her desk.
</p><p>
Geoff Woodcock—A refugee from Xylinx who wants to do support right. He
claims that noone can beat his orange, pear, apple, or grapefruit trees.
We'll see.
</p><p>
Hiroshi Lockheimer—Of screen saver and styled text fame. Hiroshi lived
in Japan all his life, speaks Japanese, and will be doing Japanese
evangelizing. Of course this means styled text must become a part of the
system along with the screen saver.
</p><p>
Our first task is to get a grip on all the different forms of
communications that our developers use to get questions into us and have
them answered. We'll encourage you to use standard forms on our Web page,
but we'll also go trawling in comp.sys.be. Our goal is to build a
knowledge base that will make technical support easier, and possibly
enjoyable. We'll announce more of these plans in the near future as they
unfold.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id534143"></a>Sputtering To A Start</h3></div></div></div><p>
We have a big year ahead of us, and a lot of work. This is the phase when
a lot of startups choke on their preliminary successes and never quite
recover. Our goals are to leave the choking to others and to excel
through attention to our developers' and end users' needs. To this
extent, if you have any suggestions for how we can make your interaction
with our organization easier, please send them to me at wadams@be.com.
</p><p>
This year we'll have more and more interesting things happening in order
to spur development of those tractor apps. I've even devised a nice
offensive little trophy to give our internal developers for their efforts
as well. So this year is going to be a lot of fun and probably lucrative
for many developers. Stay tuned, and keep coding!
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Marketing2-2"></a>Be Marketing Mutterings: Deja Vu All Over Again</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Alex</span> <span class="surname">Osadzinski</span></span></div></div></div><p>
The human mind is complex, intriguing, and often surprising. Most
intriguing of all is how memory works: How a sound, a smell, or a
combination of sensory inputs can trigger a chain of memories is not well
understood. This past week, I've been remembering events from over 25
years ago and have been analyzing the triggers.
</p><p>
By now, you've probably read and heard a lot about Macworld in San
Francisco, so I won't dwell too long on the details. My main impression
of the show was how fast the days flew by. From the moment the show
opened each day to the closing announcement, it seemed like everyone on
the Be team was running on adrenaline (or caffeine, or both) and that
time was suffering some strange relativistic compression. Our booth was
packed throughout most of the show and it was great to meet and talk with
so many Be enthusiasts. This is also the _only_ company I've ever worked
at where product demonstrators had to be almost dragged away from their
demo stations at the ends of their shifts instead of escaping from the
booth as quickly as possible. We were all getting a tremendous rush from
the reactions of people to the BeOS demos. Those of you who attended the
show and saw the big screen demo at the Power Computing booth will have
seen Mark Gonzales of Be and Mike Rosenfelt of Power Computing continuing
their hourly demos even long after both had almost completely lost their
voices; they were both working very (too) hard, but I think they were
also having the times of their lives.
</p><p>
But, exciting and enjoyable as the show was, our Developer Conference,
held on Saturday at a San Francisco hotel, was the pivotal event of the
week for me. Standing at the back of the room watching demos of BeOS
applications, I was remembering events that profoundly affected me in
1971.
</p><p>
In 1971, I was in England at the UK equivalent of high school. Our school
had an arrangement with a London-based timesharing company to have free
off-peak access: Two 110- baud dial-up lines driving 10cps teletypes
connected to a Xerox Sigma 5 computer. The environment was simple,
character-based timesharing and the ability to develop and run BASIC,
FORTRAN, and assembler programs. With 1,100 students at the school and
few on-line hours, access was limited to 6th form (equivalent to the
first year of US college) math and science students. As I was a mere 2nd
form puke, computer access was a far distant possibility. But, after a
demo at an open day, I was hooked. I took the big red London bus to Xerox
Intergalactic HQ in the far reaches of the city, begged a set of manuals,
devoured them on the long ride home, and wrote my first program (a
pitiful effort, to be sure, but a start). After pleading with my math
teacher to have the opportunity to run it, I was finally admitted to the
holy inner sanctum where the teletypes were kept, allowed to watch the
incantations required to establish a 110-baud connection, noted how
laughably easy the password was to guess (which much later led to
nefarious activities we won't go into here), and then, gasp, laid hands
on keyboard to type in my miserable little program. Amazingly, it worked
and prime numbers (yes, you guessed it) started to churn out of the
machine.
</p><p>
At that moment, I had a rare flash of insight (they happen about once a
decade) and realized that _here_ was something wonderful, powerful,
exciting and, most of all, _fun_.
</p><p>
On January 11, 1997, I had the same feeling, and it reminded me very
powerfully of that first computing experience 26 years earlier. OK, I'm
biased, but this past Saturday, with over 400 Be developers in one room,
showing off some tremendous applications, I felt strongly that we were on
the right track. Sure, we have a long way to go. We have to continue to
improve the product, to populate hardware platforms, and do everything we
can to help developers ship real-life applications. But based on what I
saw and heard on Saturday, I haven't been this excited in many, many
years.
</p><p>
In my next column, I'll go into some detail about our sales, marketing,
and support plans for 1997.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-2"></a>An Interesting Week</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Macworld is never boring, but this one was even more interesting than
usual. Apple's announcement of its acquisition of NeXT and of the return
of one of its founders, Steve Jobs, provided a great deal of exciting
news and created a context for whatever we had to say.
</p><p>
For us, this was the opportunity to state our case with facts. We were
fortunate to have a slightly larger booth (20' by 20') than last year.
Still, it was packed all day long. Demonstrations ranged from the serious
to the cheeky. The prize for cheekiness, surprisingly, goes to one of my
fellow countrymen, Marc Verstaen. Marc's company, Lorienne [Now
BeatWare], developed several products for the BeOS. Among them, a word
processor, Reggae, and AppSketcher, an application-building toolkit with
ties to CodeWarrior, Metrowerks' native development environment for the
BeOS.
</p><p>
Strangely enough, Marc thought of using AppSketcher to reproduce the
patented Steve Jobs Interface Builder demo: Building a window with a
slider and a dialog displaying the numeric value controlled by the
slider. Marc used to be a NeXT developer, he couldn't help himself. The
connoisseurs in the crowd chuckled. For a broader audience, we showed how
the BeOS could project the real-time input of two video cameras on two
faces of a rotating cube while the other four displayed QuickTime movies
—and still have power left for other activities.
</p><p>
Thus making two points. First, with fresh, modern, lightweight system
software one can realize more fully the potential of the PowerPC
architecture. Second, this is the system for creative multimedia
applications. The enthusiastic reactions in the audience lead us to
believe both points came across quite clearly.
</p><p>
Speaking of the potential contained in the PowerPC architecture, one
company did the most to promote it: Power Computing. They had the most
animated booth, with a huge video wall for demonstrations and much
martial paraphernalia to promote the idea they were fighting, and
winning. This included a convoy of Hummers circling the Moscone trade
show building, shouting slogans from roof-mounted bullhorns, and posters
reminiscent of the more subversive days of the Red Army.
</p><p>
Spectacular and effective at a time when the gloom of financial losses
and uncertain strategic pronouncements could otherwise lower the mood in
the Mac community. In keeping with our partnership with Power Computing,
we demonstrated the BeOS on their podium. FredLabs' VirtualMac got great
reviews from a crowd agitated by Mike Rosenfelt, Power Computing's
marketing wizard, who never failed to point out that if you can run Word
6, you can run anything. On second thought, I was perhaps wrong when I
gave the prize for cheek to Marc Verstaen.
</p><p>
After such a week we can't help but feel excited and humbled. Excited by
the possibilities ahead of us, a fast growing digital media market and a
system well received in it. Humbled by the work and the risks ahead of
us, delivering the next revisions of our OS, developing partnerships with
PowerPC hardware builders, facilitating the development of exciting
applications, and generally keeping ourselves focused and organized.
</p><p>
More about that in the coming weeks, starting with our developers
conference at the end of last week.

BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.

The original topic (remote, networked monitors) was usurped by action
game talk.
</p><p>
A listener wrote in to propose a port of Avara—but how should the
multiresource "mission" file format (used by the game) be emulated in
Beland?
</p><p>
"Use the BResourceFile," said the caterpillar. But there may be a
compatibility problem when trying to preserve existing mission files,
which problem could be solved by a StuffIt- like program (any takers?).

Will Be support more programming languages in the future? How will
different languages gain access to common resources (servers and
drivers, specifically)? It was pointed out (for what it's worth) that a
discussion of languages "always seems to turn to the language bindings
and then on to (the lack of) SOM, CORBA etc, doing-it-the-right-way..."

AKA: virtual mac?<br />
AKA: Emulation
</h5></div></div></div><p>
This thread, started before FredLabs' VirtualMac was shown at Macworld,
speculated on the nature of the announced Mac emulator, the legality of
the emulation (is V-Mac a "hostile port"?), the expected performance of
the emulator (with a reference to the Amiga Mac emulator that ran
faster than the original), and the possibility of creating an "app
munger" that could convert a PEF-based Mac app into a BeOS app
(according to Jon Watte, it's certainly possible—but not trivial).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id544101"></a>Subject: Universal Font Selector</h4></div></div></div><p>
Proposed: A font selector application that lets you drag-n- drop a
selected font (with size/shear/etc.) into a target app. Perhaps, as
counter-proposed, a Be-blessed Font Panel would be better—some folks
think an entire, separate application is too heavy for font selection.
Marc Verstaen wrote in to announce a Lorienne [Now BeatWare] FontPanel
(available soon).

All of the BSD file commands for ioctl() are missing. As a number of
correspondants pointed out, that's because Be is sort of POSIX, not
sort of BSD. Among other differences, Be sockets don't map to file
descriptors, so many of the BSD fd ioctl commands, indeed, can't work
(and aren't implemented). So (asks the original listener):

How do you detect if the remote end of a socket is gone?

Currently you can't create nonrectangular windows—will such a
feature ever be provided? What will you (the developer) have to do to
define a window?
</p><p>
Not a lot of controversy here yet, but we can hear the hubbub of
"preferences" in the background.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We will provide some amount of window *customization*
(settable window tab sizes, colors, orientation, more window def types,
and so forth) soon. Recognition of utter definitions will be provided
in the year 2003 according to Benoit Schillings. But he was looking at
the Belgian calendar at the time, so we're not sure what he meant.

The CS101 question of the week: Is it possible to inline virtual
functions?
</p><p>
Various opinions about the utility/sensibility/aesthetics of this
combination (that is, inline AND virtual), but the bottom line is:
Sure, a function can be declared inline virtual. However, in order to
take advantage of the inline suggestion, the compiler will probably
have to do some flow analysis to see if the class(es) of the calling
object(s) can be determined. If the class is indeterminate (that is, it
might be one of a number of subclasses that have separate vfunc
implementations), then you have to visit the vtable (and, thus, the
inline suggestion is for naught).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id544199"></a>Subject: Converting many files to type TEXT</h4></div></div></div><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id544208"></a><a id="id544210"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
How do you change the file type of a group of files?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
A lot of folks wrote in to recommend ChangeType (look in
http://www.be.com/beware/Utilities.html) and ChooseType
(http://www.be.com/beware/Add-Ons.html). For command line fans, get the
settype program from http://www.wolfram.com/~cwikla/be/.
</p><p>
Jon Watte also suggested these methods when using the BeIDE:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Drop your source files on the BeIDE icon (not in the project
view).
</p></li><li><p>
Change the "Target" preferences panel to not require TEXT type
.c, .cpp, .h files and just go by extension.
</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id544251"></a>Subject: ftpd</h4></div></div></div><p>
What's the best ftp server code to port? As always, the rfc is a good
starting point: RFC959 (ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc959.txt)
</p><p>
959 is the ftp spec; also look at 854 (telnet), 793 (TCP), and 1579
(firewall).
</p><p>
For server examples and code, there were some suggestions and
objections, among which:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
wu-ftpd from Washington University (wuarchive.wustl.edu)
</p></li><li><p>
Apache HTTP server (www.apache.org)
