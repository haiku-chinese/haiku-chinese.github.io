An article in a previous newsletter (Issue 36) contained sample code for
the Nino class, a simple audio test bed which copies audio from the
<acronym class="acronym" title="Analogue Digital Converter">ADC </acronym>
input stream to the
<acronym class="acronym" title="Digital Analogue Converter">DAC </acronym>
output stream.
</p><p>
The audio API has changed slightly in the Preview Release. This article
will illustrate the more important API changes by showing how the Nino
class should be rewritten for the Preview Release.
</p><p>
The old Nino class definition contained a buffer, two semaphores for
controlling the stream functions, and two <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> objects, one
for the <acronym class="acronym">ADC</acronym> stream and one for the DAC stream. In the Preview Release,
each <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> object has been replaced by two new objects, a
generic <code class="classname">BSubscriber</code> object and either
a <code class="classname">BADCStream</code> or <code class="classname">BDACStream</code> object.
Thus the new <code class="classname">Nino</code> class contains one <code class="classname">BADCStream</code>,
one <code class="classname">BDACStream</code>, and two
<code class="classname">BSubscribers</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <code class="classname">Nino</code>
{
  <code class="methodname">Nino</code>();
  <code class="methodname">~Nino</code>();

  <span class="type">short*</span> <code class="varname">adc_buffer</code>;

  <span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">bufferReady</code>;
  <span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>;

  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BADCStream</code>*</span> <code class="varname">adcStream</code>;
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BDACStream</code>*</span> <code class="varname">dacStream</code>;

  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BSubscriber</code>*</span> <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>;
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BSubscriber</code>*</span> <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>;
};
</pre><p>
There are two "stream functions," one for each stream, called
<code class="function">adc_reader()</code> and <code class="function">dac_writer()</code>.
The stream functions have a new "header"
argument which provides access to a timing estimate for each buffer, but
otherwise they work as before. <code class="function">adc_reader()</code> uses the <code class="varname">bufferReady</code>
semaphore to indicate that an input buffer has been received, and
<code class="function">dac_writer()</code> uses the <code class="varname">bufferUsed</code> semaphore to signal that it has finished
merging the input buffer into the output buffer.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

      <code class="varname">sample</code> = 0x7FFF;
    if (<code class="varname">sample</code> &lt; -0x7FFF)
      <code class="varname">sample</code> = -0x7FFF;
    <code class="varname">dac_buffer</code>[<code class="varname">i</code>] = (<span class="type">short</span>) <code class="varname">sample</code>;
  }

  <code class="function">release_sem</code> (<code class="varname">my_nino</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>);
  return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>;
}
</pre><p>
To simplify the example, these functions assume that both streams have
the same buffer size. Be careful not to erase whatever may already be in
the output stream. <code class="function">dac_writer()</code> is being a good citizen and mixing the
ADC stream into the output rather than overwriting it.
</p><p>
In the Preview Release, the <acronym class="acronym">ADC</acronym> stream and DAC stream always contain
16-bit stereo samples. The functions <code class="function">SetADCSampleInfo()</code> and
<code class="function">SetDACSampleInfo()</code> no longer exist. The sampling rate can still be
changed. The default sample rate is 44.1kHz and this rate should be used
when practical.
</p><p>
The Nino constructor initializes the semaphores, streams, and subscribers
and enters the subscribers into their respective streams.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">Nino</code>::<code class="methodname">Nino</code>()
{
  <code class="varname">bufferReady</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code> (0, "buffer ready");
  <code class="varname">bufferUsed</code> = <code class="function">create_sem</code> (0, "buffer used");

  <code class="varname">adcStream</code> = new <code class="classname">BADCStream</code>();
  <code class="varname">dacStream</code> = new <code class="classname">BDACStream</code>();

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code> = new <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> ("Nino ADC reader");
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code> = new <code class="classname">BAudioSubscriber</code> ("Nino DAC writer");

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Subscribe</code> (<code class="varname">adcStream</code>);
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Subscribe</code> (<code class="varname">dacStream</code>);

  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">EnterStream</code> (<code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">FALSE</code>,
                              <code class="varname">this</code>, <code class="varname">adc_reader</code>,
                              <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">EnterStream</code> (<code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>,
                              <code class="varname">this</code>, <code class="varname">dac_writer</code>,
                              <code class="constant">NULL</code>, <code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
}
</pre><p>
Note that the <code class="methodname">Subscribe()</code> function has been simplified in that there is
no longer a "clique" argument. <code class="methodname">EnterStream()</code> works as before.
</p><p>
The Nino destructor carefully waits for <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code> to exit before
deleting the semaphores:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">Nino</code>::<code class="methodname">~Nino</code>()
{
  <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ExitStream</code> (<code class="constant">TRUE</code>);
  <code class="function">delete_sem</code> (<code class="varname">bufferReady</code>);
  <code class="function">delete_sem</code> (<code class="varname">bufferUsed</code>);
  <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ExitStream</code> (<code class="constant">TRUE</code>);

  delete <code class="varname">adcSubscriber</code>;
  delete <code class="varname">dacSubscriber</code>;
  delete <code class="varname">adcStream</code>;
  delete <code class="varname">dacStream</code>;
}
</pre><p>
To test a Nino using an audio CD as input, open the sound preference
panel and select "CD" as the input source, turn down the input gain, and
turn off the loopback. Put an audio CD in your CD drive and use the
CDPlayer application to play it. You can now experiment with digital
audio processing by modifying the code in the <code class="function">dac_writer()</code> function.
</p><p>
To summarize, the most important changes which have to be made when
porting audio to the Preview Release are replacing the <code class="classname">BAudioStream</code>
object with a pair of objects (<code class="classname">BSubscriber</code> and
<code class="classname">BADCStream</code> or <code class="classname">BDACStream</code>),
adding a "header" parameter to the stream functions, and always using the
16-bit stereo sample format.

I had a conversation with a friend of mine who works for a well-known
international high-tech company. He told me a story about the way this
company works. "There isn't a single guy in my group who knows what the
---- is going on. Management wants me to save them, but I know I don't
know anything either." But, apparently he knows more than most of them.
"I wrote an application note, I didn't think anything about it,' he said.
"Two weeks later, my boss tells me that &lt;name deleted&gt; turned it in as
his own work." He continued for several minutes, ending with, "What you
know doesn't mean ----, it's all politics."
</p><p>
Maybe I'm just naive for being shocked at this. But it's a useful
reminder of why I like working at Be so much. Knowledge is definitely
more important than rank. Nobody could get away with that stuff here. I'm
feeling insecure because I'm pretty sure the VP of sales is a better
programmer than I am. I get PC configuration tips from the CEO. These
people do not get their credibility from their titles. This atmosphere is
what gives all of us the courage to test conventional wisdom by gambling
on something that appeals to our common sense. Let's step over the
gangrenous bodies of these other companies. Like they say, those who die
in train wrecks are the ones who were afraid to get on a jet.
</p><p>
The DR9 file system has changed a lot. Besides everything else, the
database-like structure you knew has been completely replaced. So, what
to do if you were using the database?
</p><p>
The new, attributed file system still has features that can be used like
a database. You can do queries. A query is just a set of Boolean
operators connecting "&lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;" strings, where &lt;name&gt; is an
attribute name. A query can only be executed on a single volume at a
time. Queries return lists of entry_refs, although this may change. Paths
may become the standard currency for referencing things in the file
system.
</p><p>
Here's an example, from <code class="filename">BTSQueryWindow.cpp</code> in the sample app:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// Create a query object.</span>
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BQuery</code>*</span> <code class="varname">query</code> = new <code class="classname">BQuery</code>();

<span class="comment">// Get the query string from the text box</span>
<span class="type">const char*</span> <code class="varname">queryString</code> = <code class="varname">mQueryField</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Text</code>();

<span class="comment">// Figure out which volume is selected.</span>

<span class="type">int32</span> index = mVolumeMenu-&gt;IndexOf(item);
const <code class="classname">BVolume</code> <code class="varname">volume</code>((<span class="type">dev_t</span>)<code class="varname">mDeviceList</code>.<code class="methodname">ItemAt</code>(<code class="varname">index</code>));

<span class="comment">// Define the query.</span>
<code class="varname">query</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetPredicate</code>(<code class="varname">queryString</code>);

<span class="comment">// Execute the query.</span>
<code class="varname">query</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Fetch</code>();
</pre><p>
The query is just a list of <span class="type">entry_ref</span>s. Here's how to show a list of
paths in a listbox, from <code class="filename">BTSResultWindow.cpp</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">entry</code>;
<code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>;

<span class="comment">// Start at the beginning.</span>
<code class="varname">mQuery</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Rewind</code>();

<span class="comment">// Step through the entries</span>
while (<code class="varname">mQuery</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetNextEntry</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">entry</code>) == <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>)
{
  <span class="comment">// Get the path, put it in the listbox.</span>
  <code class="varname">entry</code>.<code class="methodname">GetPath</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">path</code>);

  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BStringItem</code>*</span> <code class="varname">item</code> = new <code class="classname">BStringItem</code>(pathName);
  <code class="varname">mFileListView</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddItem</code>(<code class="varname">item</code>);
}
</pre><p>
Once you figure out which file you want, you've got to scan for the
attributes you're interested in. Here's some code that puts all the
attributes for an <span class="type">entry_ref</span> into a listbox, from
<code class="filename">BTSAttrListWindow.cpp</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

}
</pre><p>
Adding and removing attributes is easy. Just figure out the name, type,
and data, and create a <code class="classname">BNode</code> that references the file to which you want
to assign the attribute. A <code class="classname">BNode</code> can be
created from a path, a <code class="classname">BEntry</code>, an
<span class="type">entry_ref</span>, a <code class="classname">BNode</code>, or a
<code class="classname">BDirectory</code>. Here's writing and reading
attributes, from <code class="filename">BTSAttrView.cpp</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">// The window keeps track of the selected BEntry in the</span>
<span class="comment">// mEntry member.</span>
<code class="classname">BNode</code> <code class="varname">node</code>(<code class="varname">mEntry</code>);

<span class="type">void*</span> <code class="varname">data</code>;

<span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="varname">type</code>;

<span class="comment">// If it's not a new attribute, and the new attribute is</span>
<span class="comment">// smaller in size, you have to remove the attribute to</span>
<span class="comment">// resize it.</span>
if (!<code class="varname">mNewAttr</code>) <code class="varname">node</code>.<code class="methodname">RemoveAttr</code>(<code class="varname">mAttrName</code>);

<span class="comment">// just write the data.</span>
<code class="varname">node</code>.<code class="methodname">WriteAttr</code>(<code class="varname">mAttrName</code>, <code class="varname">type</code>, 0, <code class="varname">data</code>, <code class="varname">size</code>);
</pre><p>
So, if you want a database table, an easy approach is to make a
directory, and create one file per record. (Of course, there's no reason
they have to be in the same directory. If your app needs to spread things
around, go ahead!) The attributes on the files represent the columns of
the record. Records created in this way don't have to all have the same
columns. Also, remember when you overwrite an existing attribute that you
may need to remove it first, if you want to reduce the size of the
attribute.
</p><p>
Attributes can be indexed for fast searching. Only <span class="type">int32</span>, <span class="type">int64</span>, <span class="type">float</span>,
<span class="type">double</span>, and string types can be indexed, and indices are placed on the
volume. Also, when you create a new index, existing attributes don't get
added to it; you have to rewrite the attributes to add them to the index.
You should see a sample in
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/IndexUpdate.tar.gz that will update
indices for you.
</p><p>
A few of the current concerns with attributes. If you have a bunch of
small attributes, they may be space inefficient. There's a ~780 byte
reserved area for initial attributes (for a volume with 1024 byte
blocks), but additional attributes will require an extra file block.
Also, you can't have two attributes with the same name, which could
compound the size problem. If you need to do this, you'll probably want
to pack multiple attributes in a single buffer and store them under one
name.
</p><p>
One thing that's still a little up in the air is, what is the standard
way to store complex attributes? Anybody can pull up a string attribute,
but what about a bitmap? Is the color space the first thing in the data
buffer? What about a <code class="classname">BRect</code>? This becomes important if different apps want
to look at and edit attributes of unrelated files. There are also as yet
no standards for attribute names; how do you find an email address, is it
"email" or "e-mail"? If it becomes necessary, Be will publish guidelines.
</p><p>
One simple way to put just about anything in an attribute is to make it
archivable. Something that's archivable has a constructor that takes a
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> and implements the
<code class="code"><code class="methodname">Archive</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span> <code class="parameter">message</code>)</code>
method. Since
messages can still be flattened to a buffer, you can store just about
anything as an attribute and have an easy way to recreate it, getting the
other benefits of archiving to boot!
</p><p>
What else can be done with attributes? You've got to think differently,
you've probably never before had a feature like this, built right into
the OS to exploit. What about an OpenDoc-like document draft system,
where old revisions of the document are stored as diffs in attributes?
What about a compiler that puts function/method meta-data in attributes
so you can search it easily? How can your apps share information to make
them better? Any time your document/app has meta-data, consider putting
it in an attribute instead of in the file.
</p><p>
Lastly, when should you use attributes, when should you use resources?
Resources are not searchable. Attributes are less portable, as other
filesystems may not support attributes. This problem with attributes will
be mitigated by tools like zip that know how to include attribute
information. When in doubt, use an attribute.
</p><p>
If you want to see a working demo using attributes, download
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/AttrBrowser.tar.gz, a simple,
database-browser type app that supports the editing of a few attribute
types. To put a bitmap in an attribute, try dragging and dropping one

We've done the impossible, or at least something that is of historical
significance to the company. We have completed our first 2 day World Wide
Developer's conference. For those of you who attended, I hope you all had
a good time and learned a lot. For those of you who couldn't make it, I
hope you can make it to MacHack or Boston MacWorld.
</p><p>
We had all the drama that you would expect for a major event. Many
engineers staying up late nights, demos not working until the last
minute. Slides not coming up. But in the end, I think we made a good
accounting for ourselves and disseminated a lot of very useful
information. We had our first Master's awards program, the results of
which will be posted on the web site shortly. We also had a chance to
form new alliances, and impress a flock of new developers.
</p><p>
If you were at the Conference, you received a Early Access CD. Judging by
our email, you've gotten it onto your machine without too much
difficulty, and are now looking around for the documentation. You should
also find on the CD a number of sample applications. There are some old
familiar ones, as well as some DR9 specific new ones. You should be able
to mine these sources for useful tips on DR9isms. In the coming weeks we
will be working very hard to complete the documentation and write more
sample apps; until then, send those pressing questions to DevSupport, via
the online Developer Support form in the Registered Developers Area and
we'll try to help you out. In many cases we might refer you to one sample
app or another. If that doesn't help, then tell us so and we'll go
further.
</p><p>
During any new release, there are questions and concerns. We'll do our
best to keep you informed and programming towards the Preview Release.
</p><p>
Coming up, we have three days of conferences in Europe, Mac Hack in June,
and MacWorld in August. This makes for a very busy summer. We want you
programmers to work real hard, because the harder you work, the faster we
can show your apps, and the faster they get exposure, the better chance
they will have of making money for you so that you can continue to
program for the BeOS.
</p><p>
Our short term job is not over yet. It's only just begun. This week we
will be preaching to the Mac faithful at the Apple World Wide Developer's
Conference. I look forward to what will hopefully be a favorable
reception and a community building experience.
</p><p>
Again, for those of you who couldn't make this conference, keep up the
good work, and we'll see you in Boston. For those of you who did make it,
you now know that Yams truly does exist, and she is truly the littlest
geek. She has the tatoos to prove it.

We are just emerging from last weekend's conference, a successful one. On
the opening day, Saturday May 11th, we tallied over 650 developers coming
from the US, mostly, but also Europe and Japan. This is, as a ZDNet
report noted, twice as many as at our conference right after MacWorld, in
January of this year. And, Sunday night, there were more than two thirds
of the initial audience in the room for the closing session. On Mother's
day... What this means depends upon your perspective. We have no life, no
feelings of guilt, or the conference had something going for it. It
wasn't the food, we made sure of that, nor the location, no Palm Springs
in the lowlands of Santa Clara.
</p><p>
Seriously, how not to be ecstatic, just for a moment, before we return to
our usual oscillations between excitement and anxiety. Last week, I wrote
we were going to appear before a jury of our peers: skeptical, competent
programmers. The interest they demonstrated throughout the entire
conference was the best reward we could hope. It's one thing to believe
in our work—we do, the belief has carried us through "interesting"
times. Feeling the enthusiasm of people we respect takes our motivation
to another level.
</p><p>
The feedback we received from the January conference has been very
useful. In particular, we heeded the advice to put more technical content
in our presentations and to create parallel "tracks", simultaneous
presentations broadening the range of topics.
</p><p>
Early indications are that this was well received. We had our share of
glitches with hardware, software and sound systems, probably less than we
had a right to expect. No hugely embarrassing crashes, this will be for
an even bigger occasion.
</p><p>
As we grow, I'd like us to continue with an effort to put on a
professional show for our audience, but, at the same time, I wouldn't
want to get too far on the side of gloss. It's a bad sign when
programming manuals start looking like Cadillac brochures. The same goes
for the venue. Our use of a weekend creates a burden, but we got great
rates on everything, including airfare. I heard the hotel charged less
than one third the rate it did the following week for the bigger
company's event.
</p><p>
In many conferences, it is what takes place between sessions, the hallway
schmoozing, that makes the value of the event. We haven't yet facilitated
enough of this, it seems. It usually requires a resort, an off-site
location where people stay for a couple of days. We would have to find
creative ways to make it affordable without ending in a bad suburb of
Paris.
</p><p>
In the same vein of encouraging two-way communication, the "plenary" Q&amp;A
session at the end will demand rethinking. A larger group will make it
unwieldy and/or superficial. Those are great problems. And we need your
help in addressing them in the right combination of professional and
unconventional fashions. Venues, content, calendar, style, length,
participants, guests, media, everything is open to re-examination. But
for the central goal, creating the conditions for Be developers to
succeed, and for us to rise with the tide as a result.
</p><p>
I will not leave the topic without expressing again my heartfelt thanks
to Be developers who give meaning to our lives, and to my colleagues at
Be for the best work I have ever been a part of.
</p><p>
Now, enough ecstasy, we have to deliver.
