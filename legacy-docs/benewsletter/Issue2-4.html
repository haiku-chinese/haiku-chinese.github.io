falls into the water... Who's left?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Pierre</span> <span class="surname">Raynaud-Richard</span></span></div></div></div><p>
By now most of you have an idea of the main points of the huge DR9
feature list. But I'll not write about the new file system, the new
Tracker, or any of the other big subjects. Today, I want to add my 5
cents to a topic that's a tenured member of the list of release features:
Improving performance.
</p><p>
One of the performance-enhancing tonics that, until now, had to be
applied as an "extra" was libmoto. Available from Motorola, libmoto is an
extremely optimized library of memory, math, and string functions,
written in PowerPC assembly language. In DR9 we'll integrate libmoto into
the standard package, at which point everybody should be able to use it.
</p><p>
Libmoto is good—but is it really as fast as possible? Does it give you
precisely what you need? Is it overkill, particularly with regard to
floating-point precision? In short, can we do better?
</p><p>
At Be, these questions posed themselves as we worked on two specific
problems: Basic 3D calculations for the 3D Kit and the compatibility
between our drivers and the set of memory functions (<code class="function">memset()</code>, <code class="function">memcpy()</code>,
and so on). The result: New "fastmath" and "fastmem" libraries.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id545336"></a>Fastmath</h3></div></div></div><p>
The idea behind fastmath is that many programs don't need the high
precision and full-range definition provided by standard math libraries
such as libmoto.
</p><p>
Controlling precision in a general way is a difficult problem. At the
high end, you have people doing scientific calculations: For them, the
utmost precision is necessary. They know that even a tiny round-off error
propagated through a system can render a calculation meaningless. To
avoid excluding such scientists, math packages are all defined in double
precision and go to great lengths to maintain accuracy.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you're processing audio samples or performing 3D
computation for image rendering, you don't require scientific precision.
An error of, for example, less than 1 in 10,000 will be lost in the noise
of the pixelization process. And an error of less than 1 in 100,000 means
nothing to a 16-bit audio sample. In many cases, programmers could easily
use math functions with an error of 1/1,000,000 (within the range [ -1 ;
+1 ]). It's clear that double-precision, floating-point calculations are
unnecessary for such operations.
</p><p>
If you find yourself in this bargain basement—where, for example, a
sine or square root that's accurate to within +/- .000001 is good enough
—then you should use the fastmath library. Therein you'll find the
following math functions (the "&gt;" mark designates the "most optimized"
function(s) within a group):
</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id545371"></a>Cosine and Sine</h4></div></div></div><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>
<code class="function">b_cos_90()</code> is the fastest trig function: It achieves much of its speed
by restricting the input range to [ 0.0 ; PI/2 ]. In other words, it's
only defined for angles up to 90 degrees. Using the symmetries of the
cosine curve, you can translate the returned value for any angle, or
you can use one of the other functions, which are based on <code class="function">b_cos_90()</code>
but don't carry the input range restriction.

Actually, you *can* go further—as far as PI/2—but the relative
error becomes quite significant as you approach this limit.
</p><p>
<code class="function">b_tan()</code> doesn't restrict the sign of the input, but it doesn't fix the
growing error problem—its effective range is [ -PI/4 ; PI/4 ].

retrieve arctangents for the range
[ 0.0 ; 1.0 ] and for unbounded values, respectively.

</p></div><p>
I've listed some benchmarks and error approximations for these functions
at the end of this article.
</p><p>
One big advantage of the fastmath library is that all functions are short
C-code functions, and so can easily be inlined for even better
performance.
</p><p>
If you're interested in getting a preview version of fastmath (the header
file only; this includes the code for the inline functions), or if you
want to help us extend our support or optimize our code even more,

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id545645"></a>Fastmem</h3></div></div></div><p>
The motivating force behind fastmem is the existence of the "data cache
block" (DCB) instruction set provided by the PowerPC architecture. The
DCB instructions give you greater control over the data cache, so you can
optimize the way the cache is loaded and fetched. In particular, these
instructions let you preload data and fetch a cache line without reading
it first.
</p><p>
But to use this advanced control, you need to work with cacheable memory.
Unfortunately, not all memory can be stuffed into the data cache; for
example, you can't take the frame buffer of a graphic card and load it
into the cache. The standard memory functions (<code class="function">memcpy()</code>, <code class="function">memmove()</code>, and
<code class="function">memset()</code>) use the DCB instructions, thus they can't be used for
noncacheable memory.
</p><p>
The fastmem functions provide "cache-specific" memory operations. Within
the library you'll find that the standard functions work as usual (they
copy, move, and initialize memory), but they *only* work for cacheable
memory.
</p><p>
The "nonstandard" fastmem functions work on noncacheable memory:
</p><p>
<code class="function">memcpy_nc2c()</code> copies data from noncacheable to cacheable memory
</p><p>
<code class="function">memcpy_c2nc()</code> copies from cacheable to noncacheable
</p><p>
<code class="function">memcpy_nc2nc()</code> copies from noncacheable to noncacheable
</p><p>
<code class="function">memmove_nc()</code> copies between interleaved buffers in noncacheable memory
</p><p>
<code class="function">memset_nc()</code> initializes a buffer in noncacheable memory
</p><p>
One restriction of fastmem is that you *must* choose the proper function;
the standard <code class="function">memset()</code> call, for example, won't work on noncacheable
memory. (Actually, the functions <code class="function">memcpy_nc2nc()</code>, <code class="function">memmove_nc()</code>, and
<code class="function">memset_nc()</code> will always do the right thing, even if the targeted area is
in cacheable memory—but they will be quite a bit slower than the
analogous <code class="function">memcpy()</code>, <code class="function">memmove()</code>, or <code class="function">memset()</code> call.)
</p><p>
This might sound a bit complicated—how do you know if your memory is
cacheable? In general, only drivers need to access noncacheable memory;
"normal" applications only manipulate cacheable memory. (In the BeOS, an
exception to this is applications that use the Game Kit to access the
screen.) If you don't know if you're using noncacheable memory, then
you're not.
</p><p>
With regard to the characteristics of the memory buffers themselves:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Buffer sizes. Although the overhead for copying small buffers should
be reasonable, you may want to copy small buffers (up to 64 bytes) by
hand.
</p></li><li><p>
Alignment. The fastmem functions can handle any alignment of data,
but you should try to get your buffers aligned to 8-byte or, at the
least, 4-byte boundaries.
</p></li></ul><p>
The fastmem implementations are designed for speed, but we could probably
squeeze a few more cycles out of them if we really needed to,
particularly for nonaligned buffers.

The following tests were performed on the five main functions only. The
input set was a random suite of 10,000,000 samples within the functions'

We compared the fastmem functions to our old code as well as to the
latest version of libmoto (where possible; libmoto doesn't handle writing
into noncacheable memory).
</p><p>
The tests played by these rules:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
We set up a 4 MB cacheable area and a 512 KB noncacheable area as the
source and/or destination.
</p></li><li><p>
The tests were run on buffers ranging in size from 8 bytes up to 256
KB.
</p></li><li><p>
We tested aligned and unaligned buffers. For aligned buffers, we
stuck to 8-byte alignments, but we used all four such alignments within
32 bytes (keep in mind that a cache line is 32 bytes long).
</p></li><li><p>
So that we wouldn't be affected by a warm cache, we trashed both L1
and L2 after each test.
</p></li><li><p>
We also tested a mix of <code class="function">memmove()</code> offsets, from -(buffer_size-1) to
+(buffer_size-1). Each size was tested for a total of 10 MB, in
standard operating conditions (restart from scratch and then run only
the test program).

libmoto has been optimized especially for the 604 and 604e; fastmem
isn't dedicated to a particular CPU. We compromised to get good
performance on every processor. Perhaps later we'll have
processor-specific libraries: With 604-dedicated code, we'll be able to
get the same performance as libmoto for the <code class="function">memcpy()</code> on the PowerCenter
120 (the only case where libmoto really outperforms the new library).
</p></li><li><p>
The test for <code class="function">memmove()</code> used interlaced buffers only, while <code class="function">memcpy()</code>
used noninterlaced buffers. Because of this, <code class="function">memmove()</code> always appears
to be faster than <code class="function">memcpy()</code>.

So I was sitting around trying to think of an appropriate irrelevancy to
satisfy George's funny bone this week, and I came up with the following.
</p><p>
My wife and I are pretty cheap, I guess. We bought a book to show us how
to make things like silly putty so we wouldn't have to go out to the
store and buy silly putty. The commercial version of silly putty is a
nice, evenly textured smooshable plaything that provides countless hours
of fun for the little ones.
</p><p>
The home-brew variety consists of flour, salt, and tartar sauce of all
things. Who would think that such a strange mix of ordinary ingredients
could provide so many countless hours of fun for the tots.
</p><p>
Putting together an operating system is much like putting together silly
putty. You have a bunch of boring ingredients like device drivers,
interface kits, memory management, and schedulers, but properly combined,
they can create a product that's loads of fun.
</p><p>
The BeOS is like silly putty to me. I'm telling you, it makes me giddy
with excitement just seeing the amount of work that developers are
putting into their applications. It is a sure indication that they love
what they're doing and probably laughing while they're doing it.
</p><p>
Now that quite a few new developers have received the MacTech CD and made
it through the installation filter, we receive mail every day to the
effect of: "Now that I've tried the BeOS, going back to the Mac OS seems
silly."
</p><p>
More than a couple of developers I know are moving to California from
parts unknown so that they can be closer to the action. I like to imagine
it's because they want to be closer to the person who provides them with
interesting stories and code samples, but I think not.
</p><p>
One developer I know was invited to show their wares before 5
broadcasters, that is, people who own broadcast stations. They were
sufficiently impressed that the developer was invited to a certain ranch
of a space-faring family.
</p><p>
I also see that our ftp site is continually chock full of new entries and
updates to old ones. One of the more amusing and powerful ones I think is
myBrowser. This is a browser a la NEXTSTEP and it works quite well. It
even does some nifty things that our Browser doesn't. Additionally
there's a new Python 1.4 port for those in the know, and we've put out
our latest version of NetPositive. There's even great progress on a
native X server of all things!
</p><p>
Well, that's a mouthful for any platform, and even more so for this
particular one, considering we haven't hit our 1.0 release yet. Speaking
of which. Before getting to 1.0, we have to go through the DR9
transition. Our general plan from a Developer Services perspective is to
get ourselves boned up on the new stuff and have plenty of samples and
porting guides in place such that a developer's transition will go as
quickly and smoothly as possible.
</p><p>
For this release, we still won't be able to do much of a prerelease
before the general release goes out, so you won't be able to compile your
apps before DR9 hits the streets. But I'm wondering if it would be
beneficial to port a couple of the apps ourselves before DR9 goes out so
there's at least something to play with in the first couple of weeks,
before everyone in the world recompiles.
</p><p>
At this point I'm really just taking a poll, but if you would like to
have us recompile your app for DR9 before DR9 shows up, send me a message
and we'll see how much interest there is. Besides, our new Developer
Services staff needs some way of coming up to speed, don't they?
</p><p>
Well, after much code wrangling last week, the 3dmov and Bt848 binaries
made it out the door. They seem to have made quite a splash with the
general community and have plenty of people taunting their friends with
"Can your OS do this!" So to continue, we have two pieces to release this
week. One is a new Storage Server that Benoit put together to solve a
startup indexing problem, it can be found at:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr8_update/storage.tgz
</p><p>
The other is the source to the CDPlayer application:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/cdplayer.tgz
</p><p>
The source for the CDPlayer will show you how your application can
interact with the CD-ROM drive to play music. It will not allow you to
create a driver to support any new CD-ROM devices, that driver is
compiled into the kernel. But it will show you how to control the CD for
your own purposes.
</p><p>
Additionally, Geoff Woodcock has produced the first fruit of his Be
labors. There is a new tutorial on-line for the January application. For
those who don't know, this little application is like a HelloWorld for
graphics applications on the BeOS. Geoff was a bit concerned that all he
has done in the three weeks since he joined Be was staff the Macworld
booth, help customers, and write a tutorial. I'd say he's doing all right
so far.
</p><p>
Well, enough rambling. I can't wait for the arrival of DR9 so that I can
start pounding my drum again telling people to port because there are so
many neat new things to play with.

In what passes for my career, I've worked for tiny companies and
intergalactic companies; it's been interesting to examine the
similarities and differences between them. Something that all companies
share is a planning process, albeit with varying degrees of effort. At
one company I worked at, I had the honor of being the VP in charge of
planning one year; the process took three months and involved a full-time
team of around 20 people. Come to think of it, maybe it was a punishment
rather than an honor. The outcome of the planning process was, of course,
a plan, resplendent in its three-ring binder and sets of goals for
everyone in the company. At the lofty VP level, the combination of
corporate, business unit, functional, geographic, and personal goals
created a list of around 150 things to do that year, ranging from
gargantuan tasks on the order of "Conquer Asia and dominate the market
there" to smaller, although truly horrendous tasks like "Attend group
sensitivity training (3 days, off-site, ropes course included)." One
fervent planner published books entitled "Goals, Goals, Goals" listing
individuals' goal lists. This wasn't a joke. And of course the last three
months of the year were spent collating, justifying, and groveling, to
ensure credit for as many of the 150 or so goals as possible, in order to
receive A Very Large Check.
</p><p>
We don't do planning this way at Be.
</p><p>
Given that much of planning is numerology and internal discussions are
typically increasers of entropy, we don't waste a whole lot of time on
microanalysis. Rather, we try to listen to what our customers (currently
mostly developers) say and to react accordingly. Also, as a small company
with limited resources, we have to stay very focused: There are many more
things that we could do than we have the ability to do.
</p><p>
So, what's our plan for 1997?
</p><p>
We have three goals, and they're known to, and shared by, everyone in the
company. The first two goals are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Deliver the first "user-ready" version of the BeOS
</p></li><li><p>
Get the BeOS into the hands of as many potential users as possible
</p></li><li><p>
However, the real meat, and what the first two goals are designed to
support, is:
</p><p>
Encourage and help the development of BeOS applications
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Sure, there are numeric goals associated with these and, of course, we
have budgets to live within. But those three goals are what we're
focusing on this year.
</p><p>
There are two virtuous circles embodied in these three goals: One is that
a great BeOS product enables great applications, which in turn provide
the impetus to improve the BeOS. The other is that great applications
result in more seats for the BeOS, which creates even greater momentum
for more applications. We're very aware that virtuous circles can oh so
easily become death spirals, and we know that our job is far from done.
</p><p>
What are the implications of our goals for our customers, particularly
for our developers?
</p><p>
First, we'll be rolling out the Preview Edition of the BeOS in a few
short months. This will be the first generally available public release
of the product and will pave the way for the first "user-ready" release
later this year. Vague dates, eh? Yes, but we try hard to underpromise
and overdeliver and, when we don't know the exact answer, not to make one
up.
</p><p>
Second, we'll be making it really easy and painless for people to get
their hands on the BeOS Preview Edition. As you may know, Power Computing
will be bundling this release with most of their machines; that's one of
the very easiest ways to get the BeOS. We'll try to make it almost as
easy for buyers and existing owners of other Power Macs.
</p><p>
Third, we're continuing to beef up our developer services (aka developer
support) and evangelism teams, whose mission in life is to help
developers get their apps shipped.
</p><p>
1997 is a very important year for us and our developers. In 1996, thanks
to the kindness of the media and the enthusiasm of our many supporters,
we made a lot of people aware of our existence and what we're trying to
do. We also saw the first BeOS apps emerge, and that was a very exciting
set of events. In 1997, we're relying on that continued support to get us
to the point where users begin to do real work on the BeOS, running some
of the existing and forthcoming applications. We'll definitely do our
best to play our part, and we're all pretty excited about what can happen
this year.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-4"></a>Why Do We Pay Attention to Japan?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Why do we pay attention to Japan?
</p><p>
Coincidence or not, I was asked this question several times in the past
few days. As we make preparations for Tokyo Macworld, I'll use this
opportunity to offer our perspective on Be's involvement with Japan.
</p><p>
There are many aspects to it. Let's start with customers. Go to the Laox
Computer store in the Akihabara (all things electronic) district of
Tokyo. There's a magazine section on the ground floor. At 5 pm,
high-school and college students are standing four deep at the racks,
reading the US and Japanese computer magazines. There's a large, active
techno- nerd, geek, propeller-head population in Japan, just as in the US
and Europe. And contrary to a persistent legend, there's an appetite for
US hardware and software products in Japan. The Macintosh sells well, the
Amiga still has a following, PC makers such as Compaq enjoy very good
business there and, of course, Bill Gates receives the immense, somewhat
fearful respect accorded to quasi-divine creatures.
</p><p>
The BeBox and the BeOS have been granted an initial warm reception, many
magazine articles have been published, web sites are dedicated to our
products, and Fumihiko Shibata, noted magazine editor, just published the
first BeBox Guide Book in Japanese (ISBN 4- 89369-490-1).
</p><p>
We're very happy, and we're concerned. Many Western companies have
floundered because they took the Japanese customer for granted, failing
to pay the local custom, the local ways of doing business, the respect
that generates a trusting relationship necessary for any business to grow
beyond the novelty stage. Beyond the early adopters who read enough
English and accept the US version of a product, a great deal of detailed
work is required for us to offer a product fit for broader consumption in
Japan. And we need to find the right partnerships that would guarantee
the Japanese customer the continuity, the level of service, the overall
comfort they are entitled to.
</p><p>
With 400,000 to 500,000 PowerPC machines sold yearly in Japan, the market
more than justifies the extra effort. But there's more than market size.
It seems that Japanese customers are, on the average, more interested in
multimedia applications than are customers in other Western markets,
where personal computers are predominantly office automation machines.
Our product, focused on creative digital media applications, fits nicely
with the multimedia bias in the Japanese market. And where do the new DV
cameras or the DVD units come from?
</p><p>
This leads me to developers. There has been a tendency to stereotype
Japan as less individualistic than, say, Silicon Valley and therefore
less creative. Large bureaucratic keiretsus leave no room for
entrepreneurs. Add a different writing system and the sum is: No Japanese
PC software developer success stories. As for the lack of creativity,
this is absurd. Look at the arts. Same for the lack of entrepreneurs.
Small businesses flourish everywhere, their styles are different.
Actually, less and less so. To the more worldly Japanese software
entrepreneurs we offer a "born on the Web" distribution model yielding
instant access to the rest of the world. And when we have a properly
localized and supported product, our platform will play well to the
natural trends of the Japanese market. Speaking of success stories, we'd
love to be part of one relating how a programmer in Kobe sells his
digital video editor to BeOS users worldwide.
</p><p>
We can't help it, we like Japan. We would immensely enjoy doing a decent
job in this very different, very attractive market. This might not be the
most rational of motives, but liking one's customers can't hurt.

AKA: The FBC<br />
AKA: FBC problem<br />
AKA: Be's FBC hack won't work<br />
[and others...]
</h5></div></div></div><p>
Here we pat Be's fragile base class solution (reserved functions and
library versioning) on the head and cuff it about the ears. The pro and
con philosophies go something like this (con first):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Some folks think that since a real solution will be needed
someday anyway, it's better to suffer the pain of the adoption now
(and everyone admits that the pain will be substantial) rather than
after the first commercial release of the OS.
</p></li><li><p>
Proponents of Be's "hack" solution point out that the problem may
be more theoretical than practical: A theoretically pure and elegant
FBC solution provides more backward compatibility than anyone needs;
better to have a lightweight, if homely, solution (intramajor release
compatibility) since advances in feature set alone will necessitate a
rewrite every couple of years.
</p></li></ul><p>
There's also a middle position: It would be nice to have an elegant FBC
solution, but there's no such thing for C++. You can have the language
or you can have robust base classes, you can't have both. This argument
spawned COM/SOM/Objective-C comparisons.
</p><p>
Some technical questions and observations:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Would the reserved functions look like this: virtual void
*SpareFunc(void *arg1, void *arg2 ..., void *argN); ?
</p><p>
Others wrote in to offer that only the function name entry in the
vtable is important, so the arguments would be eliminated, reducing
the declaration to: virtual void *SpareFunc();
</p></li><li><p>
Dave Haynie pointed out that library versioning has inherent
problems: In addition to requiring that you keep many Release N.x
libraries around, you could end up with different versions of the OS
shouldering each other out of RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
Jens Alfke upped the ante by opining that versioning only works
for "monolithic" apps; if an app loads an add-on, the app and the
add-on need to have been linked against the same library. Jon Watte
adjusted this notion: A version 1.5 app (for example) should be able
to load any 1.x add-on (in other words, the minor version numbers
needn't match).
</p></li><li><p>
It was mentioned (and forehead-slappingly agreed) that in order
for the reserved (virtual) function scheme to work, every subclass
must implement all the reserved functions of its ancestors (whether
they actually do anything or not).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id546633"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id546639"></a>Subject: GUI (in)consistency</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">
AKA: Applications without windows<br />
AKA: Let's move out the main menu f<br />
AKA: Application start-up and take-down time
</h5></div></div></div><p>
Various opinions about matters GUI: Menus, menu bars, the dock,
(potentially) windowless apps, and so on. Some specific topics:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Should ALL of an app's menu items appear in the same place --
that is, either in a menu bar *or* in the main menu (or both)?
</p></li><li><p>
Where should an app's main menu be displayed? According to many,
the top of the dock isn't intuitive.
</p></li><li><p>
Should closing an app's last window kill the app?
</p></li><li><p>
Window miniaturization should show an icon, not a title bar.
</p></li><li><p>
Let the user decide where the dock will be displayed (left or
right side of the screen).
</p></li><li><p>
Please, Be, give us window-management conventions (cycling,
tiling, backgrounding, foregrounding, and so on).
</p></li><li><p>
Should a new window always grab focus? Even if you're still
typing in the old window?
</p></li></ul><p>
Many opinions and a LOT of traffic. The need for UI guidelines is
clear, and the hope that the guidelines will be adhered to (once
they're published) was voiced explicitly (by Mike Coleman, in
particular) and could also be felt in the many arguments that
hypothesized the naive user's experience.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: General user interface guidelines for Be applications were
published in an article in Issue 51 of The Be Newsletter. That article
is the introduction to the Be User Interface Guidelines chapter of the
DR9 edition of The Be Book, which is being written now.

AKA: Tracker suggestion<br />
AKA: A Better name for Tracker?<br />
AKA: Be Newsletter Issue # 57, January 22, 1997
</h5></div></div></div><p>
A number of folks wrote in to comment on Steve Horowitz' column (in
Issue 57) about Tracker, the DR9-generation browser. Among the
suggestions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Allow MIME mapping based on arbitrary attributes (not just
filename extension), particularly for nonnative systems. For example,
HFS could use a type/creator -&gt; MIME mapper.
</p></li><li><p>
Integrate HTML support.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow multiple handlers per file; for example, you may want an
HTML file's primary handler to be NetPositive, and its secondary
handler (through Command-click, perhaps) to be an editor.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a means for add-ons to announce the types that they can
handle.
</p></li><li><p>
"Live icons" should be semitransparent.
</p></li><li><p>
A lot of name suggestions, too many to list here.
</p></li></ul><p>
THE BE LINE: There was some confusion over the phrase "live icon
dragging." It means (as several contributors correctly surmised) that
when you drag an icon, you'll see the icon picture being dragged, not
just the outline of the icon's frame. It doesn't refer to animation
running in an icon. We apologize for the muddle.
</p><p>
Regarding add-ons being able to announce the types they can handle:
This will be done, although not necessarily in DR9.
</p><p>
We appreciate the name suggestions, but for now we'll stick with
"Tractor"... uh, excuse me, "Tracker."

This thread, which took off from the FBC discussion, branched into
system folder talk: Where should it be, what should be in it, should
there be more than one (one for Be, another for third parties, a third
for the user, and so on).

A new listener wondered why BView blanks to white before redrawing.
Many folks wrote in with suggestions: Use a transparent background
color, draw to an off-screen buffer first. The best result can be
gotten from this bit of advice: Don't Invalidate() the view; instead,
call Draw() directly.
</p><p>
A smarter double-buffering scheme was requested.

Listeners yearn for the ability to script URL requests. For example, it
would be nice to be able to send NetPositive a message telling it to

An idea (paraphrased from Daniel Lakeland):
</p><p>
Why not have a key stroke combination that kills the Application Server
(and client programs). You would then drop into a terminal from which
you could "hack and slash away at the currently running programs."
</p><p>
The point, here, is to more gracefully bring down a crashing machine.
The initial idea spurred other suggestions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Ctrl-Alt-Del should shut down, not just reboot.
</p></li><li><p>
Tracker and the Application Server should relaunch after a crash.

A feature request for Be: How about copying the contributed code from
the ftp site onto the DR9 CD? It would have to be recompiled, and some
of it probably wouldn't work in DR9, but is that so bad? How about a
commercially released version of the site—would anyone pay for a CD
of ftp contributions?
</p><p>
It was pointed out that such a CD is already available, from Adamation
(see www.adamation.com for information).
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Sorry, but Be probably won't burn the ftp site onto the
CD. As William Adams put it: "Yes, it would be good to [distribute] the
sources, but I don't think it would make us look very good to release a
bunch of stuff that doesn't work with our brand spanking new release."
