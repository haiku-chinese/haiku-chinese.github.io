Developer support recently released the source for the audio CD player
that we ship with the BeOS. Unfortunately, if all you're interested in is
how to make driver calls to perform the audio functions, you'll have to
pore over a lot of UI fluff code to get to the interesting nuggets. The
point of this article is to describe the driver calls available for
playing, scanning, and saving CD audio, and to point you to some simple
sample code that exercises all the available functions.
</p><p>
With DR9, the BeOS supports both
<acronym class="acronym" title="Small Computer Systems Interface">SCSI</acronym> and
<acronym class="acronym" title="AT Attachment Packet Interface">ATAPI</acronym>
(<acronym class="acronym" title="Integrated Drive Electronics">IDE</acronym>)
CD drives; both
types of devices are serviced by the same set of driver ioctl calls for
audio access.
</p><p>
A number of the calls described below use a positioning type called MSF,
which stands for minute, second, frame. A minute is 60 seconds (duh), a
second is 75 frames, and a frame is one 2352-byte sector, which contains
588 samples of 16-bit stereo audio. I recommend you get either the <acronym class="acronym">ANSI</acronym>
<acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> standard or the <acronym class="acronym">ATAPI</acronym> standard
for more detailed descriptions of a
number of data structures that are used.
</p><p>
Before any audio functions can be performed, a device needs to be
located. To do this, scan the DR9 <code class="filename">/dev/mountable</code> directory and make
<code class="constant">B_GET_GEOMETRY</code> ioctl calls to all the drivers. Test the "device_type"
field against the <code class="constant">B_CD</code> constant. Drivers with the type <code class="constant">B_CD</code> will
support the calls described below.
</p><p>
Now that you have a device and have popped a disc in, you'll probably
want to list the contents of the disc—the <code class="constant">SCSI_GET_TOC</code> call will do
the trick:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_GET_TOC</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">toc</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">toc</code> is a pointer to a <span class="type">scsi_toc</span> data structure. This structure is
described in the <acronym class="acronym">ANSI</acronym> <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> spec
and the <acronym class="acronym">ATAPI</acronym> spec. The structure
contains a four-byte header followed by an eight-byte TOC descriptor for
each track. The header contains the starting and ending track number and
the length of the TOC data. Each TOC descriptor contains the track
number, the starting location for the track (in MSF format), and flags
that you use to determine whether the track contains audio or data
information.
</p><p>
Now that you've located an audio track you'll want to play it; unless, of
course, you've popped in a Grateful Dead CD. The simplest way to play a
track is to tell the driver to play from a starting track number to an
ending track number:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_PLAY_TRACK</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">track</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">track</code> is a data structure used to specify the starting and ending track,
along with a starting and ending index (in most cases 1).
</p><p>
To get a bit more control about where to start and end, use the following
call:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_PLAY_POSITION</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">position</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">position</code> is a data structure that specifies the starting MSF and the
ending MSF.
</p><p>
To pause, resume, and stop audio playback, you use these calls:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_PAUSE_AUDIO</code>);

<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_RESUME_AUDIO</code>);

<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_STOP_AUDIO</code>);
</pre><p>
Ejecting a disc is simple and satisfying:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_EJECT</code>);
</pre><p>
Too soft? Crank it up:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_GET_VOLUME</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">volume</code>);

<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_SET_VOLUME</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">volume</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">volume</code> is a pointer to a <span class="type">scsi_volume</span> data structure. The data structure
contains a channel and volume field for each port (four ports, maximum).
For each port the volume range is from 0 (muted) to 255. To set the
volume or channel for a particular port, you must also set the change
flag bit for each field (this allows changing individual fields without
affecting the other fields).
</p><p>
To get the current play status and position, use the following call:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_GET_POSTITION</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">position</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">position</code> is a pointer to a <span class="type">scsi_position</span> data structure. Once again this
structure is described in detail in the <acronym class="acronym">ANSI</acronym> and
<acronym class="acronym">ATAPI</acronym> specs; briefly, it
contains a flag byte that indicates whether play is in progress, paused,
completed, or "errored" and what are the current track, index, absolute
MSF, and track-relative MSF position.
</p><p>
To scan (fast forward, fast reverse) there is the following call:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_SCAN</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">scan</code>);
</pre><p>
The scan data structure specifies the direction (+ = forward, - =
reverse, and 0 = stop scanning) and the speed (0 = normal scanning, 1 =
high-speed scanning) at which to scan. (Not all devices support
high-speed scanning.) To stop scanning, you must use the same call again
with a direction of 0.
</p><p>
The last command described is the one for reading audio data to memory:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">device</code>, <code class="constant">SCSI_READ_CD</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">read</code>);
</pre><p>
The read structure specifies the starting position (in MSF format),
length (also in MSF format), buffer_length, buffer address, and a flag
indicating whether to play the audio at the same time it's being read
(not all devices support this). The format of the data read is 16-bit
stereo, left channel followed by right channel. One last point to keep in
mind: You'll need to byte-swap the audio data you read from the media
before playing it back on the BeOS.

With the recent rerelease of the Star Wars trilogy here in the United
States, I find myself once again contemplating life and its reflection in
visual media. I am now convinced that Jabba the Hutt was a programmer in
his earlier career and chose a path of management.
</p><p>
I see the evidence in myself. When I started programming, oh so many
years ago, I was thin, in good shape, and ready to take over the world.
As the years roll on, as does my office chair, my bottom line keeps
expanding. Unable to move, I delegate. Then along comes the BeOS.
Something new and exciting to challenge and thrill. Suddenly I'm jumping
up out of my seat and yelling YES!! whenever I can do something that I
couldn't do before.
</p><p>
One of my pet programming things is to do graphics. That is, graphics
libraries on the sly. It's never been my profession, but it's always been
my obsession. When the <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ first hit the streets, I created a thing
called the YAGS library. Of course this stands for Yasmin Adams' Graphics
System, or for those who are more UNIXY, Yet Another Graphics System. The
purpose of YAGS is to support much of the higher level graphics found in
the BView class, but to do it on an arbitrary frame buffer. That means
the screen, through the Game Kit, or a BBitmap.
</p><p>
To that end, YAGS has primitives to draw lines, ellipses, rectangles,
triangles, and bezier curves. I twiddled with 3D a bit, but not enough. I
ported it to DR8 and let it languish. So here it is:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/lib/yags.tgz
</p><p>
There's a simple demo program you can run to see how fast your little
machine can really go. You can choose to either use the software-only
routines or the Game Kit routines that will use hardware acceleration (if
available).
</p><p>
As for some cleanup, last week we put out the vidview package, which
allows you to write apps to the Hauppauge video digitizer board. Thanks
to Kevin Hendrickson, a long- standing bug has been squashed.
</p><p>
In the vidview.cpp file you would find:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">VideoView</code>::<code class="methodname">WaitForStop</code>()
..
    <code class="function">kill</code>(<code class="varname">drawer_id</code>, <code class="constant">SIGINT</code>);
</pre><p>
Change this to:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">VideoView</code>::<code class="methodname">WaitForStop</code>()
..
    <code class="function">kill_thread</code>(<code class="varname">drawer_id</code>);
</pre><p>
You'll find that the application closes down more reliably more often.
I've made this change to the sample code and added sliders for hue and
saturation. You can download the revised package from:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/vidview.tgz
</p><p>
The DR9 man approacheth, and as that inevitable date draws near, we'll
all become antsy with anticipation. Font system changes, file system
changes, archiving, the Tracker, Unicode. That's a lot of change. What
we'll do is to provide all the application samples that we included with
DR8, but in a more timely manner. That way everyone will be able to
compare new stuff to old stuff and see what's changed. We'll try to get
these samples out much sooner than before to help you upgrade.
</p><p>
I may feel like a Hutt at times, but the BeOS is keeping me on my toes
and at least exercising my mind—if not my whole body.

The last few days have brought very good news for the net. Older media
giants loose oodles of money on their sites, Netcom buys full-page ads to
announce a price increase, and Dell chalks up more than a million dollars
a day in sales revenue from their Web site.
</p><p>
I'll leave the first item alone: We should be grateful to our well-heeled
elders for exploring the new math on our behalf—and on their nickel.
And it's nice to see Dell showing both muscle and flexibility in using
the new medium, once again cashing in on the benefits of their reputation
for good customer service. "Too bad they don't make Mac clones," sighed
an unnamed Be wag.
</p><p>
Today, Netcom places large ads congratulating their employees for a great
job and proudly announcing a new product. On closer inspection, the new
product is a new price structure for all-you-can-eat net connections,
with new "Fair Use" guidelines. Netcom, one of the early net access
companies in the Valley, is taking the lead in trying to institute
classes of service among their customers. As many politically incorrect
observers predicted (led by Jack Rickard, the editor-in-chief of
Boardwatch magazine), the all-you-can-eat buffet doesn't lead anywhere.
It creates perverse reactions among users and ends up frustrating
everyone, starting with the people owning shares in the restaurants.
</p><p>
At first the flat rate attracts customers. As the customers grow in
numbers, some diseconomies of scale manifest themselves. There are phases
in the growth of the system where adding more customers costs more,
because some subsystems run out of capacity and grafting on bigger ones
sends ripples through the whole thing, including your P/L. On the surface
of things, ten subscribers per modem looks like a good number. But beyond
a certain number of modems, you need big, expensive iron to aggregate the
traffic. Beyond a certain size, the computers themselves have to be
jettisoned, and further complications—and costs—occur when they
have to be clustered.
</p><p>
Some have equated the problem of flat-rate ISPs to the all- you-can eat
restaurant whose owner watches two buses of sumo wrestlers pull in. The
metaphor needs a little tweaking. What in fact happens is the number of
subscribers per port increases. As a result, quality of service—access
when needed, in this case—degrades. Seeing this, customers stay
connected once they gain access, whether they need the service or not.
Other customers stay at the door. The ISP sees this and disconnects
inactive users. The anxious customers get little utilities that fake
activity. And so on. Why disconnect if it doesn't cost more and you can't
reconnect? That's the vicious circle Netcom and other ISPs are trying to
defeat when pledging allegiance to the Fair Use Initiative and trying to
move to a tiered pricing system. The Fair Use Initiative addresses many
more issues than just "hogging" a connection, but it essentially tries to
promote the concept of moderation in a system that discourages it. We'll
watch as they, and others, negotiate the transition to a more rational
pricing structure. Especially when competitors might try to undercut
them, only to raise prices later once they've caused enough concentration.
</p><p>
The rationale invoked for flat pricing is the phone companies' alleged
flat costs for long distance. The legend is that AT&amp;T once considered
flat pricing. All you can talk for a flat monthly fee. But people would
have kept phone lines open for hours. Ask any parent owning or operating
a teenager. Metered service is good. It doesn't have to be as greedy as
the cellular providers rounding up to the next minute. Just raise the
pricing slope a little, and the self- defeating hogging of connections
will disappear without making the Internet much more expensive.

More feature requests for DR9. This week: Stability. Is it possible to
be absolutely crash-proof? Most folks think not. However, some
listeners wrote in to request that the UI (at least) be perfectly safe.
Giving the user an "uncrashable" OS is a worthy ideal, but, as Osma
Ahvenlampi pointed out...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If you wanted to make a really secure OS, it would also be a really
slow OS... If the OS is stable enough to stay running without a need to
reboot it for 30 days on average... it's easily stable enough for most
users to never see a crash.</span>”
</p><p>
Just as important as stability is integrity: If an app crashes (or
otherwise misbehaves), it shouldn't damage critical files and resources
such that the OS crashes or, worse, needs to be reinstalled.

A request from Chris Dunphy:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">One UI feature I haven't seen called for yet is mouse blanking. When I
start typing, I want the mouse pointer to vanish and get out of my way,
only appearing again when I actually touch the mouse.</span>”
</p><p>
A few listeners wrote in to point out that some applications (Edit, in
particular) exhibit exactly this behavior. The request was then
modified for scope: Can mouse blanking be a system-wide setting? Many
votes in favor, but perhaps, thinks Brian Stern, global enforcement is
too much:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">It isn't always appropriate to obscure the cursor for every keydown...
All that's missing is a line in the human interface guidelines saying
that this [calling <code class="methodname">ObscureCursor()</code> within appropriate apps] is the
right thing to do.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id554485"></a>Subject: New File Selector in DR9?</h4></div></div></div><p>
Will the "file selector" (or "Open panel") be smarter in DR9? In
particular, will it support [from Steve Klingsporn and others]...
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A "favorite folders" pop-up menu
</p></li><li><p>
View mode options (icon, small icon, list mode, and so on)
</p></li><li><p>
Special display of the selected file (SK: "You could have an icon
showing the selected file in the left corner, or a list view of
currently selected files...")
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to define and install your own panels
</p></li><li><p>
Drag-and-drop into the open panel
</p></li><li><p>
Easy Rename (as opposed to clunky Save As)
</p></li></ul><p>
Howard Shere (and others) proposed a "panel-less" system of
saving/opening files, based on the idea that "standard" panels (and
this applies to almost all modern GUI OS's) give you a redundant view
of the world. Mr. Shere...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Save: An icon on the title bar of the window... can be dragged to the
Tracker to save the file. You can save anywhere in this fashion. Spring
loaded folder type action can allow you to drag into any folder in the
system without releasing the mouse button. Open could open a small
'drop box' window which documents can be dropped on to open them. Since
this would not be modal, this could be opened all the time. It would
have to float about all of the windows for this to work.</span>”
</p><p>
An objection to this system (paraphrasing Mike Manzano): The Open/Save
panel is compact. When you use the Tracker to look for a file or
folder, you get a window for each level of hierarchy. The Open/Save
panel is much neater in this respect. Also, relying on the Tracker for
these operations can lead to the "obscured target window" effect.
</p><p>
Relatedly, Jon Watte would like notification when a file is dragged to
the trash:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">[W]hen a file is dragged to the trash, the application having it open
should close the file in question. Right now, there is no good way of
finding out when and if a file is in the trash.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id554585"></a>Subject: Subject: Be Newsletter Issue #65, March 19, 1997</h4></div></div></div><p>
Reaction to Dominic Giampaolo's Newsletter article on good programming
practice. It was pointed out that Be's example source apps don't always
adhere to the principles Dominic advised, particularly with regard to
checking errors.
</p><p>
A few misconceptions were cleared up: It was thought that recycling
resource IDs could create race conditions. Dominic pointed out that
resource IDs (thread_id, sem_id, and so on) are NOT quickly recycled.
The IDs are incremented to the maximum value before the incrementor
turns over. After the turnover, moreover, only "free" slots are used.
</p><p>
There was also some thought that resources weren't reclaimed properly.
Not so: The structures and address space-specific data that support an
app's threads, semaphores, ports, images, teams, and areas ARE
reclaimed when the app dies. The actual memory behind a shared area or
