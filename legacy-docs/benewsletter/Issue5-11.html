This week and in my next article, I'm going to show you, function by
function, how to write a BeOS driver for a USB Video camera—or at
least how I wrote one. Before you get too excited, let me say that the
cameras this driver supports are getting a bit long in the tooth, and may
be hard to find in retail stores these days. Also, this driver requires
support for isochronous transactions in the USB stack, so it will only
work with the upcoming BeOS 5 release.
</p><p>
Vision VLSI Ltd. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vvl.co.uk/">http://www.vvl.co.uk</a> makes their Colour Processor
Interface ASIC (CPiA) documentation available for those who want to write
drivers for it. This documentation has been used to create a CpiA driver
for Linux; links to the docs we'll use to write the BeOS driver are at
<a class="ulink" href="http://webcam.sourceforge.net/#info">http://webcam.sourceforge.net/#info</a>. The most important document is the
Software Developer's Guide for CPiA Cameras
<a class="ulink" href="http://webcam.sourceforge.net/docs/developer.pdf">http://webcam.sourceforge.net/docs/developer.pdf</a>. You can also find a
list of supported cameras at <a class="ulink" href="http://webcam.sourceforge.net/#cams">http://webcam.sourceforge.net/#cams</a>. I'm
using the Ezonics EZCam USB (not the Pro or Plus version), which I picked
up at a local store about a month ago. I'm not sure about the
availability of the other cameras. Vision VLSI Ltd. is still around,
still making ASICs that appear to use some version of the CPiA command
set, so there may be some new cameras this driver could support with
little or no modification. We'll see.
</p><p>
In this first article, I'll discuss implementing basic driver
functionality, and how to send CPiA commands to the camera so its various
parameters and modes can be set. I'll cover some material that's been
covered before, because hearing the same thing two different ways can be
helpful. To quote our esteemed QA Manager
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.catastropherecords.com/StThomas.mp3">http://www.catastropherecords.com/StThomas.mp3</a>, "This is the long
boring part." In my next article, I'll tackle getting and processing
video data from the camera. You can find the code for this week's
incarnation of the driver at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/drivers/CPiA.zip&gt;. Grab it and follow along.
</p><p>
The driver comprises three source files: <code class="filename">CPiA.c</code> contains all function
implementations; <code class="filename">CPiA.h</code>
contains definitions the public clients of the
driver will require, such as opcode constants and a parameter struct for
<code class="function">ioctl()</code>; and <code class="filename">CPiA_priv.h</code>
contains typedefs and constants used privately
by <code class="filename">CPiA.c</code>. Since there's only one source file, it's not strictly
necessary for <code class="filename">CPiA_priv.h</code>
to be a separate file, but it keeps things
organized.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id450293"></a>Exported Symbols</h3></div></div></div><p>
All BeOS drivers—USB or not—must export certain functions and
values so the kernel can load and interact with them. I'll refer to these
as the exported symbols. They've been discussed several times before, but
let's review them in the context of USB drivers and the CPiA driver in
particular.
</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id450308"></a>api_version</h4></div></div></div><p>
The first exported symbol is the easiest to implement: it's the <span class="type">int32</span>
value <code class="varname">api_version</code>, and a driver simply needs to include the line
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">api_version</code> = <code class="constant">B_CUR_DRIVER_API_VERSION</code>;
</pre><p>
to fulfill its obligation. <code class="constant">B_CUR_DRIVER_API_VERSION</code> is defined in
<code class="filename">Drivers.h</code>, and as you might guess, it lets the kernel know which
version of the driver API a driver uses.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id450361"></a>init_hardware()</h4></div></div></div><p>
<code class="function">init_hardware()</code> is called only once in a particular runtime session
(i.e., from boot to shutdown). For devices that remain connected to the
computer for an entire runtime session—such as ISA and PCI cards—it
may make sense to use <code class="function">init_hardware()</code> to see if the device is indeed
connected and put it into a known initial state. However, it's not too
useful in drivers for devices that can be hot-plugged while BeOS is
running— such as USB devices—because the device may not be plugged
until after the first time the kernel loads its driver. Therefore, if
you're one of those short attention span types who's been looking for
<code class="function">init_hardware()</code> in <code class="filename">CPiA.c</code>,
stop—it's not there. Implementing it is
optional, and I chose not to for this driver.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id450398"></a>init_driver()</h4></div></div></div><p>
<code class="function">init_driver()</code>, on the other hand, is called every time a driver is loaded
by the kernel, and must be implemented by all drivers. <code class="function">init_driver()</code>
should allocate resources that will be needed as long as the driver
remains loaded. USB drivers should take this opportunity to introduce
themselves to the USB (Bus) Manager like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="comment">/* declare these globally */</span>
static <span class="type">char*</span> <code class="varname">usb_name</code> = <code class="constant">B_USB_MODULE_NAME</code>;
static <span class="type">usb_module_info *</span><code class="varname">usb</code>;

<span class="type">usb_support_descriptor</span> <code class="varname">supported_devices</code>[] =
{
    0, 0, 0, <code class="constant">VENDOR_ID</code>, <code class="constant">PRODUCT_ID</code> }
};

...

<span class="comment">/* do this in init_driver() */</span>
if (<code class="function">get_module</code>(<code class="varname">usb_name</code>,(<span class="type">module_info**</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">usb</code>) != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
    <code class="function">dprintf</code>(ID "cannot get module \"%s\"\n", <code class="varname">usb_name</code>);
    return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
}
<code class="function">dprintf</code>(ID "usb module at %p\n", <code class="varname">usb</code>);

<code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">register_driver</code>(<code class="constant">DEVICE_NAME</code>, <code class="varname">supported_devices</code>, 1,
    <code class="constant">NULL</code>);
<code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">install_notify</code>(<code class="constant">DEVICE_NAME</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">notify_hooks</code>);
</pre><p>
(Okay, you don't have to use <code class="function">dprintf()</code> so gratuitously, but I like to. To
review, <code class="function">dprintf()</code> works just like good 'ol <code class="function">printf()</code>, but it spews its
bits to COM 1 so you can catch them on another computer using a null
modem cable and a terminal program set to 19200 baud, 8 data bits, no
parity, 1 stop bit, and no flow control. This is serial debugging, and
it's pretty much indispensable for driver development. You can turn on
serial debugging by hitting the delete key as soon as the BeOS boot
screen comes up, or during runtime by hitting
<span class="keysym">alt</span>+<span class="keysym">printscreen</span>+<span class="keycap">d</span> to jump
into the kernel debugger, then typing <span class="keycap">c</span> to continue.)
</p><p>
The code above gets a pointer to the USB Manager module by calling
<code class="function">get_module()</code> with the name <code class="constant">B_USB_MODULE_NAME</code>. Then it calls the USB
Manager's <code class="function">register_driver()</code> function to tell the Manager which devices it
would like to receive notifications about. For CPiA, I specify the vendor
and product fields of the usb_support_descriptor explicitly; for more
generic drivers, you can specify something other than the wildcard 0 for
<code class="varname">dev_class</code>, <code class="varname">dev_subclass</code>,
and/or <code class="varname">dev_protocol</code> fields. How can you find out
what the vendor and product IDs of some random USB device are? It's as
simple as plugging the device in with serial debugging turned on. Among
lots of other useful output, you'll see a line like
</p><pre class="screen">
vendor/product id: 0x0553 / 0x0002
</pre><p>
Next, the USB Manager's <code class="function">install_notify()</code> function is called. This
provides addresses of the hook functions that will be called when various
events occur on the USB bus. Currently only two hooks are defined:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
typedef struct <span class="type">usb_notify_hooks</span> {
    <span class="type">status_t</span> (*<code class="varname">device_added</code>)(<span class="type">constusb_device</span> *<code class="parameter">device</code>,
        <span class="type">void</span> **<code class="parameter">cookie</code>);
    <span class="type">status_t</span> (*<code class="varname">device_removed</code>)(<span class="type">void</span> *<code class="parameter">cookie</code>);
} <span class="type">usb_notify_hooks</span>;
</pre><p>
As you may have guessed, <code class="function">device_added()</code> is called whenever a device
matching the <span class="type">usb_support_descriptor</span> provided in <code class="function">register_driver()</code> is
added to the USB, and <code class="function">device_removed()</code> is called when it is removed. You
may not have guessed that <code class="function">device_added()</code> is also called after you call
<code class="function">install_notify()</code>, and <code class="function">device_removed()</code> is called after you call
<code class="function">uninstall_notify()</code>, if the device is connected at those times.
</p><p>
Lastly, CPiA's implementation of <code class="function">init_driver()</code> creates a semaphore to
synchronize access to the information about the currently connected
camera (remember that multiple threads can be executing a driver's code,
so protect that global data!). The semaphore name refers to a "table" of
devices, but currently the CPiA driver only supports one camera as a
simplification. However, next week's version may support more than one
camera, and some code in this version is designed for that possibility.
The number of devices a driver may support has no artificial limit in
BeOS, but there are some practical concerns specific to each device that
should be considered. For example, USB bandwidth is theoretically 12Mbps,
so supporting two 10Mbps USB devices may not work out well.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id442313"></a>publish_devices()</h4></div></div></div><p>
The kernel calls <code class="function">publish_devices()</code> after <code class="function">init_driver()</code> to get the names
by which the driver wishes to be known in the
<code class="filename">/dev</code> hierarchy. CPiA is a
USB video device, so it returns <code class="filename">video/usb/CPiA/0</code> from this function if
there is a device connected at the time it's called. If the driver
supported more than one device, it would be published as
<code class="filename">/dev/video/usb/CPiA/0</code>, <code class="filename">/dev/video/usb/CPiA/1</code>, and so on. Furthermore, a
single driver can publish multiple logical devices of different
functionality if the physical device has such capabilities. For example,
many sound cards also have a MIDI port; a driver for such a card might
publish devices in both <code class="filename">/dev/audio/</code>
and <code class="filename">/dev/midi/</code>.
</p><p>
Before the dev_names string array is filled out, though, it is freed if
it remains filled out from a previous call. The only safe times to free
this array are in <code class="function">publish_devices()</code> after the first time it is called,
and in <code class="function">uninit_driver()</code>. At any other time the array may still be in use.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id442386"></a>find_device()</h4></div></div></div><p>
<code class="function">find_device()</code> is called by the kernel when a potential client calls the
POSIX function <code class="function">open()</code> on a driver, so the driver can provide its
implementation of <code class="function">open()</code> and its friends
<code class="function">close()</code>, <code class="function">ioctl()</code>, <code class="function">read()</code>
<code class="function">write()</code>, etc. It does this by returning a <span class="type">device_hooks</span> structure filled
out with the addresses of its implementations of those functions. If a
device supports multiple logical devices of different functionality as
described above, it should check the argument of <code class="function">find_device()</code> to see
which logical device is being opened, and provide the corresponding set
of hooks. More on the implementation of these hook functions in my next
article.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id442929"></a>uninit_driver()</h4></div></div></div><p>
<code class="function">uninit_driver()</code> is called just before a driver is unloaded by the kernel.
It's the last chance to free resources allocated in <code class="function">init_driver()</code> and
elsewhere. In the CPiA implementation, the <code class="varname">dev_names</code> string array used in
<code class="function">publish_devices()</code> is freed, the USB Manager function
<code class="function">uninstall_notify()</code>
is called to inform the Manager that the driver will no longer be
requiring notifications, the <code class="varname">dev_table_lock</code> semaphore is recycled, and --
lastly—the "connection" to the USB Manager is severed. At this point,
that certain lady has finished singing for the CPiA driver.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id442972"></a>USB Notification Hooks</h3></div></div></div><p>
As introduced in <code class="function">init_driver()</code> above, USB drivers must implement a set of
hook functions that are called when certain events occur on the USB.
</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id442988"></a>device_added()</h4></div></div></div><p>
The main tasks to accomplish in <code class="function">device_added()</code> are creating and
initializing a cookie that contains device state information and
resources, and verifying that the device has the capabilities we expect
and that it is working properly.
</p><p>
The CPiA device cookie is defined in
<code class="filename">CPiA_priv.h</code> and looks like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
typedef struct <span class="type">device</span> <span class="type">device</span>;
struct <span class="type">device</span> {
    <span class="type">usb_device*</span> <code class="varname">dev</code>; <span class="comment">/* opaque handle */</span>
    <span class="type">bool</span>     <code class="varname">connected</code>; <span class="comment">/* is the device plugged into the

    <span class="type">int32</span>     <code class="varname">open_count</code>; <span class="comment">/* number of clients of the

    <span class="type">uchar</span>     <code class="varname">vers</code>[4]; <span class="comment">/* data returned from

    <span class="type">sem_id</span>     <code class="varname">cmd_complete</code>; <span class="comment">/* available on completion

    <span class="type">area_id</span>     <code class="varname">buf_id</code>; <span class="comment">/* ID of buffer for data returned
                         ** from CPiA command */</span>
    <span class="type">void*</span>         <code class="varname">buf</code>; <span class="comment">/* data returned from CPiA command */</span>
    <span class="type">size_t</span>         <code class="varname">actual_len</code>; <span class="comment">/* length of data returned by

    <span class="type">status_t</span>     <code class="varname">cmd_status</code>; <span class="comment">/* result of command */</span>
    <span class="comment">/* temp */</span>
    <span class="type">usb_pipe*</span>     <code class="varname">video_in</code>;
    <span class="type">uint16</span>     <code class="varname">max_packet_size</code>;
};
</pre><p>
The comments should give you a rudimentary idea what each field is used
for. Perhaps the most important field is dev, which is the handle to the
USB stack's notion of the device. It's opaque to clients of the stack,
but must be passed to any USB Manager functions that need to know which
device you'd like to operate on. The fields after <span class="comment">/* temp */ will most</span>
likely be moved to another cookie next week.
</p><p>
For CPiA, I've broken out the cookie creation and initialization process
into two additional functions. <code class="function">add_device()</code> allocates memory for a device
structure and adds it to the device "table," which is currently a single
pointer named connected_device. Again, only one connected device is
supported right now for simplicity. <code class="function">add_device()</code> in turn calls
<code class="function">init_device()</code>, which sets the fields to sane values and allocates the
resources they represent.
</p><p>
If <code class="function">add_device()</code> succeeds, <code class="function">device_added()</code>'s cookie parameter is set to
point to the newly created device structure. This pointer is passed to
the <code class="function">device_removed()</code> USB notification hook so its resources can be
properly reclaimed. It will also be passed to each of the device hooks
described below. Any device-specific data that needs to persist between
USB notification hook calls and device hook calls must live in the cookie.
</p><p>
After successfully setting up the cookie, the CPiA driver issues two CPiA
commands to the camera, to get its version information and to check it
for any errors that may have been discovered during its Power On Self
Test (POST). The workings of <code class="function">issue_cpia_command()</code> will be discussed in
the next section.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id443281"></a>device_removed()</h4></div></div></div><p>
<code class="function">device_removed()</code> marks the device as being removed. If the device's ref
count (<code class="code"><code class="varname">dev</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">open_count</code></code>)
is zero, no clients have the device open, so its
cookie is freed by calling <code class="function">remove_device()</code>,
which calls <code class="function">deinit_device()</code>
to free the cookie's dynamically allocated resources.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id518677"></a>Issuing CPiA Commands</h3></div></div></div><p>
Vision VLSI thoughtfully gave CPiA commands the same format as USB SETUP
packets, which means it's a cinch to issue them to the camera using the
USB Manager's <code class="function">queue_request()</code> function.
</p><p>
First some terminology. USB is completely host-centric and
host-controlled, where "host" means the USB controller to which USB
devices are connected. All movement of data is described with reference
to the host. OUT always means movement from the host to a device on the
bus; IN always means movement from a device to the host. Devices can't
initiate data transfer on their own, nor communicate directly with each
other. All data transfer is initiated by the host.
</p><p>
There are four types of USB data transfers: bulk, interrupt, isochronous,
and control. All USB devices support control transfers and have an
endpoint (a data sink and/or source) dedicated to them. A control
transfer begins with the host sending an 8-byte SETUP packet to the
device. The device may then respond with a DATA IN packet.
</p><p>
As documented in the Software Developer's Guide for CPiA Cameras, each
CPiA command consists of 8 bytes in the SETUP packet format. The first
byte indicates the type of command (whether or not a DATA IN packet will
follow the SETUP packet). The second byte uniquely identifies the CPiA
command. The next 4 bytes can be used individually or in various
aggregations as parameters to the command. The last 2 bytes give the size
of the following DATA IN packet, if any.
</p><p>
The function <code class="function">issue_cpia_command()</code> in
<code class="filename">CPiA.c</code> makes it convenient to issue
a command exactly as it is presented in the Developer's Guide, because it
takes each of the 8 bytes of the command as a separate parameter. It's
really just a wrapper for the USB Manager's <code class="function">queue_request()</code> function.
<code class="function">queue_request()</code> takes the same 8 bytes as parameters, although it
slightly complicates matters by combining the latter 6 bytes into 3
shorts.

The "queue" in its name is a clue that <code class="function">queue_request()</code> operates
asynchronously; consequently, it also takes as a parameter a function to
be called when the transaction is complete. To wait for that completion
before returning, <code class="function">issue_cpia_command()</code> immediately tries to acquire a
semaphore in the device cookie that has been initialized to 0—thus the
call to <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> blocks. That semaphore is only released in the
completion routine <code class="function">cpia_command_callback()</code>, after the requested data (if
any) has been copied into the cookie's buffer.
</p><p>
The strategy of using a zero-initialized semaphore to wait for completion
of an asynchronous function will come in handy again next week when we
start streaming video data from the camera. The CPiA uses isochronous
transfers to do that, and the USB manager has a <code class="function">queue_isochronous()</code>
function we'll use to fill our buffers with pixels.

In addition to the exported symbols, all BeOS drivers must also implement
certain functions that provide the functionality of the familiar POSIX
functions <code class="function">open()</code>, <code class="function">close()</code>,
<code class="function">ioctl()</code>, <code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, etc. I'll call these
functions the device hook functions. As they are accessed through the
function pointers in the <span class="type">device_hooks</span> structure returned by
<code class="function">find_device()</code>, you can name them anything you want (unlike the exported
functions), but it is customary to name them &lt;logical device&gt;_&lt;hook
name&gt;. For example, the hook functions for the MIDI part of a sound card
driver might be named <code class="function">midi_open()</code>, <code class="function">midi_write()</code>, etc. Since CPiA only
publishes one kind of logical device, I'll just use <code class="function">device_open()</code>, etc.
</p><p>
Our time's almost up for this article, however, so we'll discuss the
implementation of the device hook functions in my next article.

The CPiA driver is not very exciting yet. Well, there's a bit more
implemented in the sample code than what I've covered so far, including the
device hooks. Feel free to explore those, especially <code class="function">device_control()</code>,
where you may find some more interesting stuff. The file <code class="filename">test.cpp</code> also
contains the beginnings of a basic test harness we'll use to exercise the
driver. 'Til next time...

After Microsoft's announcement, last week, I received mail regarding the
availability of BeOS on the X-Box. As one correspondent noted, it would
be good, mischievous fun to imagine the effect of BeOS—a true media OS
-- on a dream media platform such as the X-Box. The suggestion gives me
an opportunity to clarify our position, to restate what our focus really
is.
</p><p>
First, though, let's see what we think we know about the X-Box: 600 Mhz
Pentium, 64 Mb of RAM, 8 Gb for the hard disk, DVD player, high-speed
rendering chip from nVidia, 3D audio processor, and I/O for Ethernet,
game controllers, and the like. The X-Box site makes a generic reference
to an x-86 processor, but Intel appears to have won the last round in the
beauty contest (it would be interesting to know the quid pro quo).
</p><p>
As for the software engine, the Wall Street Journal, in its account of
the "rebel" project inside Microsoft, refers to "the core of Windows
2000," or words to that effect. The price wasn't specified, but rumors
peg it around $300, or less. Game developers will have more details soon,
and the product is slated to be available in about 18 months, in time for
the 2001 Xmas season.
</p><p>
At first glance, it looks more like a PC than a game console. Everything
comes from the PC-clone organ bank: the hardware, the software, and this
being Microsoft, the world view. This leads some critics to predict
failure, for cultural reasons. One local wag calls the X-Box Game Bob;
others say that 18 months is a long time, the X-Box is too big, too
expensive.
</p><p>
By contrast they say that the Play Station is a dedicated machine, not a
tricked-up PC. This rehashes an old argument about the advantages of
dedicated hardware versus the benefits of the PC-clone organ bank. The
latter might not always be the prettiest, but the volume and competition
in the PC world make the ecosystem brilliantly efficient. On the other
hand, on a game console, the real CPU is the graphics engine and the
"classical" microprocessor is more an ancillary unit passing display
lists to the graphics chip, an ASIC doing the "real work" of high-speed
rendering.
</p><p>
Back to the question. The X-Box looks pretty close to a PC and promises
exciting multimedia hardware, so isn't it a "natural" for BeOS? For
argument's sake, let's explore the "how" of this. First, we would need
Microsoft's blessing to get the hardware specs, when available. That's
not likely—the blessing, that is, not the availability. This would put
us in the position of doing some kind of reverse- engineering. No thanks.
Life is fun in the Internet Appliance space, where Microsoft doesn't
control much of anything—at least for now, so let's enjoy it.
</p><p>
Of course, one could speculate about Microsoft's motive with this
announcement. Is it offensive strategy to conquer territory, or is it a
defensive maneuver against Sony, Nintendo, and Sega invading the home and
becoming players in Internet access? I'd bet on the latter. By 2001, game
consoles will all offer high-speed, always-on Internet access; there will
be lots of content to view and sell. This would further diminish
Microsoft's efforts to establish MSN as a premier portal for the
Internet. Conversely, a Microsoft game console with high-speed Internet
access is a great vehicle for MSN, for attracting gamers, multiplayer
games, selling music—to name but a few possibilities.
</p><p>
I also noticed another line of speculation. Who will hack into the X-Box,
write drivers, and make it run Windows and Windows applications? I didn't
ask why, but who. In any case, it will be interesting to watch what
happens to the X-Box. Will it be CE'd by Sony, Nintendo, and others? Will
it really give rise to a new industry segment? Or is it just another
paper tiger like the Zero Administration PC, the Net-PC, and the Simple
PC?
