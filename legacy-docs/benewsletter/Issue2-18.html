I've been at Be for close to a year now, and like some of you, my first
exposure to C++ was when I started messing around on the BeOS. C++ is
without question quite a confusing monstrosity of a language; sometimes I
wonder what good ol' Bjarne and his friends in New Jersey were thinking
when they included some of the more arcane aspects of the programming
language discipline in C++. At any rate, it can't be repeated too often
that programmers are well- advised to be very careful when using some of
the more unusual features of the language. This is all the more true in a
multithreaded environment, where what appears to be a safe way of doing
things actually isn't.
</p><p>
Since I'm responsible for maintaining the core libraries for the BeOS,
I've gone through quite a bit of C++ code over the past several months.
Never has reading code been as daunting a task as when I had to pore
through the implementation of the Standard Template Library that was at
our disposal. It was even more daunting when I had to narrow down some
obscure bugs. Based on this experience, I'd like to discourage a practice
that seems somewhat common in the C++ community.
</p><p>
Rule: Don't declare member variables of classes static, if the member
variable is of a nonfundamental type.
</p><p>
This lesson may be hard to understand to those who don't violate it, so
let me present the following situation. Sometimes you need a flag or
counter that is common to all instantiations for a particular class; for
example, a flag to indicate that some common initialization for all
objects of this class has occurred. Often this flag is also a
nonfundamental type, because it has some sort of mutual exclusion built
into it, or some such thing.
</p><p>
I've noticed that many programmers are tempted to declare these flags and
counters as static, private members of the class, so that only one such
object is instantiated for all instantiations of this class itself:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">B</code> {
public:
  <code class="methodname">B</code>();
  <code class="methodname">~B</code>();
}

class <code class="classname">A</code> {
public:
  <code class="methodname">A</code>();
  <code class="methodname">~A</code>();
...

private:
  static <code class="classname">B</code> <code class="varname">flag</code>;
}

static <code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="varname">flag</code> = 0;

<code class="classname">A</code> <code class="varname">obj1</code>, <code class="varname">obj2</code>;

<code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="methodname">A</code>()
{
  if (<code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="varname">flag</code> == 0) {
    do blah;
  }

  <code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="varname">flag</code>++;

  ...
}
</pre><p>
Now this is a perfectly fine idea, except that it opens one up to all
sorts of nasty race conditions.
</p><p>
What tends to happen is that <code class="code"><code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="varname">flag</code></code>
will generally be used in the
constructor for <code class="classname">A</code> itself; after all, the purpose of the flag is to let
<code class="classname">A</code>'s constructor know whether it needs to do any other initialization.
</p><p>
However, notice the circular dependency—the constructor for <code class="classname">A</code> depends
on <code class="classname">B</code>. However, the C++ standard doesn't define an order in which global
objects are constructed. <code class="classname">A</code> therefore depends on an object that may not
yet have been constructed—that is, <code class="classname">B</code>—and then all hell breaks
loose. The value of the flag is unpredictable; it may or may not be
correct at any given time. An identical problem occurs if there's a
dependency between destructors.
</p><p>
This wouldn't occur if object <code class="classname">B</code> was of a fundamental type, such as <span class="type">int</span> or
<span class="type">char</span>, since fundamental types aren't constructed in the canonical C++
sense.
</p><p>
In this type of situation, it's likely that this flag is used in the
constructor for the class of which it is a member. Recall that the flag
was declared static, meaning that it's actually a global object in its
own right.
</p><p>
The solution? Declare the object static and local to the constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">B</code> {
public:
  <code class="methodname">B</code>();
  <code class="methodname">~B</code>();
}

class <code class="classname">A</code> {
public:
  <code class="methodname">A</code>();
  <code class="methodname">~A</code>();
...

}

<code class="classname">A</code> <code class="varname">obj1</code>, <code class="varname">obj2</code>;

<code class="classname">A</code>::<code class="methodname">A</code>()
{
  static <code class="classname">B</code> <code class="varname">flag</code> = 0;

  if (<code class="varname">flag</code> == 0) {
    do blah;
  }

  <code class="varname">flag</code>++;

  ...
}
</pre><p>
Now everything's fine. And as a side benefit, the code's even easier to
understand.

To start off, please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Ed Romson and I'm
the new (three months) Director of Customer Support here at Be. My bio is
on the Web site, so I'll forego any repetition of that except to say that
I'm a recent escapee from Apple (after twelve and a half years) and have
been the support business for about fifteen years.
</p><p>
I'd like to do two things in this short missive. First, I'd like to give
you an update on those things that have been keeping us busy on the
nonengineering side of the company. And second, I'd like guide you on the
path to Support Enlightenment.
</p><p>
The status report first. With the Preview Release looming (no
announcements in MY column), we're working to have all of the operational
aspects of the business in place for that magic day when Mel yells "Ship
it!!" To do this, we've worked through bidding processes for technical
support (Net and phone), printing, disk duplication, order taking (Net
and phone), and distribution. We've picked the vendors who will supply us
with all of these aspects of Customer Support here in the US. We're also
working with Jean Calmon and the Be Europe office to settle the details
on that side of the pond. My commitment at the weekly Be Office Gathering
has been "We'll be ready when you are." We're on track to do just that.
</p><p>
In future Be Newsletter articles and at the Developers Conference (have
you updated your information yet?), we'll be sharing some thoughts with
you about support and showing you how we've designed our support
structure in a way that it can be extended to help developers address
some of their customer service and support worries. Stay tuned.
</p><p>
Our support philosophy starts with providing as much information as
possible to you via the Web and other electronic means. We'll make this
information easy to find and, through the use of the latest technology,
help developers and end users be self supporting. We've been
investigating case-based reasoning and other tools and technologies to
make a Web search quick, easy, and maybe even enjoyable. Watch our site
as we evolve and give us feedback.
</p><p>
The place to start for support of any kind is the Be Web site,
http://www.be.com. There you'll find a wealth of Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQs), sample code, manuals, and updates. We have tutorials,
we have code fragments, we have announcements, and we even have support
documentation in Japanese!
</p><p>
If the information you require isn't there, you'll also find a BeAssisted
form you can use to submit questions to any of the support e-mail
addresses. If you hate Web forms, a generic e-mail to any of the support
addresses will be welcomed. Please help us help you by giving us as much
information about the problem as possible, including the configuration of
your system, what you were doing, what happened, what you expected to
have happen, why, and anything else about your configuration and problem
that you think we should know.
</p><p>
Here is a list of the support addresses and their uses:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
CustSupport@be.com - for questions regarding set up, installation,
configuration, and compatibility of the BeOS, BeBox, or other technical
questions that are not about programming or coding.
</p></li><li><p>
CustServices@be.com - for assistance obtaining any of our products or
for questions about maintenance and warranty of a BeBox.
</p></li><li><p>
DevServices@be.com - available to developers with developer-specific,
nontechnical issues including lost developer passwords, changing name
or company information in the developer database, moving files in the
BeWare section, and the like.
</p></li></ul><p>
If all of this Web searching and e-mail doesn't do the trick and you'd
rather talk to a human, you can call us. We'll be available Monday
through Friday, between 6am and 6pm (Pacific time) for people in the
Western Hemisphere, and between 8am to 6pm GMT for those of you in the
Eastern Hemisphere. Our Customer Technical Support numbers will be
activated on June 15 in the US and July 15 in Europe. We'll publish them
(you guessed it) on our Web site at http://www.be.com/support/index.html.
</p><p>
Several years ago, Mayor Koch of New York had a habit of walking up to
people and asking, "How'm I doing?" Regardless of what you think of the
ol' Mayor, he did get information about what was happening in the Big
Apple. I'd like to do the same, electronically. I know you're not shy
about sharing your thoughts (I read comp.sys.be.misc and BeDevTalk
religiously), but how about sharing some thoughts on the state of Be
technical support? What companies do think provide the best Web-based
support? Are there things in the support arena we could be doing, bits
and pieces we could provide, to make your life easier?
</p><p>
How're we doing? It's Romson@be.com.

George Hoffman's back!<br />
I won the Lottery, speaking of which...
</p><p>
Your heart is racing, you can't remember the last time you slept, ate,
stood up, or blinked. Your knuckles are white, your hair is graying more
by the second. Perspiration is sprinkled on your forehead. Your eyes feel
like they've had sandpaper rubbed across them. Did you actually do that,
or was it your imagination. Your heart is pounding, and you have a deep
feeling of imminent success.
</p><p>
Does this scenario relate to:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li>Stepping up to the altar</li><li>Taking final exams in your Freshman year</li><li>Preparing for your first date</li><li>Making your last-minute changes for DR9</li></ol></div><p>
Software development is many things to many people. For me, it's always
been a passion, never a job. Why would you do something you don't enjoy?
And if you enjoy it, why not enjoy it thoroughly. As you read these
words, you're in an environment that obviously has a computer. If you're
lucky, you're on the beach or another outdoor setting, with a portable
computer in your hands. If you're more normal, you're probably in a
cubicle, office, or at your desk at home. No matter what your situation,
you can only hope to experience the sheer and utter joy of reaching a
much anticipated software release with your kidneys, heart, hair, and
hands intact. At Be we try to under promise and over deliver. When a
release has been as long in coming as DR9, it's often hard to meet
expectations, no matter how well we set them. I've recently been porting
a lot of code to DR9, as well as creating new apps. If you've ever done
much porting work, you know that it can be both frustrating and
rewarding. You probably ported something from the Mac OS, Windows, or
UNIX to get to the BeOS in the first place. Moving from DR8 to the BeOS
Preview Release (what we've been calling "DR9") won't be such a great
transition, more of an evolution.
</p><p>
Over the past few months, many of the Be engineers have shared bits and
pieces of the coming BeOS Preview Release in this newsletter. You'll soon
see the fruits of their labors. And sample apps. As one engineer put it,
there's no better documentation than sample code. We have some, and there
will be more on the way as soon as the baby's out the door.
</p><p>
One thing to pay attention to with the BeOS release that comes at the
Developers Conference is that it's a developer's pre-Preview Release --
in fact, we're calling it the Advanced Access BeOS Preview Release. That
is, at the Developers Conference we'll be giving out a release that won't
have wide distribution beyond the developer community. You'll have a
chance to port or write new code before the BeOS Preview Release goes out
to the masses. In that respect you'll have an opportunity to actually
have products available when the Preview Release shows up in the hands of
the Power Computing and other customers who have been anxiously awaiting
it, and your apps.
</p><p>
There are many changes in the Preview Release. As mentioned previously,
there's much tighter C++ usage. Our use of the language is making for a
much more stable and well-behaved system. There will be subtleties
though. We'll try to point them out where they exist, and of course
provide as many samples as possible.
</p><p>
Our Developers Conference is this weekend, but I managed to get sick last
week, so I won't have that in the way. We even managed to give Yasmin a
good birthday party, and take her on a 30-mile bike ride. Not bad for a
two-year-old and a sick daddy.
</p><p>
Well, Dr. Nine is upon us. I think you'll enjoy it. See you at the
conference.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-18"></a>Nerves</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
In normal times—if there is such thing for a start-up such as ours --
we could be expected to be a little nervous before a Developers
Conference. Add a major release, our most important so far, to the
formula, and you have an event laying outside the usual scale. So we're
more than a little agitated. We're presenting ourselves before a jury of
our peers, software developers whose judgment will determine the fate of
the BeOS, the future of our company. This sounds a little too stiff and,
fortunately, the metaphor quickly breaks down. There aren't too many
lawyers in the room, the dress code is better, and the jury isn't
sequestered. But court metaphor or not, this is an important milestone in
our relationship with application developers. We're going to be tested
and compared.
</p><p>
The dust has settled on last year's discussions with Apple, so this time
we're going to be evaluated on our "unconnected" merits. Inevitably,
we're also going to be compared to Apple's upcoming Rhapsody. The
situation will feature one (temporary) irony: Apple intends to distribute
free OpenStep CDs running only on WinTel platforms at their developers
conference, immediately following ours. There will be one more bias in
the comparison: We'll be compared to the old OpenStep environment, not to
the new composite Apple is developing, blending OpenStep and Mac
features. Nonetheless, we expect the comparison to be useful in
reaffirming our respective positions in the PowerPC family.
</p><p>
OpenStep developed a following in enterprise applications. We target
new-media content developers. See Mark Gonzales' Media OS white paper,
which will be unveiled on our Web site this weekend for the conference.
Or refer to http://www.be.com/developers/whybedev/index.html, the
"Designed for the Next Decade" paper describing our technical and
business goals. I don't expect Apple executives to agree wholeheartedly
with my characterization of the respective roles the two OSes can play,
and I respect the fact that they must promote their emerging blend of
OpenStep and Mac as having the broadest of appeals. As stated earlier,
developers are the judges—followed by customers. And focusing more
creative energy on the PowerPC benefits us all, just as robust Power Mac
compatibles from Power Computing, Motorola, UMAX, and others bring new
energy to the erstwhile hardware monopoly.
</p><p>
Back to the BeOS itself, we're more nervous than we've ever been. This
release brings more change than in any prior release. As a result, we
need the feedback of software developers more than ever. Even more
important than bug reports, we need feedback on the design of the BeOS in
order to transform our weakness, our small size, into a strength, the
ability to react quickly to suggestion. As I wrote before, we're myopic.
Someone taking a fresh look at our work can make the "tractor
suggestion." Of course, there will be embarrassing bugs and humiliating
oversights. Still, we're very proud of this release, and we—nervously
—look forward to this opportunity to show our work to demanding critics.
