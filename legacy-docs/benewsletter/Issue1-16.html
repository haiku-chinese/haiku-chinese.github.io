There are two ways to do animation on the BeBox: Animate directly to the
screen or animate to an off-screen bitmap and render the results to the
screen.
</p><p>
The "direct-to-screen" approach may seem easier at first, and may even be
acceptable for rastered images, but for vectored images or images made up
of multiple rastered images, it usually results in flickery animation.
</p><p>
The "off-screen" approach is easy to implement and results in very smooth
animation, since the user only sees new frames when they're completed --
not the steps required to draw each new frame. Of course there's no free
lunch: The off-screen approach does involve writing about 10 more lines
of code and there's a memory requirement for each off-screen bitmap.
</p><p>
The purpose of this article is to show how easy it is to use the
off-screen approach, using example code for creating a slider that's made
up of two parts: A background and a knob. The example draws the
background from scratch each time, since it's a simple object. The knob
is a canned graphic that we've created elsewhere (see Steve Horowitz's
excellent article in last week's newsletter, "Be Engineering Insights:
craw, shex, and script: Excuse Me?").
</p><p>
(Of course we could draw the slider directly to the screen, but every
time the knob moved, the user would see the background redraw over the
knob and then see the knob drawn onto the new background—not very
pretty.)
</p><p>
The first step is to create the on-screen view that we'll render into in
the window that we've already created:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(<code class="constant">SLIDER_L</code>,
            <code class="constant">SLIDER_T</code>,
            <code class="constant">SLIDER_L</code> + <code class="constant">SLIDER_WIDTH</code>,
            <code class="constant">SLIDER_T</code> + <code class="constant">SLIDER_HEIGHT</code>);

<code class="classname">TSliderView</code> <code class="varname">slider_view</code> = new <code class="classname">TSliderView</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>, "slider");
<code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(<code class="varname">slider_view</code>);
</pre><p>
Since we're using a canned graphic for the knob, we might as well create
a bitmap for it in the constructor for <code class="classname">TSliderView</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(0, 0, <code class="constant">KNOB_WIDTH</code>, <code class="constant">KNOB_HEIGHT</code>);
<span class="type">unsigned char*</span> <code class="varname">knob</code> = new <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>, <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code>);

<code class="varname">knob</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetBits</code>(<code class="varname">slider_bits</code>,
              <code class="varname">knob-&gt;</code><code class="methodname">BitsLength()</code>, 0,
              <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code>);
</pre><p>
(If the original graphic is a 24-bit bitmap, replace <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code> with
<code class="constant">B_RGB_32_BIT</code>.)
</p><p>
The next step is to create the off-screen bitmap that has the same
dimensions as our on-screen view, and an off-screen view that we'll draw
into:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">r</code> = <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>;
<span class="type">unsigned char*</span> <code class="varname">offscreen</code> = new <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>,
                                       <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code>,
                                       <code class="constant">true</code>);

<code class="constant">BView</code> <code class="varname">offview</code> = new <code class="classname">BView</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>,
                          "off",
                          <code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_ALL</code>,
                          <code class="constant">B_WILL_DRAW</code>);

<code class="varname">offscreen</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(<code class="varname">offview</code>);
</pre><p>
Note: When you're creating a bitmap that you intend to attach a view to,
the left and top values for the bounds must be 0.0.
</p><p>
That's it for creating an off-screen drawing environment. Now we need to
draw into it. First we lock the view's parent to prevent anyone else from
accessing it:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">offscreen-&gt;</code><code class="methodname">Lock()</code>;
</pre><p>
Next, start drawing:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">r</code> = <code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>; <span class="comment">// get view's bounds</span>
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetHighColor</code>(R, G, B); <span class="comment">// set view's high color</span>
<span class="comment">// same as on screen</span>
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FillRect</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>); <span class="comment">// fill bitmap with color</span>

<span class="comment">// draw the slider background...</span>
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetHighColor</code>(0, 0, 0); <span class="comment">// set pen to black</span>
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StrokeLine</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(x, y), <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(x1, y1));
.
.
.

<span class="comment">// copy the knob</span>
<code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(<code class="varname">knob_x</code>,
<code class="varname">knob_y</code>,
<code class="varname">knob_x</code> + <code class="constant">KNOB_WIDTH</code>,
<code class="varname">knob_y</code> + <code class="constant">KNOB_HEIGHT</code>);
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">knob</code>, <code class="varname">knob</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>, <code class="varname">r</code>);
</pre><p>
The last step is to render the result to the screen and unlock the view's
parent:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">offview</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Sync()</code>; <span class="comment">// make sure rendering is done</span>
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">offscreen</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(0, 0));
<code class="varname">offscreen</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Unlock()</code>;
</pre><p>
That's all there is to it. Of course, don't forget to delete the bitmaps
that were created in the <code class="classname">SliderView</code>'s destructor. Look for the full
source example of this slider on our FTP site:
ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/Slider.tar.Z (the file is also available in .zip
and .sea.hqx formats).

Ltd.</h2></div></div></div><p>
Last week, Peter N. Lewis of Stairways Software Pty. Ltd. voyaged all the
way to the U.S. from Perth, Australia, just to visit us at Be. Well, OK,
so he also came to spend some time with our friends at Metrowerks in
Texas, but we're pretty sure hitting up Jean-Louis for another BeBox was
his real mission.
</p><p>
Peter N. Lewis may be a familiar name to many of you. A well-respected,
long-time Macintosh developer, he's a thriving shareware and freeware
developer with a long list of Internet applications to his credit. Among
them: Anarchie, an FTP and Archie client, which you can use to browse FTP
sites and upload and download files, and NetPresenz (previously called
FTPd), which you can use to turn your system into an FTP, WWW, or Gopher
server.
</p><p>
As a communications developer running up against the proverbial
performance walls of traditional PC architectures, Lewis believes "The
BeBox has a lot of potential for the future. It's a simple, clean system
—something lots of developers would like to get back to. With its
multiprocessor design, it's also Internet-capable and fast!"
</p><p>
The modern <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™ is also a big draw with its preemptive multitasking
and memory protection. "I write mostly Macintosh communication programs,
and not having preemptive multitasking is a real problem." In addition,
one of the most attractive aspects from a technology adoption viewpoint
is that "the framework is built right into the box, so you don't have to
wait for the framework to catch up in order to take advantage of new
capabilities."
</p><p>
As a shareware developer, Lewis admits that the BeBox isn't a financially
viable platform for him yet. Typically, he finds that only 2 to 20
percent of shareware users take the time to send in shareware fees (he
thinks "about the price of a paperback book"—or $10—is reasonable).
This means a platform needs a large installed base before a shareware
developer like him begins to see black on the bottom line. Even so, he
believes in the BeBox's potential so much that he's already written a web
server for it. And he's feeling "a little guilty" that he can't be doing
more for the BeBox right now, as he embarks on a few-months break from
his work in Australia.
</p><p>
"I hope the BeBox picks up enough users so that I can start to develop
seriously for it. It's certainly a lot easier to program for than the
Macintosh, despite using C++," he says. "And if we get some good
languages on the BeBox, then it will be even more pleasant. I wonder how
hard it would be to build a Java interpreter straight into the OS?"
</p><p>
Why would he recommend other developers consider the BeBox? "Because it
gives you an opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Because it's much
easier than developing for other machines. Because there's no
competition. And because it's fun!"
</p><p>
"As a Macintosh developer, I've heard all the reasons why I should
develop for the PC, but I'm still writing for the Macintosh."
</p><p>
And now, the BeBox.

"All right," they say, "your OS offers some advantages, we'll concede
that. But just you wait, the moment The Big Guys wake up and realize you
have some interesting advantage, they'll unleash their immense technical
and marketing resources. In no time, they'll catch up with you, meet or
beat all your differentiating features. Add their marketing might and
you'll be reduced to a footnote." Thank you, may we go quietly now?
</p><p>
Fortunately for all of us having one kind of stake or another in Be's
future, it's not quite like that. On the contrary, even if it appears a
little counter intuitive, we're more likely to increase our technical
lead than to see our noble and worthy elders catch up with us. This, of
course, makes all sorts of assumptions about us staying focused,
vigilant, hungry, and mindful of our station in life. We have a lot to
prove. With this cautious frame of mind, let's turn to life inside the
sausage factories, to building system software. Call it entropy, call it
politics, but any piece of software inevitably reflects the age, the
mores, the size of the organization that built it. Your coefficients may
vary, but the formula stays the same. And it will apply to us,
eventually. For The Big Guys, large incremental projects need more and
more time between major releases.
</p><p>
Even the best-run company in the business, Microsoft, needed about five
years between Windows 3.0 and Windows 4.0 (as your hard disk knows it --
Windows 95 for us humans). Apple will need a similar amount of time to
move from System 7 to System 8 (a/k/a Copland). For the previous
iteration, the time interval was 2 to 3 years. The same phenomenon
applied to major releases of mini and mainframe operating system
software. After an exuberant youth, software settles down and the
interval between major releases increases. Put another way, the more
mature PC operating systems are entering a phase of diminishing returns,
while we're still on the early, ascending part of the curve.
</p><p>
Invoking "Skunk Works" might sound both pretentious and overused. Still,
Ben Rich's and Leo Janos' book (now in paperback at $14.95, unfortunately
defaced by a Tom Clancy quote...) is a wonderful read—a rich source of
inspiration and analogies. They offer good models when contemplating what
a small, focused organization of engineering demigods can accomplish: The
U-2, the SR-71, the Stealth fighter no less. They also offer sad models,
such as when the immune system built by the founding father, Kelly
Johnson, and carefully maintained by his successor, Ben Rich, was finally
overwhelmed by the corporate and Pentagon lymphocytes. Warehouses filled
with government paperwork for a single project.
</p><p>
Lesser mortals such as ourselves can still enjoy the advantages of a
small organization, happily focused on a product in the early part of its
life cycle—at a time when we can make bigger and faster strides than
our elders. Our developer software release 1.1d7, shipping next month,
will be a test of this statement.
</p><p>
Still, what about Windows catching up with the Macintosh? Doesn't this
destroy our thesis? Au contraire, Microsoft was the smaller company in
those days, while Apple was the big rich target. Admittedly, Microsoft
enjoyed an unfair advantage: Stable management, the same leader for 20
years. This continuity is reflected in the product strategy: Continuous
improvements from QDOS to Windows 95. Apple, on the other hand, had
discontinuous leadership. This wasn't always bad. Jumping from the Apple
II to the Macintosh, while unpopular with some, started what has become a
$12 billion company. But today, Apple is in the uncomfortable position of
playing the continuity game against the best player in the field.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, having sinned and learned in another life, we're committed to
making the best of our discontinuity, of our lack of organizational and
architectural past and baggage.
