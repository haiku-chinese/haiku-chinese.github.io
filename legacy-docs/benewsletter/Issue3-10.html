BeOS Release 3 uses file types much more extensively than Preview Release
2. Since file types have been a mild source of confusion to developers in
the past, and could be more so in the future, this article is an attempt
at reducing the mystery factor.
</p><p>
Application developers need to make sure that file types are set up
correctly. As you know, file types are represented by
<acronym class="acronym" title="Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</acronym> strings, and
applications have a list of all the types they support in their
application info structure.
</p><p>
Dragging and dropping documents onto application icons now works only if
the corresponding application supports the given type or the group
(super-type) the type belongs to. If you drag a document onto an app that
doesn't support it, the icon doesn't highlight. If you drop it, it's the
same as moving or copying it.
</p><p>
The Tracker's new "Open With" feature relies entirely on file types and
the information in the <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> database to do
its job. "Open With" lets you
choose from all the applications that support a given document,
displaying them in a hierarchically ordered menu or <span class="application">Tracker</span> window.
</p><p>
Say you have an application that can edit text files. Let's take my
favorite, <span class="application">StyledEdit</span>, as an example. The native document format of
<span class="application">StyledEdit</span> is 'text/plain', which is listed as a supported type in
<span class="application">StyledEdit</span>'s application info.
</p><p>
However, <span class="application">StyledEdit</span> can open just about any text file, including source
code, HTML, etc., some of which have a different type than 'text/plain'.
Instead of trying to enumerate all the different types of text files in
the list of supported types, <span class="application">StyledEdit</span> lists 'text'—in other words it
lists the entire <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> group as its supported type.
</p><p>
Note, though, that listing 'text/*' does not do the job, since '*' is, in
fact, a valid string representing a sub-type, and it is definitely not
interpreted as a wild card. Several applications out there list similarly
confused file types. You know who you are, and now is your chance to fix
it.
</p><p>
Using the super-type as a supported type this way is convenient for
applications that, for example, use an add-on architecture to open video
files and you can't tell ahead of time which add-ons your application
will end up with.
</p><p>
Back to our <span class="application">StyledEdit</span> example. Even though 'text/plain' is a subset of
'text', you still want to include 'text/plain' in the supported types
list. The new "Open With" feature sorts applications so that those
listing specifically 'text/plain' appear before those that only list
'text'. Also, you may want distinct icons for different file types. In
other words, by listing a specific file type you are claiming to be able
to handle that particular file type.
</p><p>
As a rule of thumb, you should include all the types that your
application can generate and all the types your application can treat in
a special way, even though it already lists the corresponding super-type.
</p><p>
To add a super-type as a supported type in an application, use the good
old FileTypes application. Open your application or the
<code class="filename">.rsrc</code> file you
use to build it, press the Add button and select the super-type that you
want to add (e.g., 'text'). You can also drag the super-type from the
System File Types window and drop it into the list of supported types.
</p><p>
If you have an application that can open any type of document, such as a
<span class="application">ResEdit</span>-style app or a file hex editor, you could enumerate all the
existing file type groups (MIME super-types). Instead though, you should
include 'application/octet-stream' (Generic file) as a supported type.
Applications that list this type are super-handlers that the <span class="application">Tracker</span> lets
you drop any type of document onto.
</p><p>
<span class="application">FileTypes</span> and the new <span class="application">DiskProbe</span> are both examples of super-handler
applications. You'll notice that both show up at the bottom of the list
of suggestions every time you ask to open a document using the "Open
With" feature.
</p><p>
Your application should not include the wild card
'application/octet-stream' unless it can handle any file, and it also
makes sense for it to handle any type. Say you wrote a paint program that
listed 'application/octet-stream', but when you actually dropped a file
of any type other than an image, you got a dialog that "Document 'bla' is
not an image but it has 14359 bytes ..."
</p><p>
Not only would you sooner or later get arrested by the MIME Police for
misusing the super-handler privilege, but users would also despise you
for polluting their "Open With" menu/window with a false claim that your
application can handle the type 'audio/tube-sound' when in fact it
doesn't (don't you just hate all those gizmos that claim to sound like
tubes but don't even come close?). In other words, think twice before you
decide that your application is a super-handler and before you include
'application/octet-stream' as its supported type.
</p><p>
It goes without saying that if you specify a super-type (such as "audio")
as a supported type, you need to make sure your application does in fact
handle any type of that super-type gracefully, and that it won't crash
if, for instance, your application gets to open an audio file for which
there is no add-on. In fact, you should make sure every application can
handle every document gracefully and not rely on the file type mechanism
for factoring out the documents that could make your application crash or
otherwise misbehave. Here are two of the many reasons why:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
File types are not considered when opening an application from a
shell window, for example, when you type in a <span class="application">Terminal</span> window:
StyledEdit /boot/var/swap
</p></li><li><p>
Even though we strongly believe that using file types to control
document opening/drag-and-drop/application launching is a great way to
enhance the user experience in BeOS—and we will be enforcing it more
and more in future releases—we don't want the user to be unable to
open a document just because a file type is wrong or their favorite
application has confused application info. In that case, you can hold
down the Control key while dragging a document onto an application's
icon and the document will be passed to the app for opening, regardless
of the type.
</p></li></ul><p>
Therefore, make sure your app can deal with file types, that it can, for
example, bring up a clear explanation when it is asked to open a document
it doesn't understand instead of crashing.

We've tightened the screws on some of the file type API calls. The MIME
strings used for file types and application signatures can only contain
lower ASCII printable characters. /\&lt;&gt;@,;:"()[]?= are illegal characters.
The API does not let you set the application signature to anything that
does not start with 'application/' and you won't be able to set it to any
of the common file types of an application or executable (seems obvious
but there were apps out there that had it all confused).
</p><p>
All the file type handling code in Release 3 is case insensitive in
conformance with the MIME standard.

Enough about file types. Here's a new Tracker feature that you can
support in your application:
</p><p>
The Tracker now handles drag-and-drop text and creates text clipping
files. Try dragging some text from <span class="application">StyledEdit</span> and dropping it onto the
desktop. Note that the name of the resulting clipping file has the name
of the originating document in it. This is done by adding a hint to the
drag message that <span class="application">Tracker</span> interprets as the suggested clipping file name.
When building the drag message, you can add the hint as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">dragMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_MIME_DATA</code>);

<span class="comment">// add the actual text to the drag message</span>
<code class="varname">dragMessage</code>.<code class="methodname">AddData</code>("text/plain", <code class="constant">B_MIME_TYPE</code>,
  <code class="varname">someText</code>, <code class="varname">someLength</code>);

<span class="comment">// add the suggested clipping file name</span>
<code class="function">draggy</code>("be:clip_name", "my favorite text clipping");
</pre><p>
<span class="application">StyledEdit</span> uses <code class="classname">BTextView</code>,
which has a convenient new call
<code class="methodname">GetDragParameters()</code> that lets you do just that. So if you are already using
<code class="classname">BTextView</code>, you just add the suggested name in the overridden
<code class="methodname">GetDragParameters()</code>.

Finally, here's a little update to Victor's cool article, "Fiddling With
Tracker Add-ons," from the February 4 Newsletter:
http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/volume_II/Issue5.html#Workshop
</p><p>
Some developers have run into this problem. Say you have a <span class="application">Tracker</span> add-on
with a user interface that consists of classes that you wrote/overrode,
for example, you added some special features to <code class="classname">BWindow</code> in a
<code class="classname">MySuperTrackerAddonWindow</code> class. If you use the window in
a <span class="application">Tracker</span>
add-on like this, your add-on will most likely crash mysteriously, each
time probably in a different place:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">process_refs</code>(<span class="type">entry_ref</span> <code class="parameter">someRef</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">someMessage</code>,
                  <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">unused</code>)
{
  ...
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BWindow</code> *</span><span class="type">window</span> = new <code class="classname">MySuperTrackerAddonWindow</code>(...);
  <code class="varname">window</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Show</code>();
}
</pre><p>
What happens is not quite as mysterious as it may seem. You created your
own window and launched it with the <code class="methodname">Show()</code> function. The window goes about
its business in its own thread while your <code class="function">process_refs</code> returns. The
<span class="application">Tracker</span> assumes the add-on is finished and unloads its code while
<code class="classname">MySuperTrackerAddonWindow</code> is still running: The rug got pulled right from
under its feet, er, I mean the program counter.
</p><p>
Obviously, the <span class="application">Tracker</span> could keep the add-on in memory, making it launch
a bit faster the next time. However the benefit of being able to
add/remove/change add-ons on the fly is great, and after all it's the
behavior you expect from the BeOS, right?
</p><p>
The correct way of dealing with this is to wait for any and all of the
threads that your add-on spawned to terminate, in our example:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">process_refs</code>(<span class="type">entry_ref</span> <code class="parameter">someRef</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">someMessage</code>,
                  <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">unused</code>)
{
  ...
  <span class="type"><code class="classname">BWindow</code> *</span><code class="varname">window</code> = new <code class="classname">MySuperTrackerAddonWindow</code>(...);
  <code class="varname">window</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Show</code>();
  <span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">dummy</code>;
  <code class="function">wait_for_thread</code>(<code class="varname">window</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Thread</code>(), &amp;<code class="varname">dummy</code>);
}
</pre><p>
It's a little trickier with multiple threads (for instance more dialogs
open, one for each <span class="type">entry_ref</span>) but I'm sure you get the picture and will
be able to deal with the more advanced cases.

"Greetings, people of earth! You will all worship my band and buy my
records!" Wouldn't it be great if you could tell everyone what to do?
Well, with the BeOS' scripting architecture you can! In preparation for
my upcoming BeDC presentation I needed to brush up on my scripting, so
here's some beginning material to get you started while it's fresh in my
mind.
</p><p>
Scripting on the BeOS uses <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s. This should be no surprise, since
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>s are great containers for commands and data, and can be easily
sent from one application to another. The receivers of <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s are
<code class="classname">BHandler</code>s. They respond appropriately to the message, either by handling
it or passing it on to another <code class="classname">BHandler</code>.
</p><p>
Be uses three main terms in its scripting metaphor: Properties,
Specifiers, and Suites.
</p><p>
Properties are the things in an app that you'd like to control from a
script. Four messages control properties:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="constant">B_CREATE_PROPERTY</code>
<code class="constant">B_DELETE_PROPERTY</code>
<code class="constant">B_GET_PROPERTY</code>
<code class="constant">B_SET_PROPERTY</code>
</pre><p>
Any part of an object can be considered a property. Code handles
scripting messages that SPECIFY that property.
</p><p>
You use specifiers to describe the property you are scripting. A
specifier must name a property as well as an instance of that property
when there is more than one. You can encapsulate specifier data inside
another BMessage. There are seven defined specifier message types:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="constant">B_INDEX_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_REVERSE_INDEX_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_RANGE_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_NAME_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_ID_SPECIFIER</code>
<code class="constant">B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER</code>
</pre><p>
The simplest specifier is <code class="constant">B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER</code>. "Direct" means that the
property name is all that's needed to determine what to return.
</p><p>
Here's a direct specifier message in the making:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">name_msg</code>(<code class="constant">B_GET_PROPERTY</code>);
<code class="varname">name_msg</code>.<code class="methodname">AddSpecifier</code>("Name");
</pre><p>
There are special functions for adding specifiers to a message. If you
try to use <code class="classname">BMessage</code>::<code class="methodname">AddMessage</code>, the specifier will not be understood for
who it is, and we all know what that's like. ;-)
</p><p>
So how do we figure out what properties an object has and what messages
it understands? This is where suites come in. A suite is the description
of the properties an object understands. There are several suites defined
by Be and built into the Be kits. The suites are named in
<acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> style, for
example:
</p><pre class="screen">
suite/vnd.Be-handler
suite/vnd.Be-application
suite/vnd.Be-control
</pre><p>
The suite 'suite/vnd.Be-handler' is the most basic. All BeHandler-derived
objects inherit this basic understanding of scripting messages.
</p><p>
To demonstrate some basic scripting messages, I cooked up a little app
that gets a list of supported suites for all running applications. All
the work happens in the <code class="methodname">FillList()</code> function.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span>
<code class="classname">SuiteListView</code>::<code class="methodname">FillList</code>()
{
  <span class="type">char *</span><code class="varname">name</code>;

I use the global <code class="varname">be_roster</code> to get messengers for the running
applications. Then I send each app three messages: one to get the name of
the app, another to get the supported suites, and a third to get a count
of the windows.
</p><p>
In a future article I'll turn this into a useful app that lets you create
and send messages to a particular app handler.

Or so it seems. A few days ago, we thought we had Release 3 (the
shorthand designation for our upcoming Intel release) nailed. Instead, we
got nailed, and how!
</p><p>
It started with a member of our board of directors. Two weeks ago, after
our first post-financing Board of Directors meeting, we gave Garrett
Gruener a handmade Release 3 CD. He went home happily and proceeded to
install the BeOS on one of his systems. It didn't work. We don't support
the graphics card on his system, yet.
</p><p>
So, the trial changed venues—to a machine graciously proffered by
Garrett's spouse. It turned out that we support her configuration but,
alas, not her data. Somehow, the partitioning tool we used (silently) set
the Windows partition to the new and improved FAT 32 file system, thereby
rendering the partition unreadable by Windows 95 OSR1, which only
understands the august DOS FAT 16 file system.
</p><p>
We know this now, and also how to set a partition back to FAT 16, but
when trouble struck, we thought we had destroyed the data on our
director's wife's hard drive. How to make a good impression and succeed
in the software business. Dominic Giampaolo, a Be engineer who bravely
ventured his technical support services, ended up working through most of
the night and finally succeeded in recovering the data, understanding the
cause of the problem, and feeding the appropriate information to the
people in charge of the partitioning software we bundle on the BeOS CD.
</p><p>
Our "luck" was in testing the installation process thoroughly. I was an
installation guinea pig myself, to make sure the process was
"executive-proof," but even this extreme form of QA wasn't pragmatic
enough. We made an invisible assumption, we used OSR2, the latest Win 95
OEM Service Release, and we got caught. Realizing this, we called the 200
or so recipients of similar CDs. Please, please, if you have OSR1,
proceed with extreme caution. We appreciate the positive feedback we got
by e-mail, phone, and newsgroup posts—many of you obviously "felt our
pain."
</p><p>
But we weren't done yet. I got a brand new "Ming Special," proceeded to
carve out a BeOS partition and install the newly improved Release 3. The
installation stalled. Engineers were called, looked at the system, looked
again, hooked it to a life support system to watch serial port output
during the boot process, fiddled with the BIOS. Nothing.
</p><p>
Then Windows wouldn't even boot. We suspected a hardware problem. As it
turns out, one of our engineers has an identical system and does not
experience the same symptoms. Eventually we discovered that my system
issues a non-maskable interrupt when first reading the real-time clock at
boot time and the kernel doesn't expect it and things gets stuck. Why on
my system? We should count ourselves lucky we caught that situation
inside, and now.
</p><p>
These are all useful reminders of the complexities and the humbling
experiences ahead of us.

The Release 3 BeOS strongly recommends the use of the PC
industry-standard <code class="code">__declspec()</code> directive to import/export symbols. Is
this a sell out (to Microsoft rule)? Fighting words, and shoving ensued.
In a flame abatement effort, young Ficus Kirkpatrick had this to add...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Why are things being done the Microsoft way? Metrowerks is Be's compiler
vendor, and that's what they had available... [furthermore] by using a
format that is supported by tons of compilers already (Borland, Symantec,
Microsoft, the list goes on), it makes the porting effort easier, should
some tools vendor want to start supporting BeOS.</span>”
</p><p>
Cutting through the thicket, Sean Gies asked a practical question:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Will either of these methods [declspec or pragma] compile and link on
both PPC and x86 versions? I would like to be able to write the source
code _once_ and only change compile and link options for the different
platforms.</span>”
</p><p>
And Jon Watte answered:
</p><p>
“Both <code class="code">#pragma</code> and <code class="code">__declspec()</code> works on both PPC and Intel. And, while
__declspec(import) is not strictly necessary for code on Intel, it IS for
data (globals and class statics).
</p><p>
If you want to go with text files, you can create a .exp file for PPC,
and a COM file for Intel. Yes, you need to create two different files,
but then you touch no source.”
</p><p>
In performance land, Marco Nelissen observed that...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...the BeOS [uses] a compiler that I have not once seen listed among the
best, and for good reason. Performance of the BeOS on a P100 is pitiful,
it feels *much* slower than Windows 95 on the same machine.</span>”
</p><p>
To which Dominic Giampaolo replied:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We are aware that performance isn't what it could be. That is partly due
to the compiler and partly due to the fact that we haven't started
tweaking out things on Intel yet. If we made you guys wait until we
squeezed every last ounce of performance out of the software then you
wouldn't be receiving CD's any time in the next 6 months.</span>”

Does the system really generate only one <code class="constant">B_MOUSE_MOVED</code> event for each
four (or so) pixels of movement, as Joerg Stegemann claims? Yes, and for
the reason pointed out by many of our listeners: To avoid overflowing the
message queue.
</p><p>
Listeners wrote in to suggest other <code class="methodname">MouseMoved()</code> implementations and
work-arounds.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: As mentioned in the Be Book: "<code class="methodname">MouseMoved()</code> should not be
used to track the cursor inside a view. Use the <code class="methodname">GetMouse()</code> function
instead."
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id672334"></a>Subject: Standardized resource formats</h4></div></div></div><p>
“<span class="quote">I'm curious to know how other developers are handling the lack of
resource format standards, especially as they relate to the development
of an application's GUI.</span>”
</p><p>
Also sprach Chris Russo. Und...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I've found Be's lack of something similar [to the Mac's ResEdit] to be a
bit disconcerting.</span>”
</p><p>
But shouldn't GUI elements be created by typing code, the way the
ancients did it? Nope—archives are the way to go, according to Tyler
Riti:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The advantage of using resources to build your GUI is that the compiled
code will be much smaller because you're not having to build the entire
interface in C++. Twenty or so function calls suddenly becomes just one
function call to completely build an entire window, interface and all.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">But that's not the only way it can be done,</span>” said Dr. Peter Kittel,
emerging from the shadows with a fresh drink and a helpful smile, “<span class="quote">A
shareable library with the GUI configuration routines can take this load
from the programmer, so that he also has to issue just one call to get a
whole GUI. If done right, he even doesn't need external resources,
perhaps only for localization of his text strings.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Also,</span>” said Marco Nelissen, agreeably, “<span class="quote">although the *compiled code* may
be smaller when using a resource, the actual size of the executable file
shouldn't differ that much.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Another plus of coding it all is that your linker automatically tracks
the relation between the code and the classes it uses,</span>” said Mark-Jan,
joining his compatriots in the atrium. “<span class="quote">It throws out the ones you didn't
use. An 'object-factory' links itself to all classes it can generate,
bloating the code.</span>”
</p><p>
They adjourned to cigars and brandy in the study, where they found Kevin
Hendrickson slowly rotating the large globe in the corner. “<span class="quote">But one huge
advantage of resources is the ease of customization and localization. If
I want my app to have a bigger default window or a purple background, I
(or anyone else) can just edit the resource. If I want my dialog box to
say 'Don't do that!' in Japanese instead of (or in addition to) English,
I just edit a resource. I shouldn't have to recompile for such a simple
thing. This becomes increasingly important as apps get bigger and more
complex with users spread around the world.</span>”
</p><p>
The contestants agreed, or nearly so, that localization strings could be
stored in external files, which, of course, is not without its problems
(multiple files—precisely the bugaboo that resources attempts to
avoid).
</p><p>
A number of respondents wrote in to offer their own resource/localization
tools.

A question from Jonathon Turner:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">How would one do raw read and write from a CD, like for instance if it

</p><p>
Dominic Giampaolo's reply: “<span class="quote">Just <code class="function">open()</code>
or <code class="methodname">BFile::SetTo()</code> the path name
of the CD. You can poke around in
<code class="filename">/dev/disk</code> to find what devices are
available.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id672521"></a>Subject: rgb_color</h4></div></div></div><p>
Naveen Michaud-Agrawal thinks that rgb_color should have a constructor.
Not everyone agrees. Brian Stern suggests that initializing the struct is
good enough; for example...
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="varname">color</code> = { 255, 255, 255, 255 };
</pre><p>
But, Mr. Stern continues, the struct COULD benefit from equivalence
operators.
</p><p>
Jason Gosnell rebuts the initialization method...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">You can't declare [an initialization] on the fly as a temporary:</span>”
</p><p>
<code class="varname">foo</code>( <span class="type">rgb_color</span>(255, 255, 255, 255) ); <span class="comment">// can't do this</span>
<code class="varname">bar</code>( <code class="classname">BRect</code>(10.0, 10.0, 60.0, 60.0) ); <span class="comment">// but w/ BRect, we can.</span>
</p><p>
Also, says Mr. Michaud-Agrawal, you can't re-initialize; if you want to
reuse an <span class="type">rgb_color</span> struct, you have to reset each component separately.
(Mr. Michaud-Agrawal then conceded that what he really wants is a <code class="methodname">SetTo()</code>
method).
</p><p>
Unconvinced, Mr. Stern replied...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote"><span class="type">rgb_color</span>s are 4 bytes each. It makes more sense (to me) to allocate as
many on the stack as you need rather than setting the value of a single
variable back and forth to several different colors.</span>”
</p><p>
Jon Watte suggested that an in-line pseudo-constructor would be even
better than a real constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
inline <span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="function">rgb</code>(<span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">r</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">g</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">b</code>, <span class="type">uint8</span> <code class="parameter">a</code> = 255) {
  <span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="varname">ret</code>;
  <code class="varname">ret</code>.<code class="varname">red</code> = <code class="parameter">r</code>;
  <code class="varname">ret</code>.<code class="varname">green</code> = <code class="parameter">g</code>;
  <code class="varname">ret</code>.<code class="varname">blue</code> = <code class="parameter">b</code>;
  <code class="varname">ret</code>.<code class="varname">alpha</code> = <code class="parameter">a</code>;
  return <code class="varname">ret</code>;
}
</pre></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id672734"></a>Subject: Query-Bug</h4></div></div></div><p>
Dirk Olbertz indexed an attribute, and then wrote, to a node, a longish
string as the attribute's value. A subsequent query seemed to ignore the
file. Why? Dominic Giampaolo:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Indexed attributes have to be less than 256 bytes in length. It may be
that this is not properly documented but this is definitely true.</span>”
</p><p>
Is this limit too low (ask our listeners)? If an attribute value exceeds
the limit, should the first 255 bytes (at least) be indexed? (Currently,
the entire attribute is tossed out of the indexed). How about storing
multiple values per attribute?
