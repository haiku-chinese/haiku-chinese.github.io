As many of you know, Be uses a variation of the Berkeley socket
interface. Writing socket code on the BeBox has been something of a black
art, since our documentation is only a single page! In this article, I
hope to clear up some of the mysteries of Be socket programming. If you
aren't already familiar with Berkeley sockets, then this article will be
extremely boring for you. For the rest of you, this article will be
merely boring.
</p><p>
The most important thing to remember when using Be sockets is that
they're not file descriptors the way Berkeley sockets are. This
difference is felt in a number of ways:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You cannot call <code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, or <code class="function">close()</code> on a Be socket. Use
<code class="function">recv()</code>, <code class="function">send()</code> and <code class="function">closesocket()</code> respectively, instead.
</p></li><li><p>
Be sockets live in a separate namespace from file descriptors, so the
first socket you open is "0". Normally, in UNIX, the first socket is
"3", since "0", "1", and "2" are opened already for standard I/O. So
don't think you've made a mistake when you get back "0" when opening a
socket.
</p></li><li><p>
Unlike file descriptors, Be sockets are not inherited by child
processes, so after a POSIX <code class="function">fork()</code> and <code class="function">exec()</code> call, you lose all of
your socket descriptors in the child process (the parent is not
affected).
</p></li><li><p>
With Be sockets, you aren't limited by the per-team file table space
in the kernel. You can pretty much open as many sockets as you want,
provided you have enough memory.
</p></li></ul><p>
The next point has to do with unblocking a blocked socket call. In a
single-threaded UNIX system, you can do this with a signal, which will
cause the blocking call to unblock. This currently doesn't work under the
Be OS, and signals aren't really a very good way of doing this in a
multithreaded system anyway. So the rule is that any blocked socket call
can be unblocked simply by operating on that same socket in another
thread.
</p><p>
For example, if a socket is blocked on <code class="function">recv()</code>, it can be unblocked by
another thread calling <code class="function">send()</code> on the same socket. (If you don't actually
want to DO anything, call something innocuous like <code class="function">getsockname()</code>.)
Currently, an interrupted read returns a status of -1; in DR8, <code class="varname">errno</code> will
be set to the more descriptive <code class="constant">EINTR</code>. This isn't much different from
single-threaded UNIX, since in order to operate on the same socket when
you're blocked, you must do so in a signal handler that will cause the
blocked call to fail and set <code class="varname">errno</code> to <code class="constant">EINTR</code>.
</p><p>
(For any of you who might be wondering about the thread safety of setting
the <code class="varname">errno</code> variable, you can relax: In DR8, <code class="varname">errno</code> is *not* a global
variable. Through the magic of the C preprocessor and function calls,
<code class="varname">errno</code> returns a value that is unique per thread.)
</p><p>
A Be OS socket blocks if there isn't any data to be read, and unblocks
when data arrives. This is precisely the UNIX behavior, as far as it
goes, but UNIX also lets you specify nonblocking I/O as an option. This
option will be available in DR8: In nonblocking mode, a socket that would
otherwise have blocked will, instead, immediately return <code class="constant">EWOULDBLOCK</code>
(this is the same as System V's <code class="constant">EAGAIN</code>).
</p><p>
Another item worth mentioning is <code class="function">select()</code>. Under UNIX, you can put any
descriptor into the select mask. Typically, the mask only contains two
sockets, but sometimes tty descriptors are thrown in there, as well. The
Be OS only supports sockets in the select mask. Also, it only reports
descriptors that are blocked on read. The write mask always reports that
sockets are ready for writing, even if they may block. (This is something
that will probably be fixed in DR8.)
</p><p>
I recommend avoiding <code class="function">select()</code> if you can, because it isn't really the
right way to do socket programming in a multithreaded system. It's
implemented by spawning a lot of threads that block, and so it isn't any
more efficient than spawning the threads yourself. You should spawn
threads for blocking calls, and use the trick described above (operating
on the same socket in another thread) if you need to unblock any of the
threads.
</p><p>
The next point concerns the netdb functions (<code class="function">gethostbyname()</code>,
<code class="function">getservbyname()</code>, and so on). The only netdb functions that are completely
implemented right now are the host lookup functions, <code class="function">gethostbyname()</code> and
<code class="function">gethostbyaddr()</code>. The others, such as <code class="function">getservbyname()</code> and
<code class="function">getprotobyname()</code>, are minimally implemented now, but will likely be fully
implemented in a future release.
</p><p>
Most of the options that you can set with <code class="function">setsockopt()</code> are not
implemented. Again, these will get implemented in future releases.
</p><p>
An infelicity that will likely be cleared up in DR8 concerns server TCP
code that binds to the address "0.0.0.0". In UNIX, this is understood to
mean "bind to all interfaces." In DR7 of the Be OS, it means "bind to the
first interface you find." Typically, the interface that's found first is
your Ethernet or PPP interface; your server will NOT bind to the local
loopback address of "127.0.0.1". If you need local clients to talk to the
server, then you need to explicitly bind to the address "127.0.0.1" with
another socket. Thus, your server is actually listening on two sockets:
One for the external network and one for the internal loopback network.
</p><p>
In summary, the basic stuff is implemented and many people have been
successful writing network code on the BeBox. If you're porting code, you
may have some trouble with some of the more obscure stuff that isn't
implemented yet, or with the fact that Be sockets aren't file
descriptors. This should be cleared up in future releases, although
making Be sockets real file descriptors is probably a long way off.

I remember the fateful day last fall when I typed "www.be.com" into my
Web browser and was treated to a vision of the future of personal
computing. What I saw and read was breathtaking. I picked my jaw back up
off the floor, wiped the drool off my keyboard, and went back for a
second look. Could it be true? A dual-processor machine, tons of I/O, a
modern OS complete with multiprocessing, multithreading, memory
protection, and an integrated database—all at an affordable price?
</p><p>
The BeBox was the first computer that made me want to give up my
Macintosh. Coming from a Mac-fanatic like me, that's a pretty serious
statement.
</p><p>
I've been working on the Macintosh since 1987, when I co- developed a
HyperCard database program for an archaeology research project at the
University of Maryland. After getting my anthropology degree in 1991, I
plunged straight into—you guessed it—the computer field. What's an
anthropologist doing in computers? I'll let you do the math...
</p><p>
In the last five years, I've developed and maintained numerous research
databases for a military medical project, using mostly Macintosh
computers with statistical analysis done on a VAX. Whereas I started out
doing mostly database development, I've expanded my scope to the much
more exciting world of multimedia development. My current position
focuses almost entirely on multimedia and program development with a
special emphasis on medical and emergency medical readiness.
</p><p>
But I digress. Back to me finding Be on the Web... The BeBox and Be OS
looked like hot stuff—too good to keep to myself—so I walked down
the hall to a friend's office (he's an NT guy) and said, "Point your
browser at www.be.com and check this out."
</p><p>
"Hmmm...interesting...seems a bit like the NeXT though..." he said.
</p><p>
The low price tag and use of the PC-clone organ bank made him take a
second look, but it was when I showed him the Be demo video that he
became a Be-liever. There's nothing like seeing the BeBox in action to
turn skeptics into Be-lievers.
</p><p>
The BeBox presents a unique opportunity for a fresh start. It offers a
clean, open highway to the next generation in personal computing—and
that's where I want to be: Contributing to the growth of a new OS. It's
exciting! The glowing comments in comp.sys.be from Peter Lewis and John
Norstad—two Macintosh developers for whom I have the highest regard --
really caught my attention. If THESE guys are hot on the BeBox...
</p><p>
Not only are the BeBox and Be OS pretty special, but so are the people
behind Be. Developer support is exquisite, in fact, I'd say it's the best
I've ever encountered. Be seems to understand that happy developers are
key to their success.
</p><p>
Currently I develop for the BeBox on my own time, although my employer is
expressing a growing interest in the platform. Right now I'm working on a
text editor and some desktop utility programs to sink my teeth into the
Be OS. I'm particularly excited about the BMessaging capability and
having applications talk to each other and work together. That's the
anthropologist in me.
</p><p>
I'm also interested in supporting a Be Users' Group in the Washington,
DC, area. If you're in the DC area and would like to get together, please
e-mail me at popernak@io.com.
</p><p>
My beret goes off to JLG and the folks at Be. You all have created
something very special. I can't wait to reciprocate.

If you've been reading Be newsletters for a while, it will come as no
surprise that our primary focus is on developers. Today, we only sell
machines to bona fide developers who are enrolled in our developer
program, and we devote all of our sales and marketing efforts to
recruiting and supporting new developers. However, we get many enquiries
from end users, resellers, VARs, and other nondevelopers who want to buy
or resell BeBoxes. So, what are our plans?
</p><p>
By the late fall of this year, we expect tens, and then hundreds, of
interesting new applications to ship on the Be OS and BeBox. For our
sake, and the sake of our developers, we need to have ways to get product
to the end users of these applications and, just as important, ways to
provide hardware and software support. To this end, our intention is to
offer direct mail/web order sales from Be, with Internet- based support,
and to work with qualified resellers who will be able to configure, sell,
service, and support products in specific geographic or application
markets. Market efficiencies will guarantee that direct and reseller
pricing will be very close, so the end user will have a true choice of
how and where to buy BeBoxes. A partnership between Be, application
developers, and resellers will be able to deliver solutions to end users;
there's nothing innovative about this idea, but it has the great
advantage that it's known to work well and to create satisfied customers.
The most innovative aspect will be the cost (and hence price) reductions
that will come from Internet-based software distribution and support
services.
</p><p>
There's a class of end user who doesn't want to wait for applications.
These are the true geeks (and we use that term with affection, as many of
us at Be could easily be described as geeks), who don't necessarily want
to develop applications for others but who want a neat platform to
experiment with. The only reason that we're not offering BeBoxes to this
geek market right now is that we're awaiting FCC Class B approval. We
expect to be able to offer BeBoxes to the geek/hobbyist market in August;
we'll announce it on our Web page and in this newsletter when the time
comes.
</p><p>
We're very enthusiastic about working with the geek market: It's
populated with fearless, creative, and innovative individuals who will
torture our product and its new applications and figure out ways to use
it that we couldn't begin to imagine.

Fifteen years ago the conventional wisdom was that the US computer
industry was about to be streamrolled by the Japanese, in the same way
they had flattened everything else on their path—from cameras to steel
mills, from stereos to autos. They had the determination, the government
support, the technology, and the discipline to conquer any market on
which they set their sights.
</p><p>
In spite of these dire predictions, the US computer industry is doing
very nicely. In some respects it's doing even better than fifteen years
ago: It now virtually dominates Western Europe and has made substantial
inroads in Japan. US domination is even more striking if we focus on
software: Companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Netscape, and Apple own
the OS and application markets world-wide.
</p><p>
If this is the case—if only American software products can succeed --
why do we even bother to evangelize and support developers in Australia,
Iceland, France, or Finland? Are we financing yet another remake of "Beau
Geste," or do we know something the rest of the industry doesn't know?
It's a trick question, which offers little real choice: Foolishness or
arrogance. But the trick is well-known. It's hidden in the assumptions
that are made about the software trade.
</p><p>
We're told that large US companies dominate the software market because
of the huge development and marketing investments required to wage war.
The linchpin of this argument is in its mixing of two notions: "US" and
"large." We simply don't buy this line. Neither US-centricity nor a work
force the size of a small town with a concomitant budget are necessary in
the new software world.
</p><p>
Let's look at the size argument: Does good software require a long and
expensive gestation and a cast of thousands? If you're an established
player updating a legacy application, then yes, it does. That's because
existing programming models have become unendurably baroque, and because
established companies tend to be conservative: They dedicate most of
their resources to conserving their franchise, their existing business,
whether it's application software or an operating system. Individual
authors and small companies have mixed feelings about entering and
playing in the legacy markets; the ocean is wide, but inhabited by nasty
predators that can devour small fish faster than these fish can spawn. A
fresh developer in the office-automation market has to spend roughly the
same amount of time sifting the arcana of a baggage-laden OS as the big
guys, but must do so without the benefit of a large and well-paid squad
of marketeers and spin artists defending the line and clearing some space
on the shelf at Fry's.
</p><p>
Conversely, with the BeBox, one or two individuals can write a major
application in a fraction of the time and cost that it would take on an
older platform: The programming model is simpler, (still) free from
baggage, and code size is correspondingly smaller (by a factor of four or
five). As expected, baggage-free code is also faster code. Admittedly,
developers could harbor a mix of sentiments towards the Be platform:
Exciting and unencumbered, yet unproven. But once we add the Internet,
the leap of faith becomes safer for a larger number of developers in a
wider range of locations.
</p><p>
Some have called the Internet the new printing press. But it's also a
great marketing and distribution equalizer. A software developer in
Finland can promote and deliver an application as easily and quickly as a
competitor in the heart of Silicon Valley. But is the spreadsheet from a
company in San Jose, simply by the fact of the company's location, better
than the one from Helsinki? If you look at the demographics of the US
software industry, you begin to suspect that the last decade of US
domination wasn't entirely home-grown: In a land of immigrants, the
software industry is well-populated by programmers from other countries
(our company, minuscule as it is, is no exception). In fact, the
advantages of developing in the US are mostly historical and coincidental
—it's no great surprise that young, well-paid programmers have, in the
past, jumped at the chance to live in California.
</p><p>
But when programmers can't come to the US, we'll go to them, via the net.
Size and location are no longer the issue. With exciting new technology,
a platform unencumbered by large competitors, with inexpensive market
access, the most important question is: "Who can write the best code?" It
may not be the only question. But it is the first one—before company
size and location.

A number of heavy-traffic threads (notably "Call for type/creator
reorganization") disappeared this week. The help system thread is still
reasonably strong; "GUI/shell replacement" is losing steam. And to answer
a question that was posed in one of this week's threads: Yes, Be does
listen to the suggestions made in BeDevTalk.
</p><p>
More for amusement than anything else, the age of each thread ("NEW",
"WEEK 2", and so on) is announced above the subject line. Older threads
are given first.
</p><p>
Threads topics are given by the subject lines as they appear (literally,
typos and all) in the mail. We don't summarize every thread, so don't
take it personally if your favorite is left out. Better yet: Start a
thread.

This thread has become an HTML battleground. In addition to the staunch

app-specific HTML tags.
</p><p>
We also learned that the perlism "$_" is pronounced "ding- under."

More thoughts on parting the iron curtain that separates shells from
GUI windows. This week: Should the Browser provide a name-only mode
when displaying items in the dock?
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489747"></a>Subject: Virus Software</h3></div></div></div><p>
How should the BeBox protect the motherboard from a virus that's loaded
into the EEPROM? Latched (once-per-boot) access to the EEPROM was
suggested.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We're working on it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489765"></a>Subject: Browser Add-ons</h3></div></div></div><p>
Where should the add-ons that apply to a particular Browser item be
displayed? Currently, you have to right click and descend the "Add-ons"
submenu. It was suggested that the add-ons should be in the item's
top-level context menu. Should this decision (submenu versus top-level
menu) be settable in a preference?
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489782"></a>Subject: OpenDoc</h3></div></div></div><p>
A few participants lauded the concept of OpenDoc, and have suggested
that some of the BeBox's "missing features" would be filled in by
supporting ODF. The ensuing negative reaction was countered with a) a
request for more descriptive evidence of ODF's flaws and b) the
suggestion that designing something better is possible, but, given that
OpenDoc exists today, spending the time to design the alternative may
be a waste.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489800"></a>Subject: record_ref Persistence?</h3></div></div></div><p>
This thread started with questions: Are record_refs values maintained
through a database reindex? (Yes.) Through a database rebuild? (No.)
</p><p>
It then moved into a larger discussion of what a record_ref actually
identifies, whether you should use refs instead of names, what sort of
user prefers symbolic (that is, ref- like) identification as opposed to
filenames, how refs and filenames compare when fit into the live query
world, whether refs are simply new-fangled gizmos that will never
replace the reality of pathnames, and so on. A pleasantly heated
discussion on a topic that is, after all, at the heart of one of the
selling points of the Box.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489817"></a>Subject: Write a mailer!</h3></div></div></div><p>
Jon Watte (Metrowerks) outlined a command-line mail-sending program and
opined that it would probably be a one-night hack to get the thing
working. A five-minute (shell script) implementation showed up a few
days later; also, news of a mail server was posted.
</p><p>
Woven throughout was a discussion of what Be's mail API should look
like, and what mail services Be should provide. (A branching thread
about add-ons is summarized below.)
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Be will provide a mail daemon and mail API with DR8.
Nothing terribly fancy—we're not out to compete with our developers
—we just want to provide a base level of support for certain features
in the SMTP/POP world.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id489847"></a>Subject: Add-ons</h3></div></div></div><p>
Within this thread (sprouted from "Write a mailer!") were technical
descriptions of how add-ons work, how to tell CodeWarrior to share data
between add-ons, and so on, as well as a discussion of whether/where Be
should allow a repository for "global" add-on modules, whether
script-like manipulations (provided by an add-on) should be performed
