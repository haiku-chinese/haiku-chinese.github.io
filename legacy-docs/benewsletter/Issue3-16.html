A few months ago, I wrote an article on how to export C++ code from an
add-on ("Writing add-ons in C++",
www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue102.html#Insight). The article
described the fundamental issues of name mangling and object
instantiation. There was also some sample code, but it was fairly
abstract. With this article, I'd like to show you some code that's a more
practical demonstration of C++ add-ons.
</p><p>
The code I'll be playing with is a modified version of HelloWorld
(/optional/sample-code/HelloWorld on the Release 3 CD). I won't show the
entire project here—we'll just be looking at the modifications—so
you may want to open up the status quo project on your local machine.
</p><p>
In our modified HelloWorld, the app's <code class="classname">BView</code>
object (<code class="classname">HelloView</code>) is loaded
from an add-on file (which we'll call <code class="filename">HelloViewAddon</code>). Because the
HelloView code lives in an add-on, we don't need the <code class="filename">HelloView.cpp</code> and
<code class="filename">HelloView.h</code> files, so they're
removed from the project. The only change
we make in the remaining code (i.e. in <code class="filename">HelloApplication.cpp</code>/<code class="filename">.h</code> and
<code class="filename">HelloWindow.cpp</code>/<code class="filename">.h</code>) is to change
the <code class="classname">HelloWindow</code> constructor so that it
loads the add-on and instantiates the <code class="classname">HelloView</code> object:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

The add-on consists of its own project that contains the HelloView.cpp/.h
files, somewhat modified, that we removed from the HelloWorld project.
HelloView draws a line of text but it doesn't respond to user actions, so
we only have to rewrite the Draw() function.

Don't forget:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Select "Shared library" as the project type.
</p></li><li><p>
On PPC only: set "Use #pragma" under project Settings/PPC PEF.
</p></li><li><p>
The add-on has to be named "HelloViewAddon" and must live in a
directory that's listed in the ADDON_PATH environment variable.
Typically, you create an "add-ons" directory in the application
directory, and put the add-on there.
</p></li></ul><p>
This simple example shows how to make a program modular and extendible.
Instead of loading a fixed add-on, the application could look in a
directory for all available add-ons. Almost anything can be imported as
an add-on: views, windows, menus, young Swedish women. What's important
is to take care in designing the interface between your application and
the add-ons that it imports.

Originally, this article was written in the immediate aftermath of the
BeDC. But schedules change (even at Be), so I apologize if some of the
highlights of the developer conference have already receded into the
mists of memory—although I hope that isn't the case.
</p><p>
The BeDC offered a number of opportunities for everyone involved—some
obvious, some not so obvious. We all trust that you felt you benefited
from the sessions, and from meeting with the Be Team and with your fellow
developers.
</p><p>
As I stood on the stage in the closing session and looked out on all of
you, I realized another part of the Be "magic." Not only do I work with a
group of talented people, I also work with a *multinational* group of
talented people (a French CEO, and an English VP of Marketing only begins
to give the game away). Be has 15 (or so) nationalities/ethnic
backgrounds represented in its work force, and, although it is a small
company, it is very aware of its place in the world.
</p><p>
As you read this I'll have travelled to (and returned from) our Paris
office, which handles our European business (and most significantly) our
European developers. Do you care that I spent Easter in Paris (no
probably not, and since the trip included a visit to Euro Disney in the
*snow*, do not feel too envious!)? However, our small band of merry men
and women in Paris (and our slightly larger band in Menlo Park) present
some interesting opportunities to our developers. How so?
</p><p>
Right now Be conforms to previous historical examples of new operating
system companies. We have a small (but loyal and growing) band of small
(but very talented) developers, all of whom see the advantages and
opportunities of our new operating system. However, one advantage you may
have missed—perhaps because it's not technical (no brilliant soaring
through the galaxy demonstrations)—is that we quite firmly grasp the
opportunities, and complications, of a world market. We should do, after
all, since we are from all over the world.
</p><p>
Christophe Droulers from Be Europe mentioned this briefly in his BeDC
session, but I'm here to give it a louder airing right now: Let those of
us in Be Europe help all the North American developers find markets in
Europe for their products. And, since the Atlantic Ocean is a two-way
street, let those of us at Be Inc. help all the European developers find
markets in North America for their products.
</p><p>
My colleagues in Paris and the rest of us on Frank Boosman's Developer
Relations staff communicate regularly, and enjoy sharing our experiences
of new software from our developers. Furthermore, we enjoy demonstrating
that software wherever we can, be it at a large exhibition or to a small
user group.
</p><p>
However, our assistance can go much further than simply being
demonstrators-at-large for your product. Given its small size, Be already
makes use of third-party companies to assist in customer support and also
distribution. In Europe SITEL performs these roles for us with a talented
and Be-aware staff (who are just as multilingual as many of us at Be).
</p><p>
For those of you thinking about porting or creating a piece of software
for the BeOS, Europe also has an enviable pool of development talent. A
quick glance down the BeWare submissions list, and a glance at recent
winners of the Be Masters awards, shows just how many talented
individuals there are in Europe. Telecommuting is just one way to make
use of such talent in far off places.
</p><p>
The world is a large place and I'm proud to work in a company which seems
to gather a fair-sized chunk of it in a single office. It's also a large
market and we can help all of you find a place in it. I hope you enjoyed
the BeDC and I hope to see you and those who couldn't make it this time
at the next one in the Autumn (Fall for those of you from the left-hand
side of the Atlantic).
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevWorkshop3-16"></a>Developers' Workshop: Script the Vote!</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Stephen</span> <span class="surname">Beaulieu</span></span></div></div></div><p>
A Yahoo Online survey became quite a topic of interest and discussion
here at Be last Thursday. Our friends at Yahoo posted a survey asking
readers to vote for their favorite operating system from the following
choices: Windows, Mac OS, Unix, BeOS, PalmPilot, and Nintendo 64. As a
company we were gratified that our OS was listed specifically, especially
when other popular choices were stuffed into a generic Unix category. We
were a bit puzzled, though, with the results that first appeared.
</p><p>
With roughly 50,000 votes cast the Mac OS was leading the pack by a large
margin. The breakdown was Mac OS 62%, Unix 19%, BeOS 9%, Windows 7%,
Nintendo 64 2%, and PalmPilot 0%. This seemed odd, given market realities.
</p><p>
On closer examination we discovered that there was no limit to the number
of times that a given person or machine could vote in the poll. Yahoo had
no "One Person, One Vote" security in place. In short, stuffing the
ballot box was, if not legal, certainly possible.
</p><p>
Since the policy seemed to be "Vote Early, Vote Often," and the Mac
Evangelists had more than a three-day head start in stuffing the ballot
box, we decided to take drastic action. The "Script the Vote" campaign
was born.
</p><p>
Early in the campaign we got tired of the "Tally My Vote" --&gt; "Back
Button" --&gt; "Tally My Vote" strategy. At least, we got tired of doing
this by hand. But since the BeOS in general, and NetPositive in
particular, is highly scriptable, we soon gave our mouse fingers a break.
</p><p>
Here is the original script submitted by the engineer in charge of
scripting:
</p><p>
"Try this script: (It's more complex than hoped because of some goofy
behavior in the "Back" button of NetPositive). This assumes that the
window in question is the first NP window and that the radio_button for
the BeOS is already selected."
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="varname">i</code>=0
while <code class="constant">true</code>
do
  <code class="varname">i</code>=`expr $<code class="varname">i</code> + 1`
  echo "iteration $<code class="varname">i</code>"
  doo NetPositive set Value of View 6 of View 0 View 4 of
    View 1 of Window 0 to 1 &gt; /dev/null
  sleep 6
  doo NetPositive set Value of View "back" of Window 0 to
    $<code class="varname">i</code> &gt; /dev/null
  sleep 4
done
</pre><p>
This significantly improved our voting rate, and freed our engineers to
deal with other, possibly more important, issues. But it didn't seem to
satisfy the more rabid ballot stuffers on staff. Further investigation
revealed that the survey itself was managed through an HTTP GET request.
In other words, all the voting information was contained in the URL
itself. Simply scripting NetPositive to constantly hit the Reload button
increased speed dramatically.
</p><p>
But it *still* wasn't good enough for some of us. If it was just a matter
of submitting a URL, why not write a full-fledged voting application? So,
while I started working on the VoteBe app, Ficus Kirkpatrick took another
crack at a scripting solution. He wrote a bash script that launched
multiple copies of lynx, the text-only browser, and submitted requests.
</p><p>
Those of you in the know might realize that there is no port of lynx for
the BeOS. We must in all honesty reveal that at this stage of the game
much of our voting came from five or so Linux boxes <span class="type">float</span>ing around the
company. The same script would have worked wonders on the BeOS, if a
version of lynx had been available.
</p><p>
At this point we were, through our various enterprises, submitting BeOS
votes at a rate of 60-70 a second. Needless to say, our percentage of the
pie increased greatly (just over 20% at its peak).
</p><p>
But all good things must end, and as is often the case, our VP of Sales
and Marketing, Alex Osadzinski—ever the voice of maturity and reason
at Be—was the killjoy. (Hi, Alex 8^) He noted with some unease that
"Le Grand Fromage" would probably be displeased with our morning's
efforts, and that perhaps our energies would be better spent elsewhere.
We assented, and turned our attention to voting for Nintendo 64 (still a
measly 2% of the vote at this time). This was not exactly what Alex had
in mind, but nobody gets their way all the time.
</p><p>
So now Nintendo 64 picked up quite a bit of momentum. After an hour of
voting it had about 17% of the pie. Then disaster struck: Yahoo's voting
server became unresponsive. Connections had slowed down as time went on,
but now we could get nothing. Fearful that we had crashed Yahoo's server,
we pulled our voters away from the ballot boxes and went back to work.
</p><p>
An hour or so later we happened to check the site again and discovered to
our surprise that others had also championed the cause of Nintendo 64.
The N64 vote was at 30%, with the Mac OS down to 31%. N64 was so close to
becoming the Internet OS of choice that we mobilized the voters again to
push it over the top.
</p><p>
We did end up pushing the Nintendo 64 platform to 38%, ahead of the Mac
OS, but it appears that Yahoo has adjusted their figures to compensate
for our ballot stuffing. You can view the final results here:
</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://features1.yahoo.com/survey/tally?Dir=survey&amp;Tmpl=19980413.html&amp;Id=199804%2013&amp;Count=5&amp;MaxWidth=100&amp;Strip=1">http://features1.yahoo.com/survey/tally?Dir=survey&amp;Tmpl=19980413.html&amp;Id=199804 13&amp;Count=5&amp;MaxWidth=100&amp;Strip=1</a>
</p><p>
So, where was I during all of this? After the initial shutdown of the
Yahoo server, I stopped doing real work on my VoteBe application. I had a
very primitive version that submitted votes to the PoorMan server running
on my BeBox. It worked. When we started up the voting again I used it for
awhile, but it was never distributed to the company as a whole.
</p><p>
But, with my Newsletter article deadline looming, I decided that this was
a fun story to tell and that, after beefing it up a bit, my voter
application would make a fine bit of basic sample networking code. So,
point your favorite ftp client to...
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/network_kit/VoteOften.zip
</p><p>
...and download this example of how to write a simple, threaded BeOS
networking application. (Note that the use of this program and its
derivatives should be reserved for special voting occasions. It is very
uncool to use software like this to pound a server that has not asked for
it. Be kind and don't try this one at home.)
</p><p>
On an entirely different subject, I want to remind you that Be is still
looking for qualified engineers to fill many different positions. A full
listing of available jobs can be found at
http://www.be.com/aboutbe/jobs/index.html.
</p><p>
Note especially that we are still looking to fill a DTS Engineering
position. As you can guess from the vote-o-rama story, this is a very
serious place to work.
</p><p>
I'll be back in four to six weeks with more sample code. In the meantime,
enjoy our regularly scheduled Developer Workshops, and look for the first
article from our newest DTS Engineer, Michael Morrissey, sometime very
soon.

A number of betas for Windows 98 have been circulating for a while. As a
registered Microsoft developer, I got the Release Candidate 0 in the
latest shipment of my MSDN subscription and installed it on one of my PCs
in the office.
</p><p>
The procedure is painless and very automated. It appears to faithfully
keep old Windows 95 settings and shows pleasant attention to details. For
instance, the installation program asks you to restart your computer,
then offers to do it for you after 15 seconds, assuming you're bored or
on a coffee break.
</p><p>
The only glitch I encountered was that the system didn't respond to my
shared (via a switchbox) keyboard and mouse when Windows 98 first started
"for good" after completing the updating process. Mysteriously, the
problem disappeared after I hit reset and rebooted.
</p><p>
Windows 98 doesn't behave very differently from Windows 95, unlike the
bumpy transition one experienced when moving from 3.1 to the modern 95
version. The user interface is smoother: nice gradients on some windows'
top bars, animations with menus. Perhaps more important, Windows 98 now
supports multiple monitors without the need to resort to high-wire
tricks, something the Macintosh has done for awhile—and something we
plan to do for R5.
</p><p>
Does Windows 98 make a big difference? As many industry observers have
already explained, one can get most of the Win98 feature set in the
latest '95 service release, a few additions available on the Web, and
Internet Explorer 4.0. Put another way, Windows 98 provides a nicer
integration (a questionable word in some locales) of already available
features. By now, the integrated browser with e-mail client and news
reader is a non-event.
</p><p>
More interesting is the use of an Internet connection to keep your system
updated. Before, one could do this by hand; now it is automated, or
semi-automated. Your permission is required to inspect your system, and
download and install the new and improved application and drivers.
</p><p>
This is nice. It is likely to make customers happy and configurations
easier to maintain. It might even lower the cost of supporting these more
stable configurations. This is a more gratifying aspect of Web
integration than the desktop channels most Explorer 4 customers turn off
or never look at. Oops, I just read in news.com, honest, Microsoft will
let OEMs ship Windows 98 with the channel bar hidden.
</p><p>
On the Be side, if you look at BeDepot and Software Valet, you can see
the implementation of a similar concept. It will be interesting to watch
the large-scale Windows 98 implementation for good and bad ideas to
stimulate our own thinking. Of course, the higher degree of
semi-automated intimacy between Microsoft and its customers will raise
questions. Is this another case of leveraging the knowledge and control
of the platform into an unfair or unbreakable advantage?
</p><p>
Still on the topic of better integration, the Universal Serial Bus is now
even more "official" than in the latest Windows 95 OSR2.1 "with USB
support." USB devices have been slow to come to market, probably as a
reaction to the delays with Windows 97. No one wants an unsupported
product clogging the distribution channels. Hopefully, with Windows 98,
USB devices will become a market reality.
</p><p>
This, in turn, will help us: configurations with richer I/O will be
easier to put together, something we'll enjoy as we develop our
specialized audio-video platform. With a little bit of luck, the broad
deployment of USB will kill off the pesky ISA bus.
</p><p>
On the performance side, we heard Windows 98 was going to speed things
up. This appears to be true: on two identical systems, Eudora, Explorer,
and Outlook Express do appear to launch faster. Booting the system, on
the other hand, doesn't appear to have gained anything. And when it comes
to video performance, Windows 98 doesn't show much improvement when
compared to Windows 95, or to the BeOS.
</p><p>
Running Windows and BeOS systems side by side shows the advantage we
enjoy in A/V applications when capturing, mixing, and rendering several
streams. It is this kind of side by side demonstration that makes the
simplest case for the BeOS: a specialized OS coexisting with the
general-purpose Windows, complementing it in A/V applications where its
general nature and its Office Automation roots put it at a disadvantage.
</p><p>
At an investor meeting this week-end, one participant who saw our
demonstration, stated that this was well and good but, doesn't Microsoft
have a successful history of fixing their problems and catching up with
the innovators? See fourteen years of Microsoft eating into the lead
Apple used to enjoy with the Macintosh.
</p><p>
That is very much on our mind—and was when we started our company.
Operating system go through life phases. They improve very quickly during
their youth, they mature, get comfortable, and start aging. Depending
upon their genes, their parents, they age at different speeds, with more
or less grace—but they all age.
</p><p>
Microsoft has stated Windows 98 is the last Windows "classic." For a
while, Windows NT has been positioned as the "professional" Windows for
robust, enterprise applications. The party line is that the version of
Windows after 98 will be a "consumer" version of NT 5.0. This is entirely
possible, and it probably won't change the complementary relationship
between the general-purpose Windows and the specialized BeOS.
</p><p>
According to Microsoft officials quoted in Information Week a few months
ago, NT 5.0 sports more than 25 million lines of source code. For
reference purposes, with the usual caveats associated with such
comparisons, the BeOS still weighs in well below a million lines. If the
NT 5.0 stats are accurate, we are more than one order of magnitude apart.
</p><p>
We won't do what they do best in enterprise and office automation
applications. Conversely, the maturing 98 and the robust NT may not
axiomatically catch up with us in a few areas where we perform rather
nimbly. Of course, we realize we have much to do and much to prove in
order to convert our potential advantage into a successful market reality.

An initial application announcement was rescinded when it was pointed out
that the implementation may not be signal-handler safe. Be should publish
a list of functions that *are* handler-safe (suggests Chris Herborth).
Olaf Seibert claims that...
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">According to the C standard, the only thing that you are allowed to do
in a signal handler is change global variables of type <code class="code">volatile
sig_atomic_t</code> and return.</span>”
</p><p>
Popping up a bit, Gerardo Diaz Cuellar asked a few questions:
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id685347"></a><a id="id685349"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What's a signal?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
It's an asynchronous 'message' that's handled by your app through the
invocation of an (app-designated) "signal handler" function.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id685363"></a><a id="id685365"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
How are signals sent to an app?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Whenever your code returns from a system call, and every time the
scheduler considers your thread for execution, a check is made whether
there are any signals pending.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id685379"></a><a id="id685382"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
What happens if an app doesn't designate a signal handler for a
particular signal?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
The system defines default behavior for all signals; for most signals,
the default behavior is to simply kill the app.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id685396"></a><a id="id685398"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
So what sort of apps need to handle signals?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
In general, only apps that have "special needs." But Chris Herborth
suggests that it might not be a bad idea to include signal handling as
idiot protection:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Imagine a situation like this:...user has focus-follows-mouse turned
on,...starts app from Terminal...bumps mouse [so it's] over Terminal
[but] doesn't notice that top window doesn't have focus...whacks ^C
intending for some keyboard shortcut to go off, and the program instead
vanishes (due to an uncaught SIGINT...)</span>”
</p><p>
Mr. Herborth's suggestion launched a mini-controversy about what an app
should do when handed a SIGINT. He later added this:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I'm not suggesting that 'real' BeOS applications should ignore SIGINT
(or other deadly signals), I'm suggesting that they should quit
gracefully</span>”
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id685443"></a>Subject: Attribute storage requirements</h4></div></div></div><p>
Chris Tate wants to know how to calculate the disk storage for a set of
attributes. Dominic Giampaolo responds:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">In general if your attributes are small and there aren't lots of other
attributes associated with the file (i.e. besides BEOS:TYPE) then there
is zero extra storage used because you attributes will wind up in the
fast-attribute area. The fast attribute area is slightly over 700 bytes
in size. The size needed for an attribute is the size of the name of the
attribute, the size of the data and 8 bytes for overhead.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If your attributes do not fit into this fast attribute area then they
will require 1 disk block for the i-node of the attribute and at least 1
more disk block for the data. At some point in the future I may store the
data of an attribute in the attribute i-node if it is small enough
although that's a far-off kind of thing.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">And just in case anyone is thinking about it, there is not, nor will
there be a way, to request that attributes go into the fast attribute
area as doing that would expose too many details of the implementation of
BFS in the higher level API which is a bad thing.</span>”
</p><p>
Mr. Tate asks: Does the 1+1 disk block business really mean (at least) 2
blocks for *each* attribute that doesn't fit in the fast area?
</p><p>
Dominic answers: Yes (with a concession that this isn't great, but...)
</p><p>
Mr. Tate asks: [Does the] attributes' indexed/non-indexed state...affect
this?
</p><p>
Dominic answers: No.
</p><p>
Kenneth Flaxman asks: Aside from using extra storage, are there reasons
to try not to exceed the 700 byte fast-attribute area?
</p><p>
Dominic answers: No. Whether an attribute uses the fast attribute area or
not is _completely_ transparent to application programs. There are no
other differences.
</p><p>
David Evans asks: Can an attribute be split between the i-node "cache"
and other blocks?
</p><p>
Dominic answers: C'mon, I'm crazy but not _that_ crazy :-)

Patrick Lantz wants to squash the OS pirates that sail the FTP seas:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">If Be Inc, added a BAD Sector or a unstable 0/1 on a sector on the CD,
and the installer checked for the bad Sector / Unstable Sector when
installing most of the illegal copies will disapper.</span>” [sic]
</p><p>
Marco Nelissen thinks the check would be futile:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...some guy with too much time on his hands would spend an hour
disabling the check. Copy protection doesn't work.</span>”
</p><p>
Angus Mackay finds solace in disinformation:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...the solution is to covertly get someone else to do an equal crack
that sometimes does something bad. 1 time in 10 nuke all the data on the
disk it's being run on or something. Then people will fear the crack and
only the die hard crackers will use it.</span>”
</p><p>
Yeah, well, uhm...okay. Oh gosh, look at the time, I really have to go.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id685594"></a>Subject: Realtime priority idea</h4></div></div></div><p>
Chris Russo has a solution to the runaway realtime thread problem:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">How about a 'Allow real-time processes?' checkbox in some control panel?
Then, the user could decide whether to allow the machine to be taken
over.</span>”
</p><p>
But, Jon Watte points out, the priority isn't the problem:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote"><code class="constant">B_REAL_TIME</code> priority is there for a reason, and if you only use it when
you should, you won't hog anyone's machine. It's all these compute bound
threads with high priority that slow the machine down. Even high non-
real-time priorities suck away responsiveness.</span>”
</p><p>
Mr. Watte also pointed out a little known fact:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">With the CURRENT scheduler, if a thread has a priority that is 16 or
more higher than the others available, that thread will always be
scheduled, and will thus in effect act like a realtime thread... This
behaviour may change later. Or it may not. Stay in the 5-20 range for
best effect.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id685652"></a>Subject: Proposed UI feature request:</h4></div></div></div><p>
How about <span class="type">double</span>-clicking an app icon (in Deskbar) to unhide the app's
hidden windows (suggests Roberto JP)? Jon Watte thinks the current "Show
All" in the Deskbar app menu is good enough (and avoids the "it's a
single-click, oops, nope, it's a <span class="type">double</span>-click" problem).
</p><p>
Same topic, different angle, from Hanan Y Jacob:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">...perhaps u only want it to show the windows that were open in the
current workspace... otherwise were u to open four tracker windows in
four diff. workspaces then hit show-all you would be spun round through 4
workspaces which i dew find irritating.</span>”
</p><p>
(Actually, u don't spin round all those workspaces.)
