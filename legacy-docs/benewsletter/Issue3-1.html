BeOS releases for PowerPC processors have been shipping for around two
years, right? So why on earth is it taking so long to get an x86 release
out? Just recompile it and ship it—come on!
</p><p>
It's amusing to examine the factors involved in porting a shippable
product to a new processor architecture. The x86 project was actually
started in mid-1996, when Dominic Giampaolo created a working kernel
bootstrap. Much of the dirty work remained to be done (page table
management, program loading, etc.) but we did have some Be code running
on an x86 processor.
</p><p>
At the time, however, Be was playing "Lets Make A Deal" with Apple, and a
compelling PowerPC release was pretty important. The PowerPC version of
Developer Release 8 loomed large, and all engineers were caught up in the
maelstrom of getting that release out the door. Dominic switched over to
creating the new file system that shipped in the Preview Release—a
more than full time job for the next several months. Thus, the first
attempt at the x86 port died on the vine.
</p><p>
In January 1997, a new effort at an x86 port began. Two engineers from
outside the company holed up in a cube, took a snapshot of what was then
a rapidly changing source code base for the Preview Release, and set off
on an excellent porting adventure. Aided by Cyril Meurillon and Mani
Varadarajan, they had a working kernel in a couple of months. Soon they
were loading and running command line programs using the shell over a
serial port.
</p><p>
Having outside engineers do the work proved beneficial in many ways. They
had expertise in x86 processor architecture that Be engineers did not,
and they were focused exclusively on the port, while the rest of Be was
working on the massive changes for the Preview Release.
</p><p>
Taking a source snapshot and hacking away is great for getting something
running quickly. Rather than being subject to the vagaries of the daily
build, the porting engineers worked with a known quantity. All problems
were theirs, not something introduced by a midnight check-in gone awry.
Once they had something running, though, their sources were several
months out of date.
</p><p>
Several competing forces come to bear on what happened next. As the
Preview Release neared its final testing phase, merging all the x86
changes was deemed too risky to that schedule. But since Be was embarking
on a major fund raising effort, having a demo of the x86 release was a
necessity. The old source snapshot, while stable, did not have the pizazz
of the Preview Release. We decided to take another, current snapshot,
merge the x86 changes, and get the road show demo ready as soon as
possible. Cyril, Mani and Pierre Raynaud-Richard took over the merge
effort and soon had a relatively stable version up and running. This
version was shown to investors, and to the general public at Boston
Macworld in August 1997.
</p><p>
Finally, after the Preview Release 2 source tree was frozen, the x86
changes were merged into the main source tree for all Be engineers to
share. This was a tricky process, because kit, graphics, and application
engineers were developing primarily for the stable PowerPC version. They
needed a reliable build every day. However, the x86 changes to the kernel
and elsewhere were many and varied, and typically needed to be done all
at once to work correctly. It often seemed as if we were trying to change
engines on a moving train.
</p><p>
The August demo version was very compelling, but a few critical features
were missing. There was no support for shared libraries, so all
applications were statically linked. In this form the average application
was huge—the /boot/beos directory alone was over 300 megabytes of
object code, without fonts or other such fluff. The disk had to have a
Linux partition on it, as we used the Linux bootstrap loader "lilo" to
start the BeOS.
</p><p>
We spent the next few months working on our dynamic loader, and working
with Metrowerks to resolve compiler and linker issues. The peculiarities
of the import/export mechanism for the PE-COFF object file format
necessitated more massive changes to our header files. All this was done
under the dual constraints of keeping the PowerPC version building and
stable on a daily basis, and also keeping the PowerPC version binary
compatible with the shipping Preview Release versions.
</p><p>
Stability, booting issues, and expanded hardware support have also been
at the fore this fall. Two recent additions to the kernel team, Arve
Hjønnevåg and Dmitriy Budko, contributed significantly. Arve joined Be
one week before Cyril took a well-deserved vacation, and dove right into
the labyrinth of endianness problems, compiler bugs, and hardware
incompatibilities. We scarcely noticed Cyril was gone! Dmitriy brought an
extensive knowledge of the various chipsets, standards, and undocumented
quirks in the x86 world from his previous job at Intel. Much of the
improved hardware support, as well as selective use of chipset-specific
features is a direct result of his efforts.
</p><p>
We continue to work on the final features for the upcoming x86 release.
Every Be engineer now has a PowerPC machine and an x86 machine side by
side on their desk. The nightly automated build is done for both
platforms. When you look at a monitor, it is almost impossible to tell
which version is running.
</p><p>
If we had dropped everything a year and a half ago and focused
exclusively on the x86 version, it would have shipped long ago. The
pressures of continuing to ship PowerPC versions, coupled with the need
for compelling products to demonstrate to potential partners and
investors, have pushed back the release date. Now we are getting close,
and we hope you'll find our efforts worth the wait.
</p><p>
(By the way, this was written using StyledEdit on x86, and sent using
BeMail and the net_server to our Newsletter editor.)

to make a New Year's Resolution)</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Mark</span> <span class="surname">Van Alstine</span></span></div></div></div><p>
In perusing the Newsletter archives, I've noticed that not a whole lot
has been said about (or done with) printing on the BeOS. Fortunately, I
will be rectifying this in the coming months by designing a "new and
improved" BeOS printing architecture. (After all, it's what I was hired
to do... };-&gt; ) So, to start the ball rolling, I'd like to talk a little
about my ideas for the future of printing on the BeOS.
</p><p>
First, however, my general purpose disclaimer and engineering excuse #4:
What I will be discussing are my ideas about printing. They are not
commitments for new printing features, enhancements, or bug-fixes. It is
simply too early in the design process to talk about specific feature
commitments and (gasp!) schedules and such. So much for CYA-speak. Now
what about printing?
</p><p>
The first thing everybody should be aware of is that a lot of things will
change. The printing API and BPicture will be modified, as will the way
printers are added and chosen. Of course, some things won't change. For
example, there will still be a Print Server and add-on printer drivers.
The print job will still take the form of a spool file.
</p><p>
As for new features, it is easier to simply list them for now. Here are a
few I've come up with so far:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
ICC profile-based color matching
</p></li><li><p>
Encapsulated graphics support
</p></li><li><p>
Direct-to-printer job streaming
</p></li><li><p>
Print-time application interface from add-ons
</p></li><li><p>
Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) support
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated PPD and PPD-like printer description support
</p></li><li><p>
Attributed spool files, print queues, and printer scripting
</p></li><li><p>
Random page-access spool file
</p></li></ul><p>
As noted above, one of the fundamental changes affecting the BeOS
printing architecture deals with BPicture. Basically, BPicture will
incorporate a function callback table whose elements map to all the
existing (and new) primitive drawing instructions on playback. This
allows the picture format to be abstracted, so that it can be modified as
needed by Be without unduly affecting applications. (In short, don't mess
with picture internals, or else.) Printer add-ons, for example, will be
able to take advantage of this design by installing bottleneck functions
for any desired graphic primitive that they wish to translate, modify, or
image themselves when a page of the print job is played back.
</p><p>
Another issue (a pet peeve, really) I'd like to touch on deals with
encapsulated graphics support. I've talked to a couple of application
developers and invariably they ask (aside from "When can I expect
printing to work?") about PostScript support a la Macintosh picture
comments. Admittedly, there is a certain perverse appeal to being able to
inject PostScript into the job stream to tweak things to one's
satisfaction. Be that as it may, however, to these people I amicably say,
"Read my lips: No, no, and no!"
</p><p>
My experience with helping develop the LaserWriter 8 printer driver for
the Mac OS leads me to believe that application developers invariably
make hacks that end up decoupling the graphics state a driver generates
from the actual graphics state in the printer when the job is executed.
The result is typically catastrophic, and almost always the printer
driver is blamed for it. Given that similar problems exist in the PCL
world, the best solution I can think of is to allow only encapsulated PDL
graphics to be included in a picture.
</p><p>
What are encapsulated PDL graphics? For PostScript printer add-ons, it
would be Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPSF). For PCL printer add-ons,
it might be HP-GL/2 files. (In the event that the BeOS images the job,
encapsulated graphics wouldn't be supported, as the application should
convert the graphics to BBitmap objects and image them with
DrawBitmap().) Regardless, the application is responsible for loading the
encapsulated graphics; calling the appropriate printer info APIs to make
sure it is the right kind of graphic for the targeted printer/printer
driver; and calling the appropriate encapsulation API which, when
picked-up by the add-on via the callback table, will allow the add-on to
bracket the encapsulated graphics with graphic state saves and restores.
This should prevent the application from inadvertently blowing away the
add-on's graphic state.
</p><p>
Finally, I would like to again point out that these disjointed musings
are simply my ideas on future BeOS printing. Some of them will likely end
up as part of the BeOS. Others will undoubtedly end up in the bit-bucket
where they belong. What I ask of all you developers out there is not only
your criticisms of my ideas, but also your ideas about printing! What
printing features do you need that I might not have a clue about?
</p><p>
There's a window of opportunity here for developers to have a some input
on how printing works on the BeOS. That window, however, is swiftly
closing, as I will need to shift from designing to implementing in the
next month or so. So speak now or hold your peace until the next big
revision.

The engineering articles in the next few issues of the Be Newsletter will
almost certainly concentrate on features that you'll find in Release 3.
Without stealing my cohorts' thunder, here are some rumblings:
</p><p>
Look for a wagonload of <span class="application">Tracker</span> improvements, among which:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<span class="application">Tracker</span> will remember the correspondence between windows and
workspaces such that when you reboot your machine, your restored
windows will be placed in the correct workspaces.
</p></li><li><p>
When you open a folder window that's already open in some other
workspace, the folder window will be brought to the workspace that
you're in (and removed from its present workspace).
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="application">Tracker</span> will let you drag a text selection from a document and drop
it on the desktop; a file will be created to contain the "clipped"
text. If you then drag the clipped text file and drop it on an open
document, the text will be pasted at the insertion point.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="application">Tracker</span> will be scriptable. You'll be
able to ask for the <span class="application">Tracker</span> for
specific windows, examine their contents, create or extend a selection,
and so on.
</p></li></ul><p>
Speaking of scripting:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The suite of scriptable objects has been expanded. Of particular
note, you'll be able to talk to a window's menus and play with its
controls.
</p></li></ul><p>
And speaking of windows:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The <code class="classname">BWindow</code> class will let you create window "sets". A particular
window can be told to float (or be modal to) all the other windows in
its set. You'll also be able to float a window above the other windows
in the same app, or above all windows on the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> has divided its notion of
"type" (bordered, titled, floating,
etc.) into "look" and "feel". You'll be able to create a window that
has (for example) a titled "look" and a floating "feel".
</p></li><li><p>
You'll also be able to sort window layout front-to-back through a new
<code class="methodname">SendBehind()</code> function.
</p></li></ul><p>
MIME support has been improved:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
In compliance with the MIME spec, MIME string comparisons will be
case-insensitive.
</p></li><li><p>
The MIME-knowledgable classes (<code class="classname">BMimeType</code>,
<code class="classname">BNode</code>, <code class="classname">BAppFileInfo</code>) will
be smarter about the relationship between supertypes and their
subtypes. For example, you'll be able to ask a type whether it's
"contained" within some other type.
</p></li><li><p>
The <span class="application">FileTypes</span> app will let you draw icons for specific MIME types.
</p></li></ul><p>
Some odds and ends:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The <code class="classname">BTextView</code> class will provide a simple, single-branch undo
mechanism, and will give you a hook so you can install a more
complicated system.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="classname">BListView</code> will let you sort, swap, and replace items.
<code class="classname">BOutlineListView</code> will let you perform these tricks to the list at
large, or to a single branch of the tree.
</p></li><li><p>
The Node Monitor will send a notification if an attribute is added or
removed from a monitored file.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="application">NetPositive</span> is even more positive. Look for frames, Java, and (my
favorite) scrolling memory: When you click "back", the returned-to page
is automatically scrolled to the place where you left it.
</p></li></ul><p>
And, of course, this will all run on a slightly wider audience of
processors.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee3-1"></a>San Francisco MacWorld</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
During the Xmas break I received a few e-mail messages asking why we were
participating in the annual San Francisco MacWorld. What are you doing
there? I thought you guys were moving to Intel processors, this is a
PowerPC show. That's one way of looking at it. Our perspective is, of
course, a little different.
</p><p>
First, we have a PowerPC version of the BeOS, and a partner, UMAX,
shipping Power Mac clones bundled with the BeOS. UMAX also makes
Intel-based PCs and we'll show the BeOS on these machines, too.
</p><p>
Second, the San Francisco MacWorld is an excellent venue for us to gain
additional exposure; it's close to home, and many attendees are just the
kind of creative, enterprising users we'd like to attract to our software
platform. The BeOS adds value to both PowerPC machines and Intel-based
systems. This fact, and for whom it is relevant, are more important
issues than what hardware the BeOS runs on.
</p><p>
Some correspondents were aware Apple had officially turned down our
request for technical support to port the BeOS to the latest G3-based
Power Macs. They asked what our response was and what it meant for the
future of the PowerPC version of the BeOS. Well, we're still scratching
our head. We'd be happy to add a little value to Apple's hardware, but
we're not interested in engaging in reverse-engineering efforts, or in
public controversy, over this issue. As for the future of the Power Mac
version, as long as we have willing partners, and developers and
customers for it, we'll continue to make it available.
</p><p>
But all this leaves out the most important reason why we're at MacWorld:
BeOS developers—both current and future ones. With our current
developers, we'll be showing off what can be done on our platform, which
we expect will stimulate new developers into writing software for the
BeOS.
</p><p>
For the latest news on this topic, please point your browser to
http://www.be.com/developers/, to the section on BeOS developers and
applications—many are available for sale and/or test drive at BeDepot,
http://www.bedepot.com/.
</p><p>
This said, in the future, our intent is clearly to promote our
Intel-based product. So we'll exhibit at Software Development '98 next
month and, in June, at PC Expo in New York City. I guess we'll know we're
doing the right thing when we get mail asking why we're showing a PowerPC
version at such an Intel-dominated venue.
