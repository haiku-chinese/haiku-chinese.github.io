The Be OS uses two levels of indirection to convert a raw key generated
by a PC keyboard into a character. The first level of indirection is in
the keyboard driver, where the keyboard's scancode is converted into a
raw key code. The scancode mapping table is fixed and cannot be changed.
Basically the raw key codes follow the design of the keyboard from the
top row down, going left to right, with key one being the top-left key
(Escape) and key 101 being the bottom-right key (period on the numeric
keypad).
</p><p>
The second level of indirection occurs in the app_server, where the raw
key code, combined with any active modifiers, is converted into the final
character. The app_server mapping tables can be remapped either
temporarily, by modifying the tables in memory, or across boots, by
placing a mapping table in the
<code class="filename">/boot/system/settings</code> directory.
</p><p>
The app_server uses nine different mapping tables to map the raw key code
into the final character. The mapping tables, in order of priority are:
control table; option-caps-shift table; option-caps table; option-shift
table; option-table; caps-shift table; caps-table; shift table; and no
modifier table. As you can see, the modifier keys that are active when
another key is pressed indicate which mapping table is used.
</p><p>
In addition to the raw key code mapping tables, there are a modifier-key
mapping table and dead-key mapping tables for the following accents:
acute, grave, circumflex, dieresis, and tilde. See the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheInterfaceKit-2.html">Interface Kit</a>
chapter in
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/index-3.html">The Be Book</a>
for a description of the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheInterfaceKit_DefinedTypes.html#key_map"><span class="type">key_map</span></a>
data structure.</p><p>
To remap the character of a given key, you must first determine what the
raw key code is. This can be determined by: 1) counting out, from one,
the key on the keyboard; 2) using the <span class="application">FontChart</span> application, which
displays raw key codes; or 3) referring to the key map in The Be Book.
Then you decide for what modifier keys the remapping takes effect, locate
the key map in shared memory (using the <code class="function">system_key_map</code> call), and set the
new value. Changes take affect immediately and apply system wide.
</p><p>
To remap a modifier key, simply set the appropriate modifier field in the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheInterfaceKit_DefinedTypes.html#key_map"><span class="type">key_map</span></a>
data structure to the raw key code. For example, to swap the
caps-lock key with the left-shift key (which some people prefer), set the
<code class="varname">caps_key</code> field to 75 and set the <code class="varname">left_shift_key</code> to 59.
</p><p>
Dead keys are special keys that require two keystrokes, the first one for
an accent and the second for a character. They're mapped using a
matched-pair table, where the first entry is the completion character and
the second is the generated character. The first matched-pair entry is
special, in that it determines what the dead key is and also contains the
generated character when the space character is the completion character.
There are 15 additional entries to map up to 15 accented characters (all
unused entries must contain 0).
</p><p>
To make changes that apply only when your window is in the foreground,
override the window's
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BWindow.html#BWindow_WindowActivated"><code class="methodname">WindowActivated</code></a>
method, remap the keys when activate is <code class="constant">true</code>, and restore the
system default map (using <code class="function">restore_key_map</code>) when
activate is <code class="constant">false</code>. To make your changes apply every
time you reboot the BeBox, simply save the <span class="type">key_map</span> data
structure into a file called <code class="filename">Key_map</code> in the <code class="filename">/boot/system/settings</code> directory.

"What's with you Be-ers? You're missing an opportunity to be as
innovative with your user interface as you are with your operating system
and your hardware."
</p><p>
Interesting comment. I'll use it as an opportunity to shed light on some
of the ideas behind our work and, perhaps, invite more comments and
suggestions.
</p><p>
Once upon a time, bit-mapped screens, pointing devices, icons, windows,
and menus were invented, creating a revolution in the communication
between humans and computers. As with any revolution it had its
partisans, opponents, undecided, zealots, ayatollahs, and, soon, the
usual dissidents and sects. Quarrels got heated, people and companies
accused each other of plagiarism, lawyers got rich, journalists had juicy
stories—but today, that revolution is over. It left its imprint on the
meaning of user interface, however. The term is mostly associated with
visual properties. This is too restrictive.
</p><p>
User interfaces are in the business of quickly creating a myth inside the
user's mind, a model of how the computer works. Then the user steps
forward and walks on water, the system is faithful to the myth, the user
never falls in the water as the programmer is always under the surface
supporting whatever move the master makes. No need to belabor the
distance between this ideal and today's reality, we are far from the
intuitive and infinitely docile computer. But we can point to a couple of
areas where we think we bring a little progress.
</p><p>
Multithreading is one. It makes the computer more available to the user,
more responsive, more able to manage concurrent user (as opposed to
computer) activities. And computing power, multiprocessing, a lighter
operating system all help. We all know how hard it is to return to a
sluggish system. I often use a vintage 1988 Mac IIx. It keeps reminding
me of the role performance plays in the user's experience. The database
engine at the heart of our system is another example. My brains hurt when
I look at the hard disk on my Windows system or on my Mac.
</p><p>
Inexpensive Internet connections make the situation worse. This is a nice
opportunity or our database engine to help both programmers and users
make more sense of huge volumes of data, locally or on-line.
</p><p>
Going back to an old debate, command-line versus point-and-click, we
think of it as a useless one. Some things are better accomplished by
dragging an item from one folder to another, others are better
accomplished by typing an expression in a shell window. Or, if you
prefer, some users will never grep, others are very comfortable with that
style of interaction. If (and it is sometimes a big if) the system
doesn't suffer, why not offer the flexibility of both styles? On a
slightly different but related vein, we believe full manipulation of
windows and menus—sticky menus—from the keyboard as well as the
mouse is a good idea. Depending on one's perspective, we lack
originality, or we practice heresy, such as using the right button on the
mouse. Flexibility and ease of use is what we're after. The fact someone
else thought of it first shouldn't be a problem—short of misusing
intellectual property.
</p><p>
About a decade ago, a luminary pronounced windows passè. Not really. More
than mimicking pieces of paper on a desk, they cater to the universal
need for separating contexts. Computers used to be too rigidly modal, as
one felt caged in a predefined tree of text menus. Hence the noble call
to modelessness. But as one of my more pithy associates remarks,
supplying hygienic examples, humans are very modal and generally relate
activity to a specific context.
</p><p>
Other technologies haven't come to pass yet, but offer hope. This is the
case for voice and handwriting recognition. Both have great potential for
changing the way we interact with computers. With a more recent operating
environment, we'll be in an excellent position to integrate them when
they make the transition into stable technologies that work every time,
just like spreadsheets did in 1979.
</p><p>
So we've been conservative thus far, not looking for novelty per se, but
for performance, simplicity, and a consistent style. For the latter,
we've asked help from a well-known graphic designer, Bruce Browne, who
designed icons and the overall look of our interface. We're a little
partial, of course, but we like the friendly, colorful face he put on our
work. Bruce asked me to clarify he had nothing to do with the color of
the BeBox...
</p><p>
Earlier in this article I wrote we were in a good position to integrate
new technologies. This applies just as well to feedback and suggestions.
Our newsgroup (comp.sys.be) is a lively place, and several of us at Be
read the posts and respond on a daily basis. In fact, user interface
discussions didn't wait for our newsgroup, they started while we were
still hosted by <a class="ulink" href="news:comp.sys.powerpc">comp.sys.powerpc</a>.
Many feel it's an important topic, one
where a new company with a new system is more likely to listen than
older, more established organizations.
</p><p>
On this and other matters, we'll be happy to demonstrate NIH isn't being
reinvented here.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-6"></a>Be Developer Profile: Charles Turley</h2></div></div></div><p>
Even on the cutting edge, there's still room for nostalgia. Just ask
Charles Turley. The retired molecular biologist from Brisbane,
California, is still in love with his Apple II. In fact, he loves all of
the Apple machines-even the Apple III, which nobody (possibly other than
Turley) has thought about for years.
</p><p>
But even with his nostalgia for computers gone by, Turley is fascinated
by the BeBox. Turley is head of a loosely knit, nonprofit consortium of
Apple users and developers, called 1WSW-CA. That stands for "One World
Software Wizards-Cyber Angels." They go by the acronym because another
group on the Internet is claiming the title "CyberAngels."
</p><p>
Turley sees in the BeBox an opportunity to serve all of those disaffected
Apple II users, while at the same time creating an opportunity for Be's
baby to play in mainstream computing. 1WSW-CA is planning to develop
emulators that will allow the BeBox to run the software for virtually any
computer Apple has ever made, from the Apple II to the Power Macintosh.
</p><p>
"As Apple has discontinued computers over time, I saw the need to serve
the people who still own those computers," Turley says. "Apple will
probably phase out the 68K machines to promote the PowerPC. That just
makes sense. That leaves 20 million people with no place to go. We're
going to support them. That's our motivation."
</p><p>
He also argues that producing a Power Macintosh emulator will help Be
sell more computers. Turley won't say which emulator the group plans to
work on first. But he says they expect to have a product on the market
eight months after they get hardware from Be.
</p><p>
Today there are about 20 in 1WSW-CA, working on a volunteer basis.
They're spread around the world, connected through the Internet and
through the group's site on the world-wide web
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wco.com/~3d5d1wsw/1WSW.CA.Home.Page.html">http://www.wco.com/~3d5d1wsw/1WSW.CA.Home.Page.html</a>). The group includes
a broad cross-section of people: Retired scientists (like Turley),
medical doctors, software engineers, and students from high schools to
Ph.D. programs.
</p><p>
As a nonprofit organization, 1WSW-CA doesn't expect to make money on its
products. They're just doing it because they love computers.

What a busy few months! The world has known of the BeBox since October
1st of 1995, and in those three months we've been flooded with questions,
comments, and nearly 1000 applications to be a Be Developer.
</p><p>
We're very happy, and very gratified, that so many of you think that we
can be a platform for your great ideas! I'd like to give you a little
update on what's been happening in the developer enrollment process.
</p><p>
We had roughly 100 BeBoxes to allocate to those 1000 applications. That
meant that we had to make some hard choices for first recipients, since
we did not want to raise expectations and then not be able to follow
through.
</p><p>
Our criteria for selecting those initial machine recipients was to select
the first 300 or so that had ideas that focused on the unique
capabilities of the BeBox, applications that exploited multithreading,
dual-processor calculations, and so on.
</p><p>
Of course, even with that as a selection criteria we had a great many
more applications than we had machines, so we pared our list down by
selecting developers with different backgrounds. We offered membership in
our developer programs to developers from Fortune 500 companies, 3-10
person companies, shareware developers, and university students. Our goal
was to have a broad range of applications, experience levels, and market
segments.
</p><p>
As you can imagine, those first 100 BeBoxes went fast! Our production
capability is ramping up, so we're now able to offer BeBoxes to more and
more developers. By the time you read this, we should have provided you
with costs and details on enrolling in our developer program. This offer
will arrive in your e-mail mailbox, so if you don't hear anything from,
us please write to dev@be.com to make sure we have your current e-mail
address. We won't be able to fill all the requests for a while, so please
be patient! We're filling requests as fast as we can, in the order
they're received. If you request more than one BeBox, your second (or
third, or...) will be shipped after all developers have gotten at least
one machine.
</p><p>
And don't worry if you can't participate in the program right now! Our
rule is "once a developer, always a developer!" so no matter when you
decide to enroll in the program, you can still be part of our developer
family.

Thanks to so many of you for visiting our booth at MacWorld SF last week!
Many people came to congratulate and encourage us. What a warm and
pleasant welcome to our first big show. It really energized us to keep
working hard on our products.
</p><p>
A lot of visitors said we had one of the most crowded booths at MacWorld.
This may be not too far from the truth... Some figures: We had a 10 x 20
foot booth, around 35,000 people stopped by, we handed out more than 8000
data sheets or information kits, and we gave away around 7500 "We Be
Geeks" pocket protectors!!!
</p><p>
We ended this week with our "Geekfest '96" on Saturday. One hundred
thirty-five people attended this, our first Be developer conference.
</p><p>
We hope you enjoyed getting to meet the entire Be team. This exchange was
fruitful and encouraging, and we certainly enjoyed meeting all of you and
answering your questions.
</p><p>
Your ideas and applications are the energy that will fuel our mutual
success. Thanks for sharing your great ideas with us!
