Although everyone at Be has demonstrated the BeBox at one time or
another, it's safe to say that when the score sheet is tallied, the
author's name will loom above all others in sheer number of demo
performances. This isn't necessarily a statement that I would like to
have scrawled on my forehead in green ink, but it does place me at a
vantage from which I can offer a few suggestions that you might want to
consider when you demonstrate your own BeBox to your friends and
colleagues.
</p><p>
We've spent a lot of time writing about and discussing the features and
capabilities of the BeBox, with its dual-processor hardware and fresh new
operating system. However, by far the best way to truly understand what
makes the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™ unique is to see a demo.
</p><p>
I like to start a demo by stroking the magic chicken bone that I hold
between the second and third toes on my right foot. Then I turn to the
Browser. Besides being an obvious choice on a freshly booted box, the
Browser is reasonably self-explanatory; this helps people to relate (and
compare) what they're about to see to machines they've already used. A
good way to do this is to open and close a few folders. Not only does
this demonstrate the hierarchical file system, which is a touchstone for
most folks, it also gives people a feel for the general responsiveness of
the Be OS.
</p><p>
Next, I like to drag a folder window around the screen, thus
demonstrating our "live" windows: As the window moves, its contents move
with it—there's no "outline dragging." Resizing a window is next;
again, the window's contents are updated as more or less of the window is
displayed. As you're doing all this, you can explain that the live
windows are implemented without the use of a "backing buffer," that each
window is running in a separate thread, that when you resize a window an
"update" is automatically generated, and each background window updates
its contents asynchronously.
</p><p>
As a sobriety check, mention the database (lock the doors first). Use the
Browser's Find panel to easily construct a query—I like to look for
all files greater than 900K that contain the letter 'e'. When the query
window opens, display the files' path names by choosing the Path item in
the window's Fields menu. This demonstrates that the file and folders
were collected from all over the hard disk. Double-click a path name to
open the named file or folder, and change the name of that file or folder
so it no longer meets the query criteria. Like magic—or like a
well-crafted integrated database—the file is removed from the query
window. This can be inordinately impressive, so do it a few times.
</p><p>
Step up the tempo a bit: Open the Mailbox icon and start a movie. While
the movie is playing, start a piece of audio mail. (See page 90 of the
"Be User's Guide" if you don't have any movies or sounds in your
Mailbox.) Once the movie and sound are going, show that the system is
still quite responsive by opening a few folders and pulling down some
menus. This quick glimpse at multimedia is but a tease. Stop the movie.
Stop the music. We'll return to them later.
</p><p>
Moving to the apps folder, the first application I always launch is
FontDemo. First resize whatever font comes up (assuming it's not a
bitmap) and show how you can resize, shear, and rotate the font
interactively. Then click on the "Cycle Fonts" button and show that even
as you cycle through all the fonts in the system you can still adjust the
font attributes and resize the fonts very quickly.
</p><p>
CDPlayer is the next application I launch. First, play different tracks
from a standard audio CD. Next, record some music directly from the audio
CD onto your hard disk: Click on the disk icon and use the track's time
representation and preview button to isolate the portion of the track you
want to record. Point out that the size calculation is computed
dynamically as you adjust the length of the piece you're going to save.
</p><p>
The Mandelbrot application is a good example of what two processors can
do when they work together. Explain that the Mandelbrot calculation is
designed to run in two threads, one for even and one for odd scan lines.
These threads are "assigned" to the two processors automatically by the
OS. I like to make it clear that this assignation isn't permanent; when
it's time for a thread to run, the system runs it on whichever processor
is available.
</p><p>
Once you've recalculated the Mandelbrot set a number of times (by
repeatedly dragging across portions of the window), bring up the Pulse
application. Pulse shows that, indeed, both processors are working
simultaneously; and, by turning off one of the processors (by clicking on
the processor number in Pulse), you can show the performance difference
between a single-processor and a dual-processor machine.
</p><p>
Move to the ImageViewer application. (To show this best you need to be in
32-bit color mode.) The first thing to do is open up a couple of 32-bit
TIFF images from the "images" folder (this is one of the optional items
from the "Be OS" CD-ROM). Make a selection in one image, and drag it into
the other. Drag a selection into a folder window to save the clipping as
a file. Drag the file into another image—the saved clipping is
automatically overlaid on the target image. All of this is made possible
through the BMessage object.
</p><p>
The Flight application is a good demonstration of some simple 3D
rendering in a joystick-controlled game. (I prefer the 8-bit version of
the demo; the 32-bit version looks better, but it isn't as responsive.)
For kicks, try flying with one hand (on the joystick) while dragging and
resizing the game window with the other (using the mouse). Try flying,
resizing, and singing at the same time. Ask your audience to join in.
</p><p>
Another game worth showing off is Innerstrike from Ex Algebra (look for
it in the optional folder on the "Be OS" CD-ROM). You should run through
the game ahead of time to figure out the configuration menus. The
introduction is pretty impressive, with nice sound and 3D graphics. To
get out of the game (at any time), press the Alternate and Escape keys.
This will cycle through a couple of screens and then restore the screen
to its previous state.
</p><p>
Now comes the grand finale. This is the trickiest part of a good Be demo,
but it's also the most impressive. Here's what I suggest:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
After quitting all running applications, open up the apps folder and
start CDPlayer to get some background music going. Then open the
Mailbox and double-click one of the larger movies (Be Logo or
Nefertiti).
</p></li><li><p>
While the movie is loading, open up the apps folder again and launch
FontDemo. Shrink the FontDemo window to about half its original size,
resize the font to be a little larger than the default and click the
Cycle Fonts button. Then minimize the Controls window by
double-clicking its title bar and move the Display window to the lower
left of the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
By this time the movie is probably running—move it to the top
right of the screen. Launch Mandelbrot to show that there are still
some CPU resources left over; iterate through the set a few times.
</p></li><li><p>
Next, open a piece of audio mail from the Mailbox; the mail audio
will automatically mix in with the CD audio.
</p></li><li><p>
Launch a couple more movies and, while you're waiting for them to
come up, bring up the Pulse application to show CPU activity. By now
there will be quite a bit going on, but you can still iterate in the
Mandelbrot window and open up folders in the Browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the other two movies have opened, position them in such a way
that all three movies are visible along with the FontDemo Display
window, Mandelbrot, and a Browser window. You can then explain that
people are seeing three movies, two audio sources, font cycling, and
Mandelbrot calculations, all happening simultaneously.
</p></li><li><p>
You can now throw a couple of other things into the finale to make it
even more impressive, if you have the appropriate hardware. One is the
Midi application. If you have an external MIDI synthesizer you can
throw MIDI into the mix by playing one of the sample MIDI files
included with your BeBox. If you have a network connection, you can use
Orb to show a world-wide web page coming in during the finale as well.
</p></li></ul><p>
That's the basic Be demo. By far the most important thing in giving a
good demo is to have fun. Joe Palmer, our director of hardware
engineering, is a great example of this. Someone once said that "Joe
gives demos with the confidence of someone who's never written software!"
</p><p>
If you have a demo version of your application, let us know. We look
forward to showing off the machine with all of the great third-party
applications that we'll see in the coming months.
</p><p>
(Note: If you're not up to speed on all the Be applications used in this
demo, see "Using the Be Applications," which starts on page 65 of the "Be
User's Guide." This section describes all of the Be applications in
alphabetical order.)
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-24"></a>Be Developer Profile: Communic8, Inc.</h2></div></div></div><p>
Like virtually every Be developer, Robert Currey is excited about the
ground-floor opportunity the BeBox presents. “<span class="quote">Based on what I'd heard and
read, I was excited about the BeBox before I saw one. Then I saw a demo
and—wow! The responsiveness of the machine while a whole mess of
applications was stressing it out really demonstrated its power, and that
made the opportunity that much more compelling.</span>”
</p><p>
Robert launched Communic8, Inc. a few months ago and is gearing up fast
to deliver communications software for the BeBox, as well as for the
Macintosh. Currently a two-person shop in Bellevue, Washington, Robert
and his partner are having a blast working on the BeBox: “<span class="quote">The speed is
great, the clean architecture is refreshing, and the chance to get our
hands dirty on a new hot rod makes us the envy of all our developer
friends...</span>” Robert did his college graduate work in the field of parallel
processing and says, “<span class="quote">The idea of having a parallel machine of my own is
very appealing.</span>”
</p><p>
With the Internet becoming the worldwide communications standard, Robert
is especially excited about BeBox connectivity. “<span class="quote">The BeBox's Internet
connectivity could prove to be a rich source of opportunity for both your
product and mine.</span>”
</p><p>
Robert's first product will be Communic8 Mail, a scriptable e-mail
application that will be able to connect to a number of different
servers. In addition to standard Internet e-mail transmissions, Communic8
Mail will also know how to send and receive messages through America
Online, through a fax, and will even record and send voice mail. Design
work is almost done, and coding will begin soon, which puts product
availability 12 to 18 months down the road.
</p><p>
Following Communic8 Mail, Robert plans to develop a scriptable PIM
(personal information manager) for the BeBox. The PIM program will be
tightly integrated with Communic8 mail; for instance, when a customer's
e-mail address is updated in the PIM, Communic8 Mail will automatically
use the updated e-mail address when sending a message to the customer
from the Communic8 Mail address book.
</p><p>
His hopes for the BeBox? “<span class="quote">I hope every kid in America wants—and gets
—one.</span>”
</p><p>
For more information, send Robert e-mail at Communic8 at

Going to meet developers is always a source of trepidation for us. They
merely hold our future in their hands. At Apple's developers' conference
in San Jose, we were going to meet some of them in person for the first
time, hear what they had to say about Developer Release 7, show the BeBox
to new ones, and schmooze with old friends. At the end of the week we had
learned more and done more than we expected.
</p><p>
The bad news is that each such event reminds us of the size and
complexity of the engineering, support, and marketing task ahead of us.
The good news is that we appear to be on the right track, if we are to
believe developer feedback. Also, an intriguing idea came up in several
of the many informal discussions that make up most of the value of such
conferences. And, to cap the week, the BeBox received FCC Class A
approval: This means we can now sell BeBoxes for commercial use. (Class B
is for consumer devices. That will come a little later, probably in
July.) We can now ship product to professionals almost anywhere, and to
consumers in countries where FCC Class A is acceptable.
</p><p>
At the conference, aside from getting ribbed for the choicest bugs in DR7
(updates available on our ftp and web sites), we got very positive
feedback regarding the advances made in both the API and the UI. In
general, the Be OS is perceived to be easy and fun to program, even by
developers for whom C++ wasn't the first choice, or love at first sight.
I don't quite know yet how to best market ease of programming and
expressive power, and I wouldn't mind getting suggestions, but it seems
we'll have to get good at communicating these features of our product.
This search for an effective, expressive power/productivity/fun message
for Be OS programming has been made even more important by the
availability of the CodeWarrior IDE on the BeBox, our first "tractor app"
(I prefer the kinetics of the traction metaphor to the "killer"
connotations, but I'll bow to usage if necessary.) At our developer
meeting Jon Watte, the Metrowerks Be guru, gave a rousing demonstration
of the combined power of CodeWarrior and the Be OS. He showed a sound
editor he'd written in a couple of days and, on stage, in real time,
created a new plug-in filter. Even after figuring in Jon's masterful
skills and infectious pleasure with his craft, this demonstration makes a
strong case for programming the Be OS. And while we can't ship a Jon
Watte clone with each BeBox, we bundle a version of CodeWarrior on the
"Be OS" CD-ROM. Actually, it's the full product but for one limitation,
it builds executables limited to 64K. 64K is a lot more than we got used
to thinking: The Be OS produces much smaller programs than what we see on
older platforms. For a reference point, most of the Be demo applications
we ship sneak under the 64K limit. Once we've cleaned up the traces of
our most embarrassing programming habits, we'll put the source code for
these applications on our Web site and on the "Be OS" CD-ROM for your
editing and edifying pleasure. And when you're ready for the big time,
$149 will get you the "unlimited" CodeWarrior and (if you buy now) four
updates.
</p><p>
Another issue came up at the conference. Perhaps because of the
concentration of Apple employees and Macintosh developers, one suggestion
kept coming up in conversation. The friendly commentators aren't
satisfied with the statement that we're committed to the PPCP/CHRP
standard and that, as soon as the unified platform materializes, the Be
OS will run on it and Be's hardware will evolve to a compliant
multiprocessor implementation. Why wait, they say. Port the Be OS to a
PowerMac or to a Power Computing Mac clone. Some features such as
multiprocessing and richer I/O will get lost in the process, but you'll
make more friends and more people will get to see the Be OS. The idea is
intriguing, especially coming from friends in the Macintosh community.
They note Apple appeared to sanction a port of Linux, why not the Be OS
on a PowerMac while the PPCP platform gathers esteem? The technical
details require much thought—how to get the information needed to map
ourselves to PowerMac hardware. And, assuming the PowerMac port gets
done, what are the marketing consequences? Meaning, if we can be forgiven
for bringing up such a materialistic issue, how do we best use a PowerMac
port to make our developers and ourselves more successful? An intriguing
suggestion capping an interesting week.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id484803"></a>Be Demo Tour: Be in Europe</h2></div></div></div><p>
Be's European team has been busy. Starting from their base in Paris, Jean
Calmon, Christophe Droulers, and Georges-Edouard Beranger have taken the
BeBox demo on the road. They have been keeping us informed on the
reaction to the road trips, as accounted below:
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id484817"></a>Helsinki, April 12</h3></div></div></div><p>
Osma Ahvenlampi and Janne Kalliola took us on a tour of the HUT (Helsinki
University of Technology) where we were to give the demo. Posters of the
Be presentation could be seen everywhere.
</p><p>
The night before the demo, we went for a "sauna evening," a normal way to
discuss business in Finland. We spent almost two hours talking about the
BeBox, and then decided to have an unplanned demonstration of DR7 just
next to the sauna —we powered up the BeBox right there in the hot
steam. This was the "hottest" part of our tour in Finland: Twelve geeks,
clad only on towels, looking closely at the screen and watching all the
changes. A couple of fellows opened up the box and started poking around,
already planning their modifications.
</p><p>
The next day, over 170 students crammed into a HUT lecture room for the
demo. More than half the audience owned two or more computers —we were
in the right place. A lot of them were part of the Amiga and UNIX/Linux
communities; and almost all were disappointed (to put it politely) with
Windows 95.
</p><p>
After a half-hour slide presentation of Be and the BeBox architecture,
Georges-Edouard gave a 20 minute demo of the box. He was met with smiles
and great applause at the finale. Then we had a Q and A session with good
questions about MPEG, licensing, distribution, pricing, and so on. These
folks were clearly serious about developing applications.
</p><p>
We spent another three hours meeting informally with members of the
audience, and answered tons of questions regarding hardware (604,
parallel processing, <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™, MIDI, and so on) and software (the
kits and media synchronization). After being told that the BeBox had the
Metrowerks IDE built-in, one fellow started to write and compile an
application right there.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id484866"></a>Paris, April 16</h3></div></div></div><p>
After our Finnish trip we returned to France for a presentation at the
EFREI (French High School of Electronics and Computing), where 800
students are working to get their electrical or computing certificate.
The presentation took place in a lecture hall with almost 200 people --
that's a quarter of the school! Again, almost everyone owned a computer,
and most were UNIX/Linux users.
</p><p>
After a short discussion of the Be project, structure, and products,
Georges-Edouard gave an extended demonstration of the BeBox. The audience
jumped to their feet at the end; they loved it! The entire presentation
was planned to take two hours ... we stayed there for nearly five, giving
side demonstrations of the Be IDE, BeBounce, Flight (which they really
appreciated), and everything we could show on DR7.
</p><p>
By the time we got back to our offices, we already had e-mail with praise
for the demo, requests for demos at other universities and high schools
—and some commitments to buy BeBoxes.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id484901"></a>Linkoping, Sweden, May 9</h3></div></div></div><p>
Linkoping is the site of the prestigious Computer Science University in
Sweden. The 4500 students use 200 SparcStations, massive parallel
computers, and even the most powerful Cray Computer in Northern Europe.
(Part of the campus was built during the cold war; the buildings were
designed to be used as hangars if necessary!)
</p><p>
There is a 500-member "geek club" there called Lysator
(http://www.lysator.liu.se/). As in Finland, the Amiga is their ideal.
Daniel Helmers did a great job preparing for our presentation by putting
up yellow posters everywhere in the University, and even created a
special mailbox to welcome and help visitors to the demo.
</p><p>
The demonstration took place in a lecture hall with 190 seats ... more
than 320 people showed up. Again, the demo was met with tremendous
applause. They loved the multiple workspaces with their dynamic
capabilities (moving the BeLogo movie through different depths and
resolutions).
</p><p>
The Q and A session lasted for more than an hour and a half, with
questions about multiple user support, remote login, object request
brokers, and object models to help support other languages. We then spent
another hour talking one-on-one with the students. All the developer
forms disappeared in a matter of seconds.
