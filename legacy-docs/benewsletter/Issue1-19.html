Whether you want to write an entire Web browser or just want to add a
small networking feature to your application, this article is for you.
For purposes of this article, I classify network applications into three
areas:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Applications that follow a standard protocol such as FTP.
</p></li><li><p>
Applications that use their own protocol ("original applications"),
but are designed to work across several operating systems.
</p></li><li><p>
Original applications that only work under a single type of operating
system.
</p></li></ul><p>
For standard protocols, there is undoubtedly some freely available Unix
code that will do the trick for you. A little searching around on the
Internet will find the code you want. It will be socket-based, and will
already be designed and debugged—all you have to do is port it to the
BeBox. And since the API on the BeBox approximates sockets, porting
socket-based code shouldn't be much trouble.
</p><p>
For original applications which you hope to port to other operating
systems, you might need some help. If you aren't already familiar with
sockets, a good place to start is "Unix Network Programming", by W.
Richard Stevens. The most important point to keep in mind when you're
designing your protocol is that different processors represent the C data
types differently. The most common causes of problems are assumptions
about the sizes of the basic types, field alignment within structures,
and the endian-ness of multiple-byte data. There are a number of ways to
deal with these issues:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The simplest method is to convert everything into text before sending
it to the network. Text is, of course, extremely portable, and has the
added advantage of being easy to debug since you can easily see from a
captured data packet exactly what was sent. Text conversion may seem
inefficient, but many fine protocols—including HTTP—use this
technique. Furthermore, if your application is intended to run across
the Internet, the inefficiency won't be noticed since the Internet runs
at a pretty slow speed.
</p></li><li><p>
Beyond that, there are several commercial and free packages that can
make your life easier. One free package, which has already been ported
to several platforms, is the Sun RPC/XDR source code distribution. It
is widely available on CD-ROM and through various FTP sites on the
Internet.
</p></li></ul><p>
Okay, perhaps you are saying, "Standards? We don't need no stinkin'
standards!". You just want to write something that is BeBox specific, and
you really don't want to use text or learn about some stinkin' RPC
package. I have just the thing for you...
</p><p>
I've written a couple of C++ classes (NetServer and NetClient) that send
and receive BMessages over a network. If you're familiar with BMessages,
you should have no problem with these classes.
</p><p>
A NetServer object listens for in-coming requests (BMessages) that are
sent by NetClient objects. When it receives a message, NetServer does
whatever it is that you need it to do, and then sends a response to the
NetClient.
</p><p>
A typical NetServer setup looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> *<code class="varname">request</code>;
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> *<code class="varname">reply</code>;
<code class="classname">NetServer</code> *<code class="varname">server</code>;

<code class="varname">server</code> = new <code class="classname">NetServer</code>(<code class="varname">UDP_port</code>);
for (;;) {
   <code class="varname">server</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ReceiveMessage</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">request</code>);
   <code class="varname">reply</code> = new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>();

   <span class="comment">/* Here's where your application-specific
    * code goes, including the formulation of
    * the reply message.
    */</span>

    <code class="varname">server</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SendReply</code>(<code class="varname">reply</code>);
    delete <code class="varname">request</code>;
    delete <code class="varname">reply</code>;
}
</pre><p>
As shown above, the <code class="classname">NetServer</code> is created in
reference to a <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> port
number (the argument to the constructor). You can use any port in the
range 1 through 65535, but stick to ports above number 1024—lower ports
are reserved for standard protocols like FTP. Also, you should make the
port number configurable if you intend to ship your application. This
way, if it conflicts with another application, the user can select
another port to resolve the conflict.
</p><p>
On the client side, the NetClient configuration looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> <code class="varname">request</code>;
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> *<code class="varname">reply</code>;
<code class="classname">NetClient</code> *<code class="varname">client</code>;

<code class="varname">client</code> = new <code class="classname">NetClient</code>(<code class="varname">serverHostName</code>, <code class="varname">UDP_port</code>);

<span class="comment">/* format your BMessage here */</span>
<code class="varname">client</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SendMessage</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">request</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">reply</code>);
<span class="comment">/* examine the reply */</span>
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">NetClient</code> is served by a <code class="classname">NetServer</code>
that's running on the machine
"serverHostName" and that has the given UDP port number. The
communication between the client and the server is straightforward: The
<code class="classname">NetClient</code> sends its message, the <code class="classname">NetServer</code>
receives it and sends a reply,
the <code class="classname">NetClient</code> receives the reply, and then (possibly) sends another
message, and so on.
</p><p>
Implicit in all this is that these object use the UDP protocol. You may
be aware that UDP has a reputation for losing packets. The
NetServer/<code class="classname">NetClient</code> model protects against lost packets (or, in the model
world, lost messages) through a feature of the <code class="classname">NetClient</code> object: Every
<code class="classname">NetClient</code> has its own timeout threshold and retransmission count. If the
<code class="classname">NetClient</code> doesn't hear from its NetServer by the time its timeout has
expired, it retransmits its message. The object continues to retransmit
at regular intervals until a reply shows up, or until the retransmit
count is exhausted.
</p><p>
Given this scheme, the NetServer must be prepared to receive duplicate
messages. Each message is tagged with a unique transaction ID; the
NetServer can check IDs as they arrive through its <code class="methodname">CurrentTransactionID()</code>
function, and can compare the current ID with a list of the most
recently-received IDs (which you have to maintain yourself). If it's
already seen a particular ID, it should regard the current message as a
duplicate.
</p><p>
I've left out some details here such as error checking for the sake of a
simple discussion. However, the sample code on the FTP server does deal
with errors, as well as some other features of the classes not mentioned
here. You can download it from
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/code/netmessage.

It's a bit like those television ads where adults are embarrassed to
admit they love corn flakes. Home computers users say they buy their
computers to do work, when the truth is, a lot of them are booting up to
play games.
</p><p>
For proof, just consider the recently-released Software Publishers
Association (SPA) data: 1995 entertainment software sales revenues were
up almost 43 percent in North America. And last year, the SPA reported
that a third of the households that used computer games had more than 10
games.
</p><p>
Randy Thompson, a director at Dynamix,Inc., an Oregon-based entertainment
software developer, isn't surprised. Dynamix (a division of Sierra
On-Line) has been producing games for more than 10 years. Their titles
include: Red Baron, The Incredible Machine, Aces Over Europe, EarthSiege,
and Front Page Sports Football. The 130-person company develops for
Windows, Macintosh, PlayStation, and Sega—and now they're considering
adding the BeBox to the list.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The computer industry has become stagnant,</span>” Thompson says. “<span class="quote">If you want
to develop a mass-market product, DOS/Wintel and Macintosh are pretty
much the choices. But neither of these giants can raise the technology
bar. The Amiga injected some life back into the industry, but it was an
ill-fated system.</span>” Thompson sees potential for the BeBox to wake up a
slumbering industry, and to do so with a brighter fate.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The BeBox is an exciting new computer platform, and we want to get in on
the ground floor,</span>” he says. “<span class="quote">Technologically, the BeBox is superior to
all the systems we currently develop for. It's got a clean OS with an
incredibly rich set of standard features: audio, video, and I/O ports.</span>”
</p><p>
Their first BeBox project will be a real-time 3D game using
motion-captured, polygon-based characters. They hope to release the game
internally by the end of the year—at that point, they'll decide whether
to release it publicly. After that, they're planning multi-player games
that can be played over a local area network, or remotely over the
Internet.
</p><p>
Since they're owned by one of the largest publishers in the world,
Dynamix doesn't face the retail shelf-space challenges a small developer
might. Thompson does, however, encourage the “<span class="quote">shelf-space challenged</span>” to
consider the advantages of Be's software distribution model. Games
customers are hungry for the latest software, and electronic distribution
could make a real difference to a small developer's bottom line.
</p><p>
Based on the initial grass-roots interest in the BeBox, Thompson sees
great potential for a “<span class="quote">loyal, if not large, user base.</span>” If their
programmers are any indication, he'll be right. “<span class="quote">Our programmers have
been pushing harder than anyone to get a BeBox in-house. They can't wait
to get their hands on one.</span>”

Last Friday we closed a $14 million financing round with major Silicon
Valley venture firms and earlier supporters of our company. And so we
open a new chapter of Be's life.
</p><p>
The investors:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The round is led by David Marquardt of August Capital. David was an
early (and then only) venture investor in Microsoft, and sits on their
board. He invested in and sat on Sun Microsystems' board in the early
days as well. August Capital is a new fund, started by David last
August (hence the name).
</p></li><li><p>
New Entreprise Associates (NEA) is represented by Mark Perry. NEA is
one of the largest Silicon Valley venture firms with about $700 million
under management.
</p></li><li><p>
Alta Technologies, represented by Garrett Gruener, is based in San
Francisco. This is a newly formed fund led by Jean Deleage, formerly of
Burr Egan and Deleage. Jean and his team's reputation was such that he
raised his $100 million fund in a single presentation to Calpers, the
California state employees retirement fund.
</p></li><li><p>
AVI Management Partners is represented by Barry Weinman. As some of
you know, AVI is a local fund led by Peter Wolken.
</p></li><li><p>
Christian Marchandise represents a group of French investors from a
previous round.
</p></li><li><p>
We also enjoyed renewed support from some of our earliest investors,
such as Newtek Ventures, Innolion, Convergences and Star Ventures, as
well as personal friends of mine.
</p></li><li><p>
I'm also re-investing in this round—it's a great deal.
</p></li></ul><p>
For more details see our press release on www.be.com.
</p><p>
As I wrote above, this is a new chapter. The previous ones have been
challenging, character building, learning experiences—pick your
bromide. Assembling a team and developing the technology, our real
assets, have been the easiest part, at least when compared to fund
raising. I had no experience on that subject when I started the company
and it showed.
</p><p>
When we started in October 1990, right after I left Apple, the idea of
building yet-another-platform wasn't popular in financial circles, to say
the least. NeXT and Momenta were burned in the collective consciousness;
Go/EO were not far from doing it again. So, the company started from my
back pocket and from the checkbooks of people such as Seymour Cray, and
friends from HP and Bull.
</p><p>
In our first round of financing, the venture arm of the largest French
bank, Credit Lyonnais, stepped in as the lead investor. That turned out
to be helpful in the short term, but it became difficult when this lead
investor turned out to a be a large distressed bank, unable to support
the company when AT&amp;T gave up on the Hobbit, the microprocessor used for
our first design (the PowerPC didn't exist when we started). This
happened at the beginning of 1994. We had to scramble to implement a new
PPC-based design, port our software to it and raise more money. AT&amp;T
helped a bit, and Christian Marchandise led a second round in 1995.
</p><p>
Then came the Agenda demo in October 1995; this was the turning point.
Two of our new investors were in the room when our demo got a standing
ovation. The press was generous to us, and developers started to support
our platform.
</p><p>
One night at dinner after Agenda, John Fry remarked we had been very
lucky. As I acquiesced he made two remarks to explain his point. One of
which gave me a retrospective chill: The Web did not exist when we
started. It's the great equalizer, tremendously helpful to a small
company such as ours. It helps our developers market their software and
it is an exciting new application area for Be. We were lucky to introduce
just as the Web was showing its muscle and gaining respect.
</p><p>
More sobering was his remark that we had been lucky to present our
product after Windows 95 shipped. Indeed, had we met our schedule, we
would have demoed at Demo 95—right when Microsoft was showing its $200
million picture of the bride (Win95), if I can be forgiven this remark.
Had we shown our product in February 1995, we would have gotten a
commiserating pat on the back: “<span class="quote">Windows 95 will do everything you claim
to do, and more.</span>” Instead, the market had met the mother-in-law in August
when Windows 95 finally shipped. So, in October we got compared to the
real product. A little luck helps.
</p><p>
Now we have the means to raise this promising child and allow the BeBox
to reach its natural markets at the intersection of the Web, image
processing, digital audio and video. To all the people who supported us,
outside and inside, my heartfelt thanks. Let's move forward and develop
this business.
