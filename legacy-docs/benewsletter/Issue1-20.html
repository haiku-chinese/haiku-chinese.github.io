One of the most welcome advances in application design over the last few
years is the introduction of "plug-in" modules. Plug-ins are external
pieces of code that you can load into your application, thereby extending
the utility and intelligence of your app. This style of design, made
popular by applications such as Photoshop, has many advantages:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
"Plugged-into" applications are smaller and easier to write.
</p></li><li><p>
Plug-ins can be provided by third parties that specialize in specific
algorithms or techniques.
</p></li><li><p>
End-users don't have to wait for the next release to "upgrade" the
applications that they own.
</p></li></ul><p>
On the BeBox, plug-ins are called "add-ons". As an application writer,
you define a set of functions that you want add-on modules to provide.
Your app can then load any module that provides those functions.
</p><p>
As an example, consider a video application that wants to let the user
apply a "wipe" between two video sources. But the application itself
doesn't provide any wiping routines—instead, it loads an add-on that
provides a wipe function, and then finds and calls that function.
</p><p>
To do this, the application and the add-on have to agree on a protocol
for the function. As a graphical routine, wiping is a well-defined
problem in which two input frames are processed to produce a third. The
protocol of the <code class="function">wipe_frame()</code> function, below, embodies the parameters of
the process: It accepts the input frames as (fictitious) <code class="classname">VideoFrame</code>
object arguments, and returns the processed frame as a third <code class="classname">VideoFrame</code>.
The function also takes a <span class="type">float</span> argument that specifies where we are in
the wipe, given as a percentage of the total process:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="type"><code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *</span><code class="varname">wipe_frame</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *</span><code class="varname">input_a</code>,
                       <span class="type"><code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *</span><code class="varname">input_b</code>,
                       <span class="type">float</span> <code class="varname">percent</code>);
</pre><p>
Any add-on that provides such a frame-wiping function can be loaded into
and used by the video application.
</p><p>
What does the code look like on the application side? First, we set a
<code class="classname">BFile</code> to represent the add-on, and load the file through the Kernel Kit's
<code class="function">load_add_on()</code> function:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="classname">BFile</code>      <code class="varname">add_on_file</code>;
<span class="type">image_id</span>   <code class="varname">add_on_image</code>;

<span class="comment">/* We'll assume that a_ref is a valid record_ref
 * that refers to the add-on file.
 */</span>
<code class="varname">add_on_file</code>.<code class="methodname">SetRef</code>(<code class="varname">a_ref</code>);

<code class="varname">add_on_image</code> = <code class="function">load_add_on</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">add_on_file</code>);
if (<code class="varname">add_on_image</code> &lt; <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>) {
    <span class="comment">/* error */</span>
    ...
}
</pre><p>
In the example, <code class="varname">add_on_image</code> is an <span class="type">image_id</span> value that identifies the
add-on that was loaded. All further references to the add-on are based on
this, the add-on's "image ID" number.
</p><p>
Now we need to get a handle on the add-on's <code class="function">wipe_frame()</code> function. To do
this, we declare a function pointer variable (<code class="varname">add_on_wipe</code>), and point it
at <code class="function">wipe_frame()</code> through the Kit's <code class="function">get_image_symbol()</code> function:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="comment">/* Declare the variable ...*/</span>
<span class="type">int</span> (*<code class="varname">add_on_wipe</code>)(<code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *<code class="parameter">input_a</code>,
                   <code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *<code class="parameter">input_b</code>,
                   <span class="type">float</span> <code class="parameter">percent</code>);

<span class="comment">/* and set its value. */</span>
if (<code class="function">get_image_symbol</code>(<code class="varname">add_on_image</code>,
                        "wipe_frame__FP5VideoFrameP5VideoFrame",
                        <code class="constant">B_SYMBOL_TYPE_TEXT</code>,
                        &amp;<code class="varname">add_on_wipe</code>) &lt; <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>)
{
      <span class="comment">/* Error; unload the add-on (at least). */</span>
      <code class="function">unload_add_on</code>(<code class="varname">add_on_image</code>);
      ...
}
</pre><p>
The <code class="function">get_image_symbol()</code> function is, admittedly, a bit cryptic. In
particular, the second argument needs some explanation: The C++ compiler
mangles a function's name to encode the function's protocol. When you ask
an add-on for a particular function, you identify the function by its
compiler-mangled name. See the Kernel Kit chapter of The Be Book for more
information on name-mangling and the <code class="function">get_image_symbol()</code> function.
</p><p>
Getting back on track, we now have a variable, <code class="varname">add_on_wipe</code>, that points
to the add-on's <code class="function">wipe_frame()</code> function. We can now call the
dynamically-loaded code with this short snippet:
float percent;
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="classname">VideoFrame</code> *<code class="varname">frame_a</code>, *<code class="varname">frame_b</code>, *<code class="varname">wiped_frame</code>;

<span class="comment">/* You would undoubtedly set up a loop to get
 * successive pairs of frames from the VideoFrame
 * sources, to do something with the processed frame,
 * and to bump the percent value.
 */</span>
while (...) {
      ...
      <code class="varname">wiped_frame</code> = <code class="function">add_on_wipe</code>(<code class="varname">frame_a</code>, <code class="varname">frame_b</code>, <code class="varname">percent</code>);
      ...
   }
</pre><p>
At each pass through the loop, <code class="varname">wiped_frame</code> points to the next stage of
the wipe. Our video application doesn't need to know how the <code class="function">wipe_frame()</code>
function works, it merely manages the input and output data, and provides
a framework for the add-on to operate in.
</p><p>
One can imagine useful modules for other types of applications. For
example, a spread sheet could recognize add-ons that calculate a result
based on the input from a range of cells. A MIDI app might use add-ons to
provide patch editors for various types of synthesizers. A paint program
could use add-ons for different "brushes", a sound editor could use them
to store different filters. The same add-on-loading technique is used in
all these instances.
</p><p>
Now let's consider a more complicated example. Suppose we want to write a
library that will load (graphic) images that are stored in various
formats—GIF, JPEG, TIFF, and so on. Furthermore, we want our library
to be able to load graphics that are stored in formats that aren't
defined yet—we don't want the introduction of new formats to make our
library (and the applications built from it) obsolete. Not only do we not
want to re-write the library's code, we don't even want to recompile.
</p><p>
To implement this ideal, we have to add a couple of rules: Our shared
library must present an immutable API that applications can depend on,
and the add-on modules (files) must be kept in a place that the library
knows about.
</p><p>
As a simple example of this model, let's say our graphic-loading library
provides a single function, <code class="function">LoadGraphic</code>(record_ref ref). The interface
between the library and the add-on is a function that's also called
<code class="function">LoadGraphic()</code>. When the application calls <code class="function">LoadGraphic()</code>, the library
decides which add-on to use (it could do this by looking at the file type
or filename extension of the argument ref, or by loading add-ons one by
one until it finds a winner), and then it passes the ref to the add-on's
<code class="function">LoadGraphic()</code> function.
</p><p>
This method of operation completely decouples the shared library from any
specific knowledge about the various graphic formats. A user can
"educate" his or her system simply by installing a new or improved
add-on: All applications using the shared library will immediately
benefit from the new code. This enriches the user's environment, and
creates a new market for third parties.
</p><p>
In summary, add-ons provide a way to make an application extensible, for
the good of developers and users:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
This extensibility reduces the effort that's needed to produce or
improve an application, and lets developers provide upgrades to their
applications between releases.
</p></li><li><p>
Third-party add-on developers can focus on particular algorithms or
techniques without having to develop entire applications.
</p></li><li><p>
To the user, extensibility means you can add features without having
to buy an entirely new application.
</p></li></ul><p>
Without a doubt, add-ons are cool.

The prospect of developing applications on a new platform is always
delightful. Everything is allowed, everything CAN be created again, from
scratch, and you're THE creator: The empty page is in front of you.
</p><p>
Then comes the first step...and the first problem: Everything HAS TO be
created again, from scratch. Once again you have to spend time and energy
designing buttons, positioning text and pictures, loading menus,
intercepting and interpreting mouse-clicks. All this dirty work, when
your target is to create THE ultimate pea-sorting algorithm (I'm not
allowed here to deal with apples), or THE view object that will create
drawings that rival Picasso's—whatever part of software you like.
</p><p>
When my company, Lorienne [Now BeatWare], began to use the BeBox, we
found many features we were waiting for: a good multitasking,
multithreaded OS, a fast window system, an innovative approach to the
file system—all these features on the same computer. But still, there
was that old black hole into which time disappears when you don't have a
good application modeling tool. Rather than throw up our hands and mutter
"tant pis" with a dismissively Gallic sniff, we decided to inch up to the
abyss and peek in.
</p><p>
First of all, we tried to determine the requirements of a "sufficient"
app modeling solution. We agreed on these specifications:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A good application modeler must have a graphical interface design
tool that can be used interactively.
</p></li><li><p>
Developers must be able to add their own C++ objects, either as
interface elements, or simply as objects that their applications create.
</p></li><li><p>
There must be a means for connecting interface items (controls) with
the member functions of the objects that have been added.
</p></li><li><p>
The application's variables—especially object pointers—must be
accessible for initialization.
</p></li><li><p>
Most important, the modeler must be able to view an application as a
project—it must be useful throughout the development of an app, and
not just applied as a one-shot filter that doesn't do much more than
create source and headers files that then must be edited by hand.
</p></li></ul><p>
Voila, voila, as we say in France. With such a tool, our problems
disappear. But...who's going to write it?
</p><p>
Many times, I thought the solution was on my desk: the new <span class="trademark">Super++Tool</span>™
. But there was something missing: either it was impossible to add my
own objects into the framework, or I had to use a different language than
the one I was developing with. Super++Tool gets better with each release,
but we needed to go in a slightly different direction.
</p><p>
So we decided to write it ourselves.
</p><p>
The toughest part of a C++ application modeling tool is the language
itself. Unlike other object-oriented languages, such as Objective C or
Pascal Object, C++ doesn't know how to instantiate objects from classes
that are added dynamically. To create custom objects, the tool has to
generate, compile, and link a piece of source code. Generating source
code is dangerous—programmers will want modify that code, and so our
fifth requirement is threatened. But we found no way to escape this, so
we did our best: We designed the program to generate as little code as
possible.
</p><p>
The Application Modeler (as it's currently called) is running on selected
BeBoxes around the world. Soon it will be shipped with every machine. The
app isn't thoroughly polished—we plan to modify some features,
especially for the user interface—but, still, you can create an
interface, add and manipulate your own objects, and many other things.
</p><p>
We at Lorienne [Now BeatWare] are, of course, the first users of this
tool. We're using it now to develop other applications: a word processor,
drawing and paint programs, a spread sheet—but we'll leave these for
another article.

“<span class="quote">UNIX just isn't my idea of a lot of fun,</span>” says Willy Langeveld, a Ph.D.
physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (a government-funded
scientific research institution) in Palo Alto, California.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I work mostly on UNIX systems by day,</span>” Willy says. “<span class="quote">So I decided that in
my free time, I wanted to enjoy myself.</span>” That's why he's developing for
the BeBox. “<span class="quote">When I heard about the BeBox, it felt just like 10 years ago
with the Amiga—it sounded like it would be fun!</span>”
</p><p>
Willy is no software rookie. While he formally established his company,
Verified Logic, just this year, he's been developing for the Amiga for
many years. His products include the terminal emulator VLT, the REXX
support libraries rexxarplib and rexxmathlib, and the XPR (external file
transfer protocol) standard. He also worked with Tom Rokicki of Radical
Eye Software on a port of Maplesoft's Maple V release 3 to the Amiga.
</p><p>
Aside from fun, what Willy likes best about the BeBox is its fast,
powerful multi-processor design. “<span class="quote">It's faster than any Amiga.</span>” And as for
the BeOS? “<span class="quote">I think it could easily eclipse AmigaDOS within a year.</span>”
</p><p>
Currently, Willy is working on "rfs", a client/server protocol that
mounts the BeBox file system on an Amiga. “<span class="quote">One might ask what use this
will be once the BeBox acquires an NFS server—the answer is that rfs
isn't a BeBox-only program. The file server isn't platform specific, it
will run on just about anything. And anyone could write a client part to
use with something other than an Amiga.</span>” He expects rfs to be available
this summer.
</p><p>
Langeveld's BeBox plans include the possibility of a port of Maple V.
Also, many people have asked him to port VLT to the BeBox.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">My hopes are that the BeBox will become the next Amiga. After that, it
will take over the world,</span>” says Langeveld. Of course, being a scientist,
he admits, “<span class="quote">I'm too much of a realist to believe that both of these hopes
will be realized. But I really think the first one might happen!</span>”
</p><p>
In the meantime, we're happy to report that Langeveld is accomplishing
his goals: “<span class="quote">It's fun! Really fun! That's all I want right now.</span>”
</p><p>

As always, there is food for thought in comp.sys.be, the Internet
newsgroup dedicated to the BeBox and the Be OS. Usenet newsgroups are not
known for meekness and ours is no exception.
</p><p>
Recent threads suggest that we have made confusing gestures and
statements about the company's goals and the vehicles that we think will
get us there. They're good questions: Are we in the hardware business or
the licensing business? In the PC or the workstation market? (The short
answers: Yes, yes, yes, and no).
</p><p>
The confusion is understandable, and we acknowledge our part in prompting
it. After all, we seem to want to do everything: we sell hardware but
we'll also license the Be OS; the OS is new, but it also supports Posix.
This raises more questions, some of which have been posed on the
newsgroup: Why not just go Unix all the way (or NeXTStep, or OpenStep)?
Why not port the Be OS to Mac hardware (and sell CD-ROMs to Mac users
while they wait for Copland)?
</p><p>
To complicate matters, our slogans
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Amiga 96</span>”
“<span class="quote">The Samuel Adams of the PC business</span>”
“<span class="quote">The muscles of a workstation, and the price of a PC</span>”
</p><p>
are a bit, shall we say, "omnidirectional." How could we be surprised by
the confusion?
</p><p>
Let's deal with the Unix/Posix/workstation question first. A premise of
our work is that we address the structural limitations of aging PC
operating systems: The gods have to support an installed base, and that
has made them brittle and rigid. We, on the other hand, can afford to be
flexible—but we have no applications. So we shift the focus to the
positive: We have higher throughput, a simpler programming model, an
easier integration of new technology. These are tools for cutting-edge
Web and digital media applications built by power-hungry, tinkering users
(a.k.a. geeks). A Posix layer—purchased at an affordable amount of
effort on our part—seemed a natural fit. It would help our customers
by bringing in hundreds of public domain programs and utilities...But
that doesn't make the BeBox a workstation.
</p><p>
Furthermore, my own observation of computer hardware and software is that
they don't scale down very well. Once you've set out a design, it's much
easier to add to it than to make a "lite" version. There is no
Windows-lite or Unix Junior, and entry-level workstation hardware doesn't
sell. Mindful of the scaling problem, we didn't want to start as a
workstation with nowhere to go but bigger and unthinkably expensive.
Instead, we set out to produce the least expensive multi-processor
hardware we could, settling for the unloved 603.
</p><p>
(Why unloved? Because Motorola kept telling us the 603 “<span class="quote">couldn't do</span>”
multi-processing. And because the small cache causes poor performance
with the 68K emulator/crutch that the PowerMac needs to prop up old
applications. Frankly, people who see the BeBox in action can't believe
the performance we get out of a "low-end" chip. But it's not just
hardware that does it--it's fresh, baggage-free software. And soon, we
will scale up and the Be OS will really shine. Joe Palmer has us drooling
over his 604-based designs.)
</p><p>
With regard to licensing and hardware: We offer the Be OS for licensing
while we also sell it bundled with our quasi-PPCP hardware. I dealt in a
prior newsletter with the PPCP opportunity: We can't make PPCP happen all
by ourselves. If it becomes the PC/AT of the PowerPC business, our
hardware will be PPCP compatible and we'll sell CD-ROMs with the BeOS to
run on PPCP machines made by Apple and others.
</p><p>
In any event, there is a strong historic reason to offer OS licenses
right from the start: If you don't do it from the very beginning, it's
next to impossible to do it later. Let's try a thought experiment --
purely fictitious, of course:
</p><p>
The scene is Apple's boardroom, 1986. Apple is making $1,000 gross margin
on every Macintosh they sell. Everyone in the room agrees that the Mac OS
should be offered for licensing. But an OS license goes for $100 or less.
Shifting the business to licensing means disturbing the smooth graph of
ever-increasing earnings that was promised as a sacred trust to Wall
Street. So how smart would it be for the CEO and the CFO to face share
holders and say:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Sure, we'll take a steep earnings dive for about three years. But after
that, we'll re-emerge with a new business model and even greater
shareholder value. Trust us.</span>”
</p><p>
(Of course, once the earnings were lowered by other factors, Apple's
transition became easier--but a couple of CEOs and CFOs had come and gone
in the meantime.)
</p><p>
By offering licenses from the very beginning, and sticking with a lean
business model, we intend to make the hardware vs. software question a
moot one. The most important thing we do is system software. We make
hardware because of a chicken-and-egg situation in the PC business: There
were no multi-processor personal computers because there was no MP OS,
and there was no MP OS because no one made PC-priced MP hardware.
</p><p>
So, we apologize for the confusion. But with time—and success --
confusion transmutes into the more approachable "complexity"; more
success and complexity becomes "richness". Look at Microsoft—no one
seems to be confused by their being in the OS and the application
businesses...and hardware...and servers..and browsers...
</p><p>
Of course, I can't wait to find out where we'll be five years from today.
In the meantime we need to continue evangelizing, supporting developers,
