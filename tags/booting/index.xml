While Haiku&amp;rsquo;s UEFI bootloader is at an early stage, it can be leveraged to boot a stable system.
Installing UEFI to disk Haiku can be installed to a system with an UEFI bootloader, however it is a manual process as of R1/beta3. If you boot the anyboot media from UEFI (and install as usual) your system will boot via the legacy BIOS loader.</description></item><item><title>Network Booting Haiku</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/network_booting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2017 22:50:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/network_booting/</guid><description>The root Haiku disk image (raw variant) can be booted remotely over the local network as of recent versions. This is especially useful when an architectures boot and kernel issues need to be troubleshot.
In the example below we will cover remote booting Haiku on various architectures. At the moment this is mostly geared toward developers.
Requirements:
Haiku source code and build environment Linux build tools Enough memory on the test system.</description></item><item><title>TeX Live and LyX; Changes to the boot code</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/jessicah/2015-06-06_tex_live_and_lyx_changes_boot_code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 06:15:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/jessicah/2015-06-06_tex_live_and_lyx_changes_boot_code/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As of &lt;a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?id=0459d90" title="hrev49248">hrev49248&lt;/a>, TeX Live 2014 and LyX 2.1.3 have been added to the Haiku Ports repository!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A word of warning: TeX Live is a mammoth 823MB package, and LyX, whilst not massive, is another 20MB or so. These will undoubtedly take some time to download for installation. Also, upon first launch of LyX, it will appear to not open any windows. This is normal, as LyX is generating a whole bunch of data it needs, which will be stored at ~/config/settings/lyx. Subsequent launches of LyX should be fairly quick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Booting Haiku</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/booting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2010 22:50:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/booting/</guid><description>There are a wide range of options and configurations available to boot Haiku, from from modifying the boot sector, to configuring (and possibly installing) a boot manager.

&lt;p>This article is intended to explain in a nutshell how booting works in general, what the Haiku counterparts of standard boot process elements are and how to get everything together for a working boot in case this is not done automatically. These are things you will encounter installing/booting most operating systems, so it's not entirely Haiku specific.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
