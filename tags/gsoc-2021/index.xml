I started with the input preferences directory and started solving the issues according to haiku guidelines.
A few changes have been made to clang-format. This work takes a lot of time because it needs a complete understanding of how the llvm code works. As there was number of files, it was difficult to figure out which file should contain the solution of the problem but PulkoMandy really helps me alot.</description></item></channel></rss>
