The inventors of RISC-V created a company called HiFive and that company recently released a desktop-class System on a Chip (SoC) board called HiFive Unmatched. Long before this release Haiku developer Alexander von Gluck (kallisti5) had pre-ordered this board and had begun work on the Haiku port to RISC-V, making some progress on the boot loader, u-boot support and memory mapping.</description></item><item><title>Miracles do happen; Development contract for April!</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-03-31_miracles_do_happen_development_contract_april/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 20:40:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-03-31_miracles_do_happen_development_contract_april/</guid><description>Wow. Thanks to our donors' generousity, Adrien is able to continue for a seventh month of improving WebPositive, WebKit and its related techologies. $2145 has been raised this past month! This is spot on with the number mentioned in last month's contract announcement article. If you did not hear, Adrien has started working on HTML5 Audio/Video support, specifically the audio portion. As usual, he is publishing weekly progress reports on his blog.</description></item><item><title>Funded development continues into March!</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-02-28_funded_development_continues_march/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 04:20:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-02-28_funded_development_continues_march/</guid><description>&lt;p>Within these past 4 weeks, over $1,200 USD and &amp;EUR;900 EUR have been raised! Thanks directly to this fundraising, Adrien is now able to be funded through the month of March. With the addition of the newest monthly subscribers, we reached a milestone and now raise over $1,000 per month through recurring monthly donations!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contract extension and 2013 financial review.</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-02-06_contract_extension_and_2013_financial_review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2014 03:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2014-02-06_contract_extension_and_2013_financial_review/</guid><description>&lt;p>
Pawel's contract has concluded with his work being merged into Haiku's master repository. Hopefully within the next few days, he will be able to post another blog post to summarize the improvements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Now the even better news -- the recent donations from everyone has made it possible for Adrien to continue for another month! If another $1200 USD is raised by the end of this month, then there will definitely be enough funds to keep him coding through March (At the moment, our reserves would drop to below $800 USD, which is something we try to avoid.)

&lt;p>
This may be the final chapter of contract extensions, as the available funds will be plummeting to less than $1500 USD.

&lt;p>
This is excellent news.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
As mentioned in the last contract announcement article, the available funding of Haiku, Inc. was starting to dry up.
It had gotten so low, that Adrien and Paweł were told not to expect a third month of contractual development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
However ... &lt;strong>Google has contacted the project and informed us of a $5,000 USD donation!&lt;/strong>
The donation is being processed and should be deposited in the next few weeks.
To simply say "Thank you." is not enough to express the depth of our gratitude.
Instead, many agree that actions speak louder than words.
This donation will immediately be used to finance Adrien and Paweł's contracts for an additional month.
There are few, if any, better uses for this money than to provide two previous Google Summer of Code students the opportunity to flip bits, not burgers.
... and by the way, Thank you Google! :-D

&lt;p>
If there was ever an example of the saying "Money talks and ...", this is it.
Since publishing the "HAIKU needs you!" article in late August, over $5,000 has been raised!
This is from 110 individuals who made a combined 75 recurring monthly donations and 72 one-time donations.
The yearly total is soaring over $20,000 with the help of 322 donors making 354 recurring and 322 one-time donations.
&lt;strong>Because of their efforts and generosity, we are able to finance another month of contractual development for both Adrien and Pawel!&lt;/strong>
Thank you and congratulations to everyone who helped!
&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HAIKU needs you!</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2013-08-29_haiku_needs_you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 00:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2013-08-29_haiku_needs_you/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have heard you. Other areas of Haiku need some loving. Though, we need your contribution to make this awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First and foremost, the package management contracts are going well and are starting to wind down. Ingo is expected to finish his last month within the next week. Oliver will have another 160 hours (spread over two months). As for actual progress, as seen in Ingo&amp;rsquo;s recent blog post, it has been amazing. Hybrids are working (even ground work is done for future possible x86_64 + x86-gcc4 + x86-gcc2 combinations!). Building and updating Haiku for new platforms (e.g., various ARM platforms) is easier for developers. The tool for building ported software, haikuporter, is much more versatile, functional and reduces complexities for porters. They have requested wide spread testing of the &lt;a href="http://www.haiku-files.org/unsupported-builds/package-management-preview">HaikuPM images&lt;/a>, in anticipation of merging the changes back into master branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On to current news &amp;ndash; two developers, Adrien &amp;ldquo;PulkoMandy&amp;rdquo; Destugues and Pawel &amp;ldquo;pdziepak&amp;rdquo; Dziepak wish to have the opportunity to dedicate full-time hours improving different aspects of Haiku. Adrien plans to work on our port of WebKit and our native browser, Webpositive. His first task will be to bring the Services Kit to maturation, which was a former Google Summer of Code project. Pawel desires to enhance CPU scheduler, with respect to utilizing caches better, performance on HyperThread enabled processors and power-savvy (as in wattage consumption) features. As of now, there are only enough funds to provide each developer with a single month of contractual development!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Haikuware Needs Your Help</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/umccullough/2013-07-17_haikuware_needs_your_help/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 04:51:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/umccullough/2013-07-17_haikuware_needs_your_help/</guid><description>&lt;img src="http://haikuware.com/images/stories/logo6.png" border="8" align="right"/>

&lt;img src="../../files/todo-donate.png" border="8" align="right" />
&lt;p>
We are excited to finally share this news about development contracts!
We are going to be funding a minimum 800 hours of HAIKU development and with your help, many more hours!
And to help you preview the progress, there is a set of &lt;a href="http://www.haiku-files.org/unsupported-builds/package-management-preview">pre-built package management images&lt;/a> available!
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
As you know, Ingo and Oliver have been working these past months on Haiku's package management for extremely low rates -- to the tune of &amp;euro;12.50 per hour.
It is a commendable and fortunate event to have developers who are able to devote large blocks of time in their schedules for such a meager pay scale.
This time, we are going to try new models for each of them, in order to secure even more dedicated development time.

&lt;p>
The allure of crowdsourcing is appealing. Notions of being able to
reach out to countless new people, who may become interested in HAIKU
and what it represents have and continue to captivate my attention. Over
the past month, we at Haiku, Inc. have researched, discussed, and
discussed some more, two crowdsourcing alternatives --

and &lt;a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo&lt;/a>.

&lt;strong>Google, Inc. has donated Five-Thousand Dollars to Haiku, Inc.&lt;/strong>
Earlier in December, a Google employee contacted the project to coordinate
their donation. The transaction was received this month and shows as part
of 2013's fundraising progress. This donation will greatly assist in securing
additional development time specifically for HAIKU!
Thank you Google, Inc!

To the left and to the right, commits towering to the sky.
It&amp;rsquo;s outta sight in the dead of night
Here he is, again in this project, with a fistful of keystrokes
And baby, you better believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s back, back in the Haiku groove!
He&amp;rsquo;s back, back in the Haiku groove!

First as a reminder to everyone, as Michael &lt;a href="../../blog/mmlr/2011-11-28_bugs_back_wireless_and_friends">explained&lt;/a> the KeyStore API will be able to &amp;ldquo;securely manage keys, passwords, certificates, etc. in a central place and generic way (so that it can be used by other applications as well)&amp;quot;.

&lt;img src="../../files/WebPositive.png" border="8" align="right" />
&lt;p>
Announcing development contracts is one of the best feelings.
It is a time when a volunteer developer is given the opportunity
to dedicate a large block of time for their hobby -- developing HAIKU!
This is made possible through the countless donations from people like you,
who love Haiku and are willing to give what is right for them, to make Haiku a better
operating system. Thank you to all of
&lt;a href="http://www.haiku-inc.org/public-sponsors.html">our supporters, both public and anonymous&lt;/a>!
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This time, we are pleased to announce that &lt;strong>Alexandre Deckner will be working
on the WebKit port and, if time allows, WebPositive&lt;/strong>. You may remember "aldeck"
primarily from his work on Tracker -- squashing bugs, rewriting sections for better
performance and updating it to &lt;a href="https://github.com/aldeck/haiku/tree/tracker_layout">utilize the Layout API&lt;/a>.
As Alexandre states, &lt;i>
"Good web support is something crucial for any operating system these days,
it is for some users the main software they will use on a computer and one
of the first things a new user will try on Haiku. To summarize, Haiku has
to provide the best web experience possible and i believe i can help to go
in that direction."&lt;/i>

&lt;p>
To be honest, this article is something I have been dreading.
It's one of those situations, where you hope and pray that it gets better before you take action, but it hasn't.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Michael has landed onto some tough times.
The injury from some weeks ago has healed well enough.
However, RealLife&amp;trade; has prevented him from focusing on Haiku.
It involves his personal life outside of Haiku. That's all we know and that's all we need to know.
With everything that has happened and will continue to play out over the next weeks, Michael has decided to cease the contract.
In the future, he does plan to contribute to Haiku.
For now though, he needs to take a step back.

&lt;img src="../../files/haiku-inc.png" border="8" align="left" />
&lt;p>
2011 has been an amazing year for Haiku in many ways. It is easy to
see the improvements in Haiku (the operating system) by looking at
the nightly builds or the bug tracker. In quite such a tangible way.
&lt;a href="http://www.haiku-inc.org">Haiku, Inc.&lt;/a> serves as the business arm of the project, if you will,
collecting donations, handling paperwork, dealing with web hosting,
etc. It is a little harder to see some of the improvements in
Haiku, Inc. sometimes - they are a little more "behind the scenes",
so we wanted to take this time to talk about all of the good stuff
that has happened!

&lt;p>
Haiku, Inc. is ecstatic to announce
&lt;b>Michael Lotz (AKA "mmlr") on a 6 month contract&lt;/b> developing Haiku!!
There is the intention to renew this contract for another 6 months,
making Michael to be the first person to be paid to work on Haiku for an
entire year and you can make that a reality!
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The goal of his contract would be to work on anything and everything
to bring Haiku closer to its first production quality release, better known
as "R1". The scope, variety and quality of code that Michael has produced
over the past six years and even more recently, gives Haiku, Inc. the fullest
confidence in his ability to succeed in every task that he works on.
&lt;b>Simply put, Michael gets the job done and done right.&lt;/b>

&lt;p>
Over the next few weeks, I'll be trying to document some tangible non-C/C++ tasks.
They'll usually be things that I've wanted to do or have been meaning to do, but
for whatever reason haven't gotten around to doing them.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
For each task, there'll a description of what it is,
how it helps the project, and hopefully some information to help you get started.

We are excited to tell you about another proposal for contract development!
This time, it is from &lt;strong>Axel Dörfler. He is proposing to work 120 hours at $14
per hour, for a total of $1,680.&lt;/strong> To remind you of the sheer awesomeness of this,
Axel has been with the Project since nearly the beginning -- he joined a few
months after it was started in 2001. Axel was also
&lt;a href="../../blog/axeld/2005-10-13/haikus_first_employee">Haiku's first employee back&lt;/a>
in 2005! This is a chance to get him back in the saddle -- or, according to some jokes,
back in the basement -- coding Haiku full time for a few weeks.
&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-info">
&lt;strong>Astonishing Update:&lt;/strong> In a mere &lt;strike>24 hours, over $800&lt;/strike> &lt;strike>36 hours, over $1,100&lt;/strike> &lt;strong>42hours, over $3,000&lt;/strong> has been donated! Your response has been overwhelmingly amazing. Thank you for all of your support!

In the two weeks since our announcement to hire developers for specific projects, donations have picked up significantly. Since then we received over $1,600USD and a few more people opting for small but recurrent monthly funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our thanks go out to all contributors!

&lt;p>It's been one week since we kicked off the &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008">Haiku Code Drive 2008&lt;/a> program, and the response so far has been absolutely awesome: in just seven days the community has contributed more than US$5,000 to fund the program, and the donations keep coming in! This is happening thanks to the generosity of the community, and now you have the opportunity to influence where you want the funds that you donated to go:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>&lt;a href="../../poll/2008-08-22/haiku_code_drive_2008_poll">Haiku Code Drive 2008 Poll&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> has started and will run until May 29, 11:59 (US PST), so go cast your vote now! You will need to login, so if you don't have an account with the Haiku website, this is a good time to &lt;a href="../../user/register">create one from here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Haiku Code Drive: May 16 update</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/koki/2008-05-16_haiku_code_drive_may_16_update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2008 22:12:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/koki/2008-05-16_haiku_code_drive_may_16_update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>It's been approximately 24 hours since we started the &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008">Haiku Code Drive 2008&lt;/a>, so I thought I would give a quick update on where we stand right now, and also take the opportunity to share with you a few observations based on some of the feedback that we have received so far. I want to start by saying that the response so far from the community has been great. We are exploring somewhat unknown waters with the Haiku Code Drive, so there was a degree of uncertainty as to how the community would respond. This is why it is so rewarding to see the great outpour of generous donations that we have already received in just one day. Contributions are coming in from all over, including Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, the US and many other countries. We have started a &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008/donate#donors">list of donors&lt;/a> in the donation page, so check it out (to be updated daily).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am keeping an eye on the contributions, and as I write this I can see we are already at about half of what we need to sponsor one student; we are currently at approximately $1,300.00, but the total changes so fast, that it is hard to keep up! This is absolutely awesome, but it's only the beginning. Remember, this is your program: you fund it, you choose who to sponsor. If you have not yet made your pledge to the cause, please &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008/donate">head over to the donation page&lt;/a> and show us your love for Haiku. This is your opportunity to make a difference, so don't miss it! :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call to Arms: Haiku Code Drive 2008</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2008-04-28_call_to_arms_haiku_code_drive_2008/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 19:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2008-04-28_call_to_arms_haiku_code_drive_2008/</guid><description>

This was tough: many good applications had to be left out, and we really hate leaving people out, particularly those who had shown an interest in Haiku. So we started entertaining the idea of sponsoring a few of these students ourselves. Today we introduce you to the Haiku Code Drive 2008, a program designed to raise funds from the community in order to sponsor students to produce code for Haiku. This is how it's going to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We contacted all the GSoC students that applied for Haiku but did not make it, and asked them if they were interested in carrying out their proposed project for a $2,500 stipend each. From their response, we have created this &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008/applications">list of students and their projects&lt;/a>; these are the candidates for the Haiku Code Drive 2008 program. Now we are asking you, the Haiku community, to fund the program by making donations. We will then hold a public poll so that the community can influence which candidates/projects they want to sponsor. At the end of the poll/donation period, we will determine how many and which of the students will be sponsored based on the donated funds and the results of the poll. Check out all the &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008#calendar">details of the program&lt;/a> here, including a &lt;a href="../../community/haiku-code-drive-2008#calendar">timeline with tentative dates&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HaikuBounties.org donations to Haiku</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2006-08-26_haikubounties_org_donations_to_haiku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2006 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2006-08-26_haikubounties_org_donations_to_haiku/</guid><description>We owe a long due recognition to a Haiku contributor who came up with some great ideas, implemented them, and turned them into much needed funding for our project. We are referring to Karl vom Dorff, creator of HaikuBounties.org, a website where contributors can make monetary donations for specific areas of development, and developers can take coding challenges in exchange for the donated bounties. Karl started HaikuBounties.org early this year, and through the course of just a few months, he was able to raise close to $2000!</description></item></channel></rss>
