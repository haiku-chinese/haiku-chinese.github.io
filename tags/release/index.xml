The updated timeline is here.
The Beta3 release introduces an important update to Haiku WebKit, which subsequently produces some rendering regressions.
While several of the bugs have already been fixed in Haiku WebKit this week, one final bug remains, which involves an issue with disappearing text.</description></item><item><title>Haiku R1/Beta3 Timeline Approved</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-06-14_haiku_r1beta3_timeline_approved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:45:15 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-06-14_haiku_r1beta3_timeline_approved/</guid><description>The release timeline for Haiku R1/Beta 3 has been approved after a 7 day RFC (Request for Comment) period on the mailing list.
Access the release timeline on the Trac wiki. Note that minor changes to the dates may occur. If all goes to plan, Beta 3 will be released sometime after the 24th of July. Note that the release will only happen when everything is ready, so there are no final dates and the timeline may change to account for delays.</description></item><item><title>Haiku R1/beta2 has been released!</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2020-06-09_haiku_r1_beta2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2020-06-09_haiku_r1_beta2/</guid><description>After almost 2 years since R1/beta1, Haiku R1/beta2 has been released.

&lt;p>This week I continued work on moving Beta1 forward, fixing some important and less important bugs. To make things clear about what to expect in the upcoming weeks, I will spend more time on Beta1 tasks, but I&amp;rsquo;ll also continue working on WebKit. However, my work there will focus on fixing bugs, rather than adding new features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Haiku Release 1 Alpha 4</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2012-11-12_haiku_release_1_alpha_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2012-11-12_haiku_release_1_alpha_4/</guid><description>

I&amp;rsquo;m proposing myself as a release coordinator for the upcoming Alpha Release, and here are the highlights of the plan.
First, this plan shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be applied before those conditions are met :
the LiveCD works quite good (with no major issues left). My understanding of that topic is that we still need the FS overlay (that allows attributes over iso9660) to support live queries. If there is anything more to add to this point, please comment.</description></item><item><title>Mindmap of the discussion on alpha 1</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/nielx/2008-02-27_mindmap_of_the_discussion_on_alpha_1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 21:59:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/nielx/2008-02-27_mindmap_of_the_discussion_on_alpha_1/</guid><description>A nice overview in mind map format, for those of you interested.</description></item></channel></rss>
