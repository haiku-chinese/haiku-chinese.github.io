We definitely want to improve the current situation. And we need your help.
Haiku currently ships with only one (1) wallpaper, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a complete wallpaper per se, it&amp;rsquo;s just the Haiku logo positioned at fixed coordinates on the screen. To be fair, there is a reason we only use the Haiku logo as the default wallpaper; we want Haiku to be usable on systems that have memory as low as 256 MB, therefore each byte that we can spare counts.</description></item></channel></rss>
