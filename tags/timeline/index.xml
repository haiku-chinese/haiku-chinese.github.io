The updated timeline is here.
The Beta3 release introduces an important update to Haiku WebKit, which subsequently produces some rendering regressions.
While several of the bugs have already been fixed in Haiku WebKit this week, one final bug remains, which involves an issue with disappearing text.</description></item><item><title>Haiku R1/Beta3 Timeline Approved</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-06-14_haiku_r1beta3_timeline_approved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:45:15 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-06-14_haiku_r1beta3_timeline_approved/</guid><description>The release timeline for Haiku R1/Beta 3 has been approved after a 7 day RFC (Request for Comment) period on the mailing list.
