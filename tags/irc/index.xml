I almost forgot to register my IRC nickname at the new service, and having just done that, I take the opportunity to describe how that&amp;rsquo;s done for my fellow - maybe newbie - IRC user.
Configure Vision First, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to configure Vision (or another IRC client) to connect to the OFTC network.
Enter the Network setup and add a new network with the popup menu at the top.</description></item><item><title>Haiku's IRC channels are moving to OFTC!</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-05-19_haiku_is_moving_to_oftc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 07:12:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2021-05-19_haiku_is_moving_to_oftc/</guid><description>After being present for more than 20 years on the Freenode network, we are moving our IRC channels to the OFTC IRC network!
To those not familiar what&amp;rsquo;s happening, Freenode recently went through a major internal reorganization, which resulted in the overwhelming majority of well-established staff members either being forcefully removed or resigning from their roles as administrators of the network.
The OFTC (Open and Free Technology Community) has been around since 2001 and is associated with the 501(c)(3)-registered non-profit organization &amp;ldquo;Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</description></item><item><title>Haiku Network Stack Takes First Baby Steps</title><link>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2006-12-06_haiku_network_stack_takes_first_baby_steps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2006 01:32:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2006-12-06_haiku_network_stack_takes_first_baby_steps/</guid><description>

After &lt;a href="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/haiku-commits/2006-December/009647.html">this commit&lt;/a>, Axel himself and several others have reported successfully running the Vision IRC client in Haiku. Setting up the network requires editing a couple of configuration files, but it should be fairly straighforward for those brave enought to give it a try; Axel explains &lt;a href="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/haiku-commits/2006-December/009649.html">how to do it here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great work Axel!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
