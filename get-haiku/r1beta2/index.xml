Since Beta 1, there have been 101 contributors with over 2800 code commits in total. More than 900 bugs and enhancement tickets have been resolved for this release.
Please keep in mind that this is beta-quality software, which means it is feature complete but still contains known and unknown bugs.</description></item></channel></rss>
